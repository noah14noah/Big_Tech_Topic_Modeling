Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the Department of Justice regarding the threats that foreign adversaries pose to our information security, the vulnerabilities that can arise from doing business in those nations or with companies they can control, and the national security implications of an increasingly integrated internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department's leadership has identified these issues as priorities. Attorney General Barr has emphasized the importance of cybersecurity, having spoken publicly about the risks our telecommunications sector faces, especially from China, and personally announced charges against Chinese military hackers. Prior to that, in February 2018, then-Attorney General Sessions established a Cyber-Digital Task Force to canvass how the Department combats the global cyber threat and to identify how law enforcement can more effectively accomplish its mission in this area. The Task Force's July 2018 report n1 did just that, and I will draw from it in my testimony today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Below I will outline some of the threats we have identified, particularly from foreign nation-states, and how we have responded through our investigations and other operational work, before going on to describe some of the legislative changes that, we believe, would help us better confront them.</p><p>I. Cyber Threats from Foreign Nation States</p><p>A. State-Sponsored Intrusions</p><p>Beginning in 2012, the Department's National Security Division shifted our approach to malicious cyber activity sponsored by foreign nation states. Applying the rationale that all tools of government power should be brought to bear on national security threats, we began opening criminal investigations of state-sponsored computer intrusions and attacks, with the intention of identifying, charging, arresting, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting those responsible according to the same Principles of Federal Prosecution that apply in other, purely criminal contexts. We took this approach based on lessons learned from the counter-terrorism and counter-espionage contexts, where our objectives include a mix of intelligence collection and detection, disruption of illegal activity, and deterrence, and law enforcement has proven effective at those ends, especially when combined with other Executive Branch efforts. Since then, our investigations have exposed a number of disturbing trends.</p><p>First, China, in particular, has for years sponsored computer intrusions to steal trade secrets and other confidential business information from American companies (among others) for the apparent benefit of its own industries, to give them a competitive advantage or to advance its military:</p><p>* In 2014, for example, a grand jury in Pittsburgh, Pa., indicted five Chinese military hackers for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses directed at six American victims in the U.S. nuclear power, metals and solar products industries. According to the indictment, the defendants conspired to steal information from those entities that would be useful to their competitors in China, including state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including trade secrets, communications about business strategy, cost and pricing information, and litigation strategy. n2</p><p>* Later that year, Su Bin, a Chinese engineer, was arrested in Canada at the Department's request, on charges that he conspired with Chinese military officers to target U.S. defense contractors in order to steal military technical data related to aircraft. Su used his expertise to advise the military officers which companies to target, what files to steal, and why it was significant. (He was ultimately sent to federal court in Los Angeles, Cal., where he pled guilty and was sentenced to prison.) n3</p><p>* In October 2018, a San Diego, Cal., grand jury indicted Chinese intelligence officers, among others, on charges of conspiring to steal turbofan technology used in U.S. and European commercial airliners. According to the charges in that case, the defendants relied on computer hackers to infiltrate company networks, but they were assisted by employees of a victim company who were working in China and who are accused of facilitating the computer intrusions. n4</p><p>* And in December 2018, the Department unsealed charges in Manhattan, N.Y., against two Chinese nationals accused of working in association with a Chinese intelligence service (the Ministry of State Security) in a global campaign of computer intrusions targeting managed service providers (MSPs), which are companies that remotely manage the information technology infrastructure of businesses and governments around the world. According to the charges, the conspiracy targeted a diverse array of commercial activity, industries and technologies, including aviation, satellite and maritime technology, industrial factory automation, automotive supplies, laboratory instruments, banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, computer processor technology, information technology services, packaging, consulting, medical equipment, healthcare, biotechnology, pharmaceutical manufacturing, mining, and oil and gas exploration and production. n5 That activity violated China's 2015 commitment to stop stealing trade secrets and other confidential business information through computer hacking \"with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.\" n6</p><p>As we have spoken about in other forums, breaches like these (as well as trade secret thefts committed by company insiders) leach hard-earned intellectual property from American firms, unjustly enrich Chinese firms, and, at scale, threaten our economic security. n7</p><p>Second, China has also targeted large stores of personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), and the like. In February, an Atlanta, Ga., grand jury indicted four Chinese military hackers on charges of hacking into the computer systems of the credit reporting agency Equifax in 2017, where, according to the indictment, they stole names, addresses, birthdates, and social security numbers belonging to nearly half of all American citizens (and driver's license numbers belonging to millions). n8 As the Attorney General said in announcing the charges, this data breach was \"of a piece with other Chinese illegal acquisitions of sensitive personal data,\" including the theft of personnel records from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. n9 Bulk thefts of sensitive personal data like these can support China's development of artificial intelligence tools as well as aid their intelligence services in targeting U.S. government employees and those they work with.</p><p>The Department has been increasingly concerned about the national security consequences of sensitive personal data falling into our adversaries' hands. For a few reasons, the theft of PII, PHI, locational data, electronic communications, and the like is more than an inconvenience and can present more than a risk of criminal identity theft or embarrassment to an individual victim. First, there is vastly more information about us and our habits stored online than there ever was before, and with the proliferation of connected devices, the volume of that information will continue to increase exponentially. n10 Second, while any individual piece of consumer data is probably not a national security secret, a mosaic of personal information can enable computer hackers and intelligence officers alike to better target us, by guessing our passwords, tricking us into responding to a phishing request, or, more darkly, exploiting our weaknesses, fears, or ambitions. Third, the extent to which we are connected to each other (online and otherwise) means that information about people who do not themselves know national security or corporate secrets (perhaps our friends and relatives) can be exploited to target those of us who do. And, fourth, as recent studies have shown, n11 even masked or purely transactional information, when collected in bulk, can be very revealing when mined and analyzed. n12</p><p>All too often, privacy is spoken about as if it is a value opposed to law enforcement. But, in fact, our prosecutions vindicate the right to privacy, whether it is the right of a company to control who has access to its trade secrets; or the expectation of privacy we have in our e-mail communications and medical records. When a company faces retaliation through exposure of its internal communications, a political campaign's e-mails are hacked and dumped, or an Olympic athlete's medical records are exposed online, we will respond to these violations of privacy, both by investigating and charging those responsible (as we have in all of those situations) and by working to mitigate the harm (such as by working with providers and foreign law enforcement in countries where the stolen information is hosted to facilitate takedown requests).</p><p>It is troubling, however, that our efforts to hold nation states and ordinary criminals alike accountable for their violations of privacy (among other crimes) are increasingly stymied by providers that seem determined to frustrate law enforcement access, not just to prevent unauthorized intrusions by bad actors. To be sure, the increasing prevalence of encryption has raised the baseline of protection and privacy we all enjoy, and it has been a net social benefit. As the Attorney General has observed, encryption \"provides enormous benefits to society by enabling secure communications, data storage, and on-line transactions,\" and \"[b]ecause of advances in encryption, we can now better protect our personal information; more securely engage in e-commerce and internet communications; obtain secure software updates; and limit access to sensitive computers, devices, and networks.\" n13 But encryption, like other decisions requiring tradeoffs between functionality and security, is not an all-or-nothing proposition. In the Department of Justice's opinion, in some circumstances, companies have gone well past the point of ensuring, to a high degree of confidence, that unauthorized outsiders cannot compromise the security of your communications, choosing instead to blind both themselves and law enforcement officials attempting to execute court-authorized warrants to the malicious activity occurring on their platforms. In the United States, that decision might qualify as a marketing opportunity. Yet, some of these same companies willingly accommodate the demands of authoritarian regimes by relocating data centers to enable warrantless, bulk surveillance; disabling features and applications used by pro-democracy advocates; and otherwise catering to the whims of the politically powerful, where doing so is a pre-requisite for market access. n14 Their systems design, in other words, reflects a business decision, not an immutable principle. As the Attorney General has said about engaging with the private sector on this issue, it is well past time for the tech community to \"abandon the indefensible posture that a technical solution is not worth exploring, and instead turn their considerable talent and ingenuity to developing products that will reconcile good cybersecurity to the imperative of public safety and national security.\" n15</p><p>B. The Rule of Law</p><p>China is not limited to using intelligence and military officers and their proxies to hack U.S. systems. The legal environment in China--the authorities the Communist Party can bring to bear on Chinese companies and individuals to cooperate, combined with the government's failure to honor its commitments or to respect the rule of law and legal process more generally--has grave implications for trusting Chinese companies beholden to that political party for success.</p><p>Starting in 2014, the Chinese Communist Party began enacting an interrelated package of national security, cyberspace, and law enforcement legislation. They include the 2014 Counterespionage Law, the 2015 National/State Security Law, the 2015 Counterterrorism Law, the 2016 Foreign Non-Governmental Organization Law, the 2017 Cybersecurity Law, and the 2017 National Intelligence Law, and most recently, the 2019 Cryptography Law. Together, these laws reflect President Xi Jinping's effort to transform Chinese national and state security in accordance with his vision of the \"China Model.\" n16 While some of the provisions of these laws could support legitimate, defensive national security activities, the 2017 Cybersecurity Law and the 2017 National Intelligence Law, in particular, impose affirmative legal responsibilities on Chinese and foreign citizens, companies, and organizations operating in China to provide access, cooperation, and support for Beijing's intelligence gathering activities. Other provisions, such as those contained in the 2019 Cryptography Law, impose requirements that will expose commercial encryption used within China to testing and certification by the Chinese government, potentially facilitating those same intelligence activities.</p><p>Article 28 of the 2017 Cybersecurity Law states, \"[n]etwork operators shall provide technical support and assistance to public security organs and national security organs that are safe guarding national security and investigating criminal activities in accordance with the law.\" n17 Article 7 of the 2017 National Intelligence Law states explicitly, \"[a]ny organization and citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law, and maintain the secrecy of all knowledge of state intelligence work.\" n18 Article 26 of the 2019 Cryptography Law requires any \"[c]ommercial cryptography products that involve national security, the national welfare and the people's livelihood, or the societal public interest\" to be tested and certified by Chinese government authorities, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the 2017 Cybersecurity Law. n19 None of these laws provide much, if any, detail about legal procedures or judicial oversight available to challenge Chinese government demands. These laws are not merely defensive in nature: they enable the Chinese government to make affirmative demands on its people and entities to advance the Communist Party's interest.</p><p>While it demands obedience to the law from its firms - as well as foreign firms that choose to operate within its borders - on the one hand, the Chinese government has demonstrated a willingness to break its commitments and disregard our laws, on the other. In 2015, China and the United States agreed to cooperate with requests to investigate computer crime, collect electronic evidence, and mitigate malicious cyber activity emanating from their respective territories. Yet in 2017, when the Department invoked that commitment to request assistance in connection with an investigation of a purported Internet security firm for trade secret theft, we received no meaningful response.</p><p>Since 2001, the United States and China have had a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAA). The Agreement creates an obligation, after one country makes a request to the other, to share evidence and provide other assistance \"in investigations, in prosecutions, and in proceedings related to criminal matters.\" Over the past 10 years, however, China has rarely produced bank records or similar business transactional records pursuant to the United States' MLAA requests. In the few cases where China produced records, they were incomplete, untimely, or inadmissible. n20 On the other hand, when we exercise our authorities as federal prosecutors to compel businesses located here to produce records, the Chinese government threatens them not to comply, on pain of sanctions under their laws. n21 And when a foreign government cooperates with the United States, in our effort to vindicate our laws and protect our people, that government may face threats and reprisals from China, such as economic pressure or even the detention of its nationals on trumped-up charges.</p><p>For these reasons, among others, the Department has been sounding the alarm about Chinese providers that are ultimately subject to direction or control by the Communist Party. All too often we talk about the security of a product or service in a simplistic way: whether there is proof that a company has already conducted illicit surveillance, for example. But if we wait for a smoking gun in this context, we might get shot.</p><p>Whether a company has a culture that promotes theft, dishonesty, or obstruction of justice is just as relevant, because it tells you how the company will behave when it suits its interests. And that is all the more true if the company operates in a legal environment, like China's, where success depends on cooperation with the authorities, no matter how sweeping or illegal their requests. As the Attorney General wrote to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai late last year, urging the FCC to designate Huawei and ZTE as threats to the telecommunications supply chain that are ineligible for FCC programs, \"Surely a willingness to break U.S. law combined with a determination to avoid the consequences by obstructing justice argues against the reliability of a provider.\" n22</p><p>Our cases show that the Chinese government will use the employees of Chinese companies doing business here, and Chinese employees of foreign companies in China, to engage in illegal activity. Last year, for example, a former airline ticket counter agent pleaded guilty to acting as an agent of the Chinese government, without notification to the Attorney General, by working at the direction and control of military officers assigned to China's Mission to the United Nations. During her employment at JFK airport in New York for a Chinese Air Carrier, she accepted packages from PRC military officers, and placed those packages aboard flights to China as unaccompanied luggage or checked in the packages under the names of other passengers flying on those flights. She encouraged her coworkers to assist the military officers, telling them that, because the Air Carrier was a Chinese company, their primary loyalty should be to China. But covertly doing the Chinese military's bidding on U.S. soil is a crime, and the defendant and the Chinese military took advantage of a commercial enterprise to evade legitimate U.S. government oversight, violating TSA regulations. n23</p><p>This record--of intent, capability, and practice of exploiting access to U.S. systems; and of violating our laws and refusing to honor commitments--has led this Administration to take unprecedented steps to protect our critical infrastructure. In July 2018, for example, the Executive Branch recommended that the FCC deny an application for a license to offer international telecommunications services in the United States. The applicant was a subsidiary of China Mobile Communications Corporation (a Chinese state-owned enterprise and the world's largest mobile carrier). The Justice Department led the national security and law enforcement review of the application, and the Executive Branch's recommendation highlights the risks of granting a Chinese SOE common carrier status and, with it, access to trusted, peering relationships with American carriers. n24</p><p>We considered a number of factors, including whether the applicant's planned operations would provide opportunities</p><p>* to disrupt our communications infrastructure;</p><p>* to enable economic espionage; or</p><p>* to undermine authorized law enforcement or national security missions.</p><p>Because China Mobile is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government, we advised the FCC that granting China Mobile's application would pose unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks. And we were gratified when the FCC accepted that recommendation and denied the application, in May 2019.</p><p>Cases like China Mobile have brought home to the Department how important our foreign investment review work is to protecting our equities in law enforcement, counterintelligence, and telecom security.</p><p>* That is why, during the first two years of this Administration, we co-led more CFIUS reviews than in the five years before that, combined.</p><p>* That is why we have renamed the staff that conducts these reviews to be a \"Section,\" and reorganized its management structure, to match other operational components of NSD.</p><p>* And that is why the President's FY2020 budget for the Department significantly increased the staff and other resources devoted to this work; an increase, fortunately, that Congress approved.</p><p>To be clear, China is not the only country whose political and legal environment presents a challenge. As we found during an investigation of a software company that performed contract work for the Defense Department, even an American firm can present risks, depending on where it performs critical functions. In that case, the vendor used a Russian back office to code software intended for a classified network. But under a legal regime known as the Russian System of Operative-Investigative Measures (\"SORM\"), that software was subject to collection by Russia's Federal Security Service (the \"FSB\"), raising a risk that the FSB could gather information about our defense networks. n25 Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security barred federal agencies from using Kaspersky anti-virus software, because it was concerned about the ties between Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence, and because Russian law allows Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky, and to intercept communications on Russian networks. The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicated U.S. national security. n26</p><p>II. New Ideas to Combat Cyber Threats</p><p>In the face of these disturbing and ever-increasing threats, I know the Subcommittee has on its mind a key question: How can Congress help, today? The good news is that, as the Attorney General's Cyber-Digital Task Force concluded, there are several key changes to Federal law that would greatly aid our work to combat threats online.</p><p>A. Data Breach Notification</p><p>In 2018, the White House's Council of Economic Advisors observed that most data breaches are not reported to the U.S. government. n27 This reluctance may be driven by a fear of regulatory action, of reputational harm, or of an interruption to business operations. The reluctance of organizations and businesses to disclose that they have been attacked constitutes a major challenge for the U.S. government in its battle against cybercrime. Law enforcement cannot be effective without the cooperation of crime victims. A lack of cooperation may not only prevent discovery of evidence that could lead to identifying and holding the threat actors accountable, but also creates barriers to fully understanding the threat environment.</p><p>The Department has been actively evaluating statutory data breach notification requirements. Currently, there is no federal reporting requirement or standard. All 50 States have enacted separate notification laws setting standards governing notification by private entities when a data breach occurs, and companies must navigate and comply with the varying requirements in multiple jurisdictions. In the wake of recent high-profile data breaches exposing Americans' personal information, there is revived interest in national notification requirements.</p><p>As you and your colleagues consider a national data breach standard, we would urge you to follow the model of many State statutes and include a requirement to promptly notify law enforcement in addition to, and in advance of, notification of impacted consumers. Government notification would increase Federal law enforcement's ability to pursue hackers and prevent data breaches. The Administration is actively working on proposed legislation, and we look forward to working with Congress on this important issue.</p><p>B. Deterring Insider Threats</p><p>I would like to spend the balance of my time today focusing on areas of concern in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\") and related statutes that currently hamper our work to combat threats online. The CFAA is the primary Federal law against hacking. It protects the public against criminals who intrude into computers to steal information, install malicious software, and delete files. It was also intended to criminalize malicious conduct by insiders who abuse their right of access to computer systems and networks to commit online crime. The CFAA, in short, reflects our baseline expectation that people are entitled to have control over their own computers and are entitled to trust that the information they store in their computers remains safe.</p><p>The CFAA was enacted in 1986, at a time when the problem of online crime was still in its infancy. Over the years, Congress has enacted a series of measured, modest changes to the CFAA to encompass new technologies and to equip law enforcement to respond to changing threats. The CFAA has not been amended since 2008, however, and the intervening years have again witnessed the need for the enactment of modest, incremental changes. The CFAA needs to be updated to make sure that it continues to appropriately deter violations of Americans' privacy and security.</p><p>At its core, the CFAA is a privacy statute, because it deters criminals from stealing peoples' information. Yet, the CFAA's privacy protections now contain a significant gap. The statute was meant to apply both to hackers who gain access to victim computers without authorization from halfway around the world, and to so-called \"insiders\" who have some authorization to access a computer -- like company employees entitled to access a sensitive database for specified work purposes -- but who intentionally abuse that access. The part of the CFAA that covers the conduct of those who have some authorization to access a computer is the tool that Department prosecutors have used to charge, for example, police officers who misuse their access to confidential criminal records databases in order to look up sensitive information about a boyfriend or girlfriend, who sell access to private records to others, or who provide confidential law enforcement information to a charged drug trafficker. As a recent survey of 472 cybersecurity professionals indicated, 90% percent of organizations feel vulnerable to insider attacks, and 53% have confirmed insider attacks against their organization in the previous 12 months. The survey also found that the type of data most vulnerable to insider attacks is confidential business information, and that a plurality of those surveyed estimated that the potential cost/loss of an insider attack was between $100,000 and $500,000. n28</p><p>Unfortunately, recent judicial decisions have limited the Government's ability to prosecute such cases. As a result, in circuits covered by these decisions, insiders cannot be charged under the CFAA -- even where the insider has intentionally exceeded the bounds of his legitimate access to confidential information and has caused significant harm to his employer and to the people, often everyday Americans, whose data he has improperly accessed.</p><p>The insider threat is relevant to voting security. Currently, for example, if a foreign hacker accessed a State's voter registration database over the Internet, that could be charged under the CFAA as an access \"without authorization.\" But if an insider, such as a State government employee, used his privileges to access the same information, that insider could not be prosecuted under the CFAA, at least as several courts have interpreted the statute.</p><p>The narrow judicial interpretation of the term \"exceeds authorized access\" in the CFAA stems from concerns that the statute potentially makes relatively trivial conduct a Federal crime. We understand the concerns of the courts, and I would like to reiterate that the Department of Justice has no interest in prosecuting harmless violations, to the extent that the statute could be construed to cover them.</p><p>However, by essentially barring CFAA prosecutions of insiders in certain circuits, these court decisions have constrained our ability to bring certain cybercriminals to justice. Over the last several years, numerous Department of Justice officials have called on Congress to address this issue in a manner that would maintain the law's key privacy-protecting function, while providing further reassurance that trivial violations of things like a website's terms of service will not be prosecuted as Federal crimes.</p><p>The Department supports efforts that would accomplish this task. This can be done by reaffirming that the definition of \"exceeds authorized access\" includes the situation where the person accesses the computer for a purpose that he knows is not authorized by the computer owner. Such an amendment is necessary to ensure the nationwide ability to prosecute, for example, a law enforcement officer who is permitted access to criminal records databases, but only for official business purposes. At the same time, a legislative fix could add further limitations that reflect the statute's focus. For example, a limitation could be put into the CFAA making clear that in order to constitute a crime under the new insider provision, not only must an offender access a protected computer in excess of authorization and obtain information, but the information must be worth $5,000 or more, the access must be in furtherance of a separate felony offense, or the information must be stored on a government computer.</p><p>We strongly believe that the insider threat problem in the CFAA can be fixed in a way that empowers the Department to prosecute and deter significant threats to privacy and security and further assures that prosecutions will remain focused on such crimes. Of all of the reforms to the CFAA under consideration by this Subcommittee, addressing this problem would have the most immediate, significant impact in improving our ability to punish and deter cybercriminals. We would like to work closely with Congress and, specifically, this Subcommittee, to find a way forward on this pressing issue.</p><p>C. Certain Malicious Activities as RICO Predicates</p><p>We support the efforts to update the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") to make CFAA offenses and certain Wiretap Act offenses subject to RICO as was proposed in the International Cybercrime Prevention Act (\"ICPA\"), which was sponsored by Senator Graham and the Ranking Member in the last Congress. As computer technology has evolved, it has become a key tool of organized crime. Criminal organizations operating around the world hack into public and private computer systems, including systems key to America's national security and defense. They hijack computers to steal Americans' identity and financial information; they extort American businesses with threats to disrupt computers; and they commit a range of other online crimes.</p><p>Accordingly, much of the fight against transnational organized crime has moved online. Federal prosecutors have used RICO for over forty years to prosecute organized criminals ranging from mob bosses to Hells Angels to members of MS-13. Just as RICO has proven to be an effective tool to prosecute the leaders of these organizations who may not have been directly involved in committing the underlying crimes, it should be a tool to fight criminal organizations that use computer intrusions and other CFAA violations to further their schemes. These changes, as proposed in ICPA, would simply make clear that all types of CFAA violations should be considered criminal activities under the RICO statute, with the associated heavy penalties.</p><p>D. Protecting Election Computers from Attack</p><p>Protecting election infrastructure from attack is another important goal. Yet, as the Department's recent Cyber-Digital Task Force report noted, \"should hacking of a voting machine occur, the government would not, in many conceivable circumstances, be able to use the CFAA to prosecute the hackers.\" n29 The CFAA's current definition of \"protected computer\" includes computers \"affecting interstate or foreign commerce,\" a definition that attempts to encompass the breadth of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. We are concerned that courts might conclude that the Commerce Clause power, alone, does not reach voting machine computers that are not used in a commercial setting, are not used in interstate communication, and are typically never connected to the Internet or to any other network.</p><p>The Department and each of its components has consistently recognized the primacy of State and local jurisdictions in the administration and policing of electoral processes under Article I, Section 4, of the Constitution. Accordingly, the Department remains committed to its longstanding policy in criminal law enforcement against operations, actions, or public statements that would interfere with State and local election administration, or appear to do so. Nevertheless, the Constitution in that same Section also provides for a federal role in regulating elections that include federal candidates on the ballot, and we believe that this provision provides additional support for an amendment that would cover election-related hacking.</p><p>Expanding the definition of a protected computer to include electronic voting machines will strengthen confidence in the integrity of our electoral system and ensure that any attempts to manipulate the results of an election can be prosecuted to the fullest extent under Federal law. We therefore applaud the Senate's passage of the Defending the Integrity of Voting Systems Act last year, which would accomplish this important goal.</p><p>E. Botnets</p><p>Another striking example of online crime that victimizes Americans is the threat from botnets -- networks of victim computers surreptitiously infected with malicious software, or \"malware.\" Once a computer is infected with malware, it can be controlled remotely from another computer with a so-called \"command and control\" server. Using that control, criminals (including nation-state actors) can steal usernames, passwords, and other personal and financial information from the computer user, or hold computers and computer systems for ransom. Criminals can also use armies of infected computers to commit other crimes, such as DDoS attacks, or to conceal their identities and locations while perpetrating crimes ranging from drug dealing to online child sexual exploitation.</p><p>The scale and sophistication of the threat posed by botnets is increasing every day. Individual hackers and organized criminal groups are using state-of-the-art techniques to infect hundreds of thousands -- sometimes millions -- of computers and cause massive financial losses, all while becoming increasingly difficult to detect. If we want security to keep pace with criminals' technological innovations, we need to ensure that we have a variety of effective tools to combat rapidly evolving cyber threats like these.</p><p>One powerful tool that the Department has used to disrupt botnets and free victim computers from criminal malware is the civil injunction process. Current law gives Federal courts the authority to issue injunctions to stop the ongoing commission of certain crimes by authorizing actions that prevent a continuing and substantial injury. This authority played a critical role in the Department's successful disruption of the Coreflood botnet in 2011 and of the Gameover Zeus botnet in 2014. (The Gameover Zeus botnet, which infected computers worldwide, inflicted over $100 million in losses on American victims alone, many of them small- and medium-sized businesses.) Because the criminals behind these particular botnets used them to commit fraud against banks and bank customers, existing law allowed the Department to obtain court authority to disrupt the botnets by taking actions such as disabling communications between infected computers and the command and control servers.</p><p>The problem is that current law permits courts to consider injunctions only for limited categories of crimes, including certain frauds and illegal wiretapping. Botnets, however, can be used for many different types of illegal activity. They can be used to steal sensitive corporate information, to harvest email account addresses, to hack other computers, or to execute denial of service attacks against websites or other computers. Yet -- depending on the facts of any given case -- these crimes may not constitute fraud or illegal wiretapping. In those cases, courts may lack the statutory authority to consider an application by prosecutors for an injunction to disrupt the botnets in the same way that injunctions were successfully used to incapacitate the Coreflood and Gameover Zeus botnets.</p><p>Thus, we support the provision in ICPA that would add activities like the operation of a malicious botnet to the list of offenses eligible for injunctive relief. ICPA would allow the Department to seek an injunction to prevent ongoing hacking violations in cases where 100 or more victim computers have been hacked. This numerical threshold focuses the injunctive authority on enjoining the creation, maintenance, operation, or use of a malicious botnet, as well as other widespread attacks on computers using malicious software (such as ransomware).</p><p>The same legal safeguards that currently apply to obtaining civil injunctions, and that applied to the injunctions obtained by the Department in the Coreflood and Gameover Zeus cases, would also apply under the ICPA proposal. Before an injunction is issued, the Government must civilly sue the defendant and demonstrate to a court that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its lawsuit and that the public interest favors an injunction; the defendants and enjoined parties have the right to notice and to have a hearing before a permanent injunction is issued; and the defendants and enjoined parties may move to quash or modify any injunctions that the court issues.</p><p>I would now like to turn to the criminal statutes that prohibit the creation and use of botnets. Unfortunately, these statutes also contain shortcomings. We find that criminals continue to find new ways to make money illegally through botnets. Law enforcement officers now frequently observe that creators and operators of botnets not only use botnets for their own illicit purposes, but also sell or even rent access to the infected computers to other criminals.</p><p>Current criminal law prohibits the creation of a malicious botnet because it prohibits hacking into computers without authorization. It also prohibits the use of botnets to commit other crimes. But it is not similarly clear that the law prohibits the sale or renting of a botnet. In one case, for example, undercover officers discovered that a criminal was offering to sell a botnet consisting of thousands of victim computers. The officers accordingly \"bought\" the botnet from the criminal and notified the victims that their computers were infected. The operation, however, did not result in a prosecutable U.S. offense because there was no evidence that the seller himself had created the botnet in question. While trafficking in botnets is sometimes chargeable under other subsections of the CFAA, this problem has resulted in, and will increasingly result in, the inability to prosecute individuals selling or renting access to thousands of hacked computers.</p><p>We believe that it should be illegal to sell or rent surreptitious control over infected computers to another person, just like it is already clearly illegal to sell or transfer computer passwords. That is why we support the provision in ICPA to prohibit the sale or transfer not only of \"password[s] and similar information\" (the wording of the existing statute) but also of \"means of access,\" which would include the ability to access computers that were previously hacked and are now part of a botnet. In addition, we recommend replacing the current requirement that the Government prove that the offender had an \"intent to defraud\" with a requirement to prove that the offender not only knew his conduct is \"wrongful,\" but also that he knew or should have known that the means of access would be used to hack or damage a computer. This last change is necessary because, as noted above, criminals do not use botnets only to commit fraud -- they also use them to commit a variety of other crimes.</p><p>Some commentators have raised the concern that this proposal would chill the activities of legitimate security researchers, academics, and system administrators. The Department takes this concern seriously. We have no interest in prosecuting such individuals, and our proposal would not prohibit legitimate activity. That is because the Government should have the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the individual intentionally undertook an act (trafficking in a means of access) that he or she knew to be wrongful. The Government should similarly have to prove that the individual knew or had reason to know that the means of access would be used to commit a crime by hacking someone else's computer without authorization.</p><p>ICPA's approach makes clear that ordinary conduct by legitimate security researchers and others is not a crime. We believe that ICPA's botnet injunction provision strikes the proper balance in prohibiting the pernicious conduct I have described without chilling the activities of those who are trying to improve cybersecurity for us all.</p><p>F. Enhanced Penalties for Malicious Activity Directed at Critical Infrastructure</p><p>The Department also supports the efforts in ICPA to strengthen the criminal code to better deter malicious activities directed at computers and networks that control our critical infrastructures. As I have discussed, America's open and technologically complex society includes, as a part of its critical infrastructure, numerous vulnerable targets. While the CFAA's maximum penalties apply to malicious efforts to harm the computers and networks that run our critical infrastructure, the statute does not currently require any enhanced penalties for such conduct. While it is reasonable to believe that judges would impose appropriate prison terms if malicious activity severely debilitates a critical infrastructure system, it is possible that courts may not impose adequate penalties for activities that cause less disruption -- and they could conceivably impose no penalty at all in the case of an attempt that is thwarted before it is completed.</p><p>In light of the grave risk posed by those who might compromise our critical infrastructure, the Department believes that the enhanced penalties for such malicious activity called for in ICPA not only will appropriately punish offenders, but also will more effectively deter others who would engage in misconduct that puts public safety and national security at risk. Criminals and other malicious actors should know that any attempt to damage a vital national resource will result in serious consequences.</p><p>G. Updated Tools for Investigators and Prosecutors</p><p>We have long had concerns about the text of the \"Pen Register and Trap and Trace\" (\"PRTT\") statute that is used, among other things, to support criminal investigations and the security of government networks. The PRTT statute's exceptions -- which, for example, permit a provider, but not a user, of wire or electronic communications services to monitor their own network -- are subtly and inexplicably different than the Wiretap Act's exceptions. The existing language in the PRTT statute has been difficult to apply, resulting in complex legal analyses for services as simple as Caller ID. The Wiretap Act's rules appropriately protect the content of communications; they are more than adequate to protect non-content information, which is much less sensitive. Importing the Wiretap Act's exceptions into the PRTT statute would remedy these problems and result in a more logical framework for applying these two related statutes that regulate the real-time collection of communications. There is no reason why a user of a PRTT device, whether a private or governmental entity, should be precluded from logging his or her own communications. We have proposed language under which the PRTT statute would continue to protect user privacy, but it would no longer inappropriately limit private entities' or the Government's ability to use PRTT devices on their own computer networks.</p><p>Finally, we support several amendments to the CFAA, which are reflected in the ICPA. Key amongst these changes would be amendments to 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 2513, which would bring the forfeiture provisions of the CFAA in line with other Federal criminal statutes, providing concrete procedures for the forfeiture of property used to commit or facilitate a violation of this statute as well as the proceeds of such violation. These amendments support consistent application of the law, while maintaining the Government's ability to dismantle and disrupt criminal operations and deter future violations, both when prosecutors are able to reach violators and when those violators are located overseas beyond the judicial reach of our courts. The amendments in ICPA are a measured and sensible addition that will help assure that criminal hackers do not profit from their crimes.</p><p>We also support the change in ICPA that would make the sale or advertising of a surreptitious interception device under 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 2512 a predicate offense under the Federal money laundering statutes. Section 2512, which is part of the Wiretap Act, has proven to be a valuable tool for protecting the privacy of innocent Americans by criminalizing the manufacture, distribution, possession, and advertising of devices, such as spyware, that unlawfully collect private communications. Section 2512 is not a predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. [Subsec.] 1956 and 1957, however, which impedes the Government's ability to punish and deter certain offenders who conceal and spend their ill-gotten gains by selling and advertising spyware and other illegal interception devices.</p><p>H. Assuring Jurisdiction of Thefts of U.S. Companies' Trade Secrets</p><p>The Economic Espionage Act recognizes that trade secret theft frequently involves an international component (and section 1831 of Title 18 specifically criminalizes trade secret theft committed for the benefit of foreign instrumentalities). However, since the statute came into force in 1996, manufacturing, research, and development have become increasingly dispersed geographically. Just as manufacturing supply chains often cross borders, U.S. firms conduct research and development across international borders, with collaboration between facilities in multiple countries. With this trend, U.S. companies face increasing risk that their trade secrets may be stolen from facilities they own or operate outside U.S. borders.</p><p>Under the current EEA, the Department can prosecute trade secret thefts occurring abroad, but only where either (1) the defendant(s) are U.S. persons or organizations, or (2) an act in furtherance of the offense is committed in the United States. 18 U.S.C. [Sec.] 1837. One illustration of the EEA's extraterritorial reach is the Department's ongoing prosecution of United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., and three Taiwan nationals for theft of trade secrets belonging to Micron Technologies. In that case, the defendants are charged with stealing trade secrets from a Micron facility in Taiwan, but acts in furtherance of the theft were committed within the U.S. However, it is easy to imagine future cases in which trade secrets owned by a U.S. company may be stolen by foreign nationals from facilities outside the U.S., which would fall outside the extraterritorial reach of the current statute. To address this scenario, Congress could amend Section 1837 to permit jurisdiction over extraterritorial conduct, at least in criminal cases, where \"the trade secret owner injured as a result of the offense conduct is a natural person who is a citizen or permanent resident alien of the United States, or an organization organized under the laws of the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof.\"</p><p>III. Conclusion</p><p>I want to thank the Subcommittee again for providing me this opportunity to discuss these important issues on behalf of the Department of Justice. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to improve the Government's ability to counter threats posed by our foreign adversaries in cyberspace. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.</p><p>n1 U.S. DEP'T OF JUSTICE, REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CYBER DIGITAL TASK FORCE (2018), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1076696/download\">https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1076696/download</url> [hereinafter Report].</p><p>n2 Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage (May 19, 2014), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor</url>.</p><p>n3 Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Chinese National Who Conspired to Hack into U.S. Defense Contractors' Systems Sentenced to 46 Months in Federal Prison (July 13, 2016), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-national-who-conspired-hack-us-defense-contractors-systems-sentenced-46-months\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-national-who-conspired-hack-us-defense-contractors-systems-sentenced-46-months</url>.</p><p>n4 Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Chinese Intelligence Officers and Their Recruited Hackers and Insiders Conspired to Steal Sensitive Commercial Aviation and Technological Data for Years (Oct. 30, 2018), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-intelligence-officers-and-their-recruited-hackers-and-insiders-conspired-steal\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-intelligence-officers-and-their-recruited-hackers-and-insiders-conspired-steal</url>.</p><p>n5 Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Two Chinese Hackers Associated With the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaigns Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information (Dec. 20, 2018), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion</url>.</p><p>n6 Deputy Attorney General Rod J.

In regulations implementing this authority, CFIUS defined \"sensitive personal data\" for purposes of its jurisdiction by describing categories of identifiable data that could potentially implicate national security, including financial data that could be used to analyze or determine an individual's distress or hardship, consumer report information, insurance applications, health information, non-public electronic communications, geolocation data, biometric data, government identification information, security clearance status, government employment applications, and genetic tests. 85 Fed.

CISA works every day to support the private sector and the American people's efforts and responsibilities to secure their corporate and personal data, the focus of today's hearing. Safeguarding and securing cyberspace is a core mission of DHS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At CISA, our mission is to defend against the threats of today, while working with partners across all levels of government and in the private sector to secure against the evolving risks of tomorrow - \"Defend Today, Secure Tomorrow.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Understanding the Threat</p><p>Cyber threats remain one of the most significant strategic risks for the United States, threatening our national security, economic prosperity, and public health and safety. We continue to see malicious threat actors, including hackers, cyber criminals, and nation-states, increase the frequency and sophistication of their attacks. In a 2018 report, Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace, the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center stated, \"We anticipate that China, Russia, and Iran will remain aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace.\" Our adversaries and strategic competitors are developing and using advanced cyber capabilities in attempts to undermine critical infrastructure, target our livelihoods and innovation, steal our national security secrets, and threaten our democratic institutions.</p><p>Increasingly, most discussions around cybersecurity threats include some risk calculation related to supply chain, third party, or vendor assurance risk. In 2018, cybersecurity firm Symantec reported the number of observed supply chain attacks was 78 percent higher in 2018 than it was in 2017, as malicious actors sought to exploit vulnerabilities in third-party software, hardware, and services.</p><p>Supply chain risk can broadly be understood as efforts by our adversaries to exploit information and communications technologies (ICT) and their related supply chains for purposes of espionage, sabotage, foreign interference, and criminal activity. Vulnerabilities in supply chains - either developed intentionally for malicious intent or unintentionally, including through poor security practices - can enable data and intellectual property theft, loss of confidence in the integrity of the system, or exploitation to cause system and network failure. More often, our adversaries are looking at these vulnerabilities as a principal attack vector, and we are greatly concerned with aggressive actions by potential foreign adversaries and strategic competitors to include Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.</p><p>Roles and Responsibilities</p><p>CISA, our government partners, and the private sector are all engaging in a more strategic and unified approach towards improving our Nation's overall defensive posture against malicious cyber activity. In May 2018, the Department published the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy, outlining a strategic framework to execute our cybersecurity responsibilities during the next five years. The National Cyber Strategy, released in September 2018, reiterates the criticality of collaboration and strengthens the government's commitment to work in partnership with industry to combat cyber threats and secure our critical infrastructure. Together, the National Cyber Strategy and DHS Cybersecurity Strategy guide CISA's efforts.</p><p>CISA works across government and industry partnerships to lead the national effort to safeguard and secure cyberspace. We share timely and actionable classified and unclassified information as well as provide training and technical assistance, and we do this with attention to protecting privacy, civil liberties and confidentiality. Our work enhances cyber threat information sharing between and among governments and businesses across the globe to stop cyber incidents before they occur and quickly recover when they do. By bringing together the intelligence community, law enforcement, the Department of Defense, Sector-Specific Agencies, all levels of government, the private sector, international partners, and the public, we are enabling collective defense against cybersecurity risks, improving incident response capabilities, enhancing information sharing of best practices and cyber threats, strengthening our resilience, and facilitating safety.</p><p>CISA provides entities with technical assistance and guidance they can use to secure their networks, systems, assets, information, and data by reducing vulnerabilities, ensuring resilience to cyber incidents, and supporting their holistic risk management priorities. CISA operates at the intersection of the Federal Government, state and local governments, the private sector, international partners, law enforcement, intelligence, and defense communities. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-113) established DHS as the Federal Government's central hub for sharing cyber threat indicators and defensive measures. CISA's automated indicator sharing capability allows the Federal Government and private sector network defenders to share technical information at machine speed, without eroding privacy protections or civil liberties.</p><p>CISA provides a broad range of capabilities to assist private sector entities across all 16 sectors of critical infrastructure. In addition to information sharing and incident response, these capabilities include assessments and technical services as well as recommended remediation and mitigation techniques that improve the cybersecurity posture of the Nation. Among other services, these include vulnerability scanning and testing, penetration testing, phishing assessments, and red teaming on operational technology that includes the industrial control systems which operate our nation's critical infrastructure.</p><p>Supply Chain Risks</p><p>There are also steps we can take to secure the hardware agencies and entities use to build their networks and the software that runs those networks. ICT is critical to every business's ability to carry out its mission efficiently and effectively. Vulnerabilities can be exploited intentionally or unintentionally through a variety of means, including deliberate mislabeling and counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, and insertion of malicious software or hardware. If these risks are not detected and mitigated, the impact to the ICT supply chain could be a fundamental degradation of its confidentiality, integrity, or availability and potentially create adverse impacts to essential government or critical infrastructure systems.</p><p>In 2018, CISA established the Information and Communication Technology Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force as a public-private partnership jointly chaired by CISA and the chairs of the Information Technology (IT) and Communications Sector Coordinating Councils. The Task Force is working to identify and manage risks to the global ICT supply chain and is comprised of 40 industry partners from the IT and Communications Sectors and 20 interagency partners from the United States Government.</p><p>In its first year, the Task Force focused on four priority areas of policy concern for supply chain risk management, including: Information Sharing, Threat Evaluation, Qualified Bidder Lists and Qualified Manufacture Lists, and Policy Recommendations to Incentive Purchase of ICT from Original Equipment Manufacturers and Authorized Resellers.</p><p>In September of 2019, the Task Force released an Interim Report providing a status update on activities and objectives of the Task Force. The report outlines the overall structure of the Task Force, including the four Working Groups, areas of discussion, and relevant key findings. The Interim Report serves as an important building block for the second year of the Task Force, including strategic priorities and recommendations.</p><p>Among these priorities is enhancing information sharing about supply chain risks with a particular focus on potential adversaries. The Task Force identified current gaps in the ability of government to collect relevant information on bad actors, the ability to use that information as part of an overall evaluation of trusted vendors, and the ability for that information to be shared with the private sector. Crucially, the Task Force also identified limitations on private-to-private information sharing regarding supply chain risks because of lingering legal concerns. Going forward, the Task Force is establishing a Working Group of lawyers from industry and government to address these hurdles and make recommendations for legal and regulatory changes; in addition, the Task Force is likely to identify the necessary components of an enhanced information sharing environment that can take advantage of factors that contribute to understanding as to whether vendors can be trusted.</p><p>Another effort of the Task Force will be related to taking the output from the Threat Evaluation Working Group - which identified nine types of supply chain threats and related scenarios - and making recommendations as to how the identified threats and threat scenarios can inform risk management programs for government agencies, and large and small businesses alike. These threats - whether from counterfeit parts, insider threats, poor cybersecurity practices, or market forces - need to be accounted for in effective supply chain risk management programs.</p><p>On May 15, 2019, the President signed Executive Order (EO) 13873: Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain. This EO declares a national emergency with respect to the threat posed by foreign adversaries to the Nation's information and communications technology supply chain. Specifically, the EO addresses concerns that \"foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services, which store and communicate vast amounts of sensitive information, facilitate the digital economy, and support critical infrastructure and vital emergency services, in order to commit malicious cyber-enabled actions, including economic and industrial espionage against the United States and its people. \"DHS, specifically CISA, plays a key role in the EO, which requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \"assess and identify entities, hardware, software, and services that present vulnerabilities that pose the greatest potential consequences to the national security of the United States.\" CISA coordinated with federal and private partners to assess what ICT hardware, software, and services (referred to individually in this report as elements) present the greatest vulnerabilities in U.S. infrastructure and pose the greatest consequences, this assessment was completed in August 2019.</p><p>Mitigating the Risks</p><p>CISA works with our private sector partners every day to help them protect their networks and their data from bad actors, using some of the previously-mentioned tools and coordination activities. However, as we work with the private sector to help them secure their information, CISA has published the Cyber Essentials guide for leaders of small business and small and local government to show basic steps that can be taken on their own to improve their cybersecurity posture:</p><p>* Employ a backup solution that automatically and continuously backs up critical data and system configurations;</p><p>* Enable automatic updates whenever possible;</p><p>* Replace unsupported operating systems, applications, and hardware; and</p><p>* Test and deploy patches quickly.</p><p>Along with these steps, companies must develop a culture, at all levels, that reinforces cybersecurity essentials. Corporate leaders should drive cybersecurity strategy, investment, and culture by learning how much of their organization's operations are dependent on IT and by leading the development of cybersecurity policies. Promoting security awareness and vigilance through training and maintaining awareness of cyber risks among all employees is vital. Critical assets and applications must be protected through implementing secure hardware and software configurations and leveraging email and web browser security settings to protect against spoofed or modified emails and unsecured webpages. Companies must manage their operational footprint, access, and identities to ensure that only those that require access to the corporate network receive permissions. Knowing who is on your network, using multi-factor authentication for administrative privileges and remote access, and issuing unique passwords for all user accounts is important in this area. Finally, information should always be backed up and protected by instituting rules such as establishing regular automated backups and redundancies of key systems and deploying malware protection capabilities, with an organization's most critical data encrypted, including Personally Identifiable Information, or PII, particularly when it is \"at rest,\" in storage.</p><p>Even if an organization implements these steps, it must be ready and prepared to respond and recover from a potential cyber incident and breach of personal data. Companies should develop incident response and disaster recovery plans, as well as a personal data breach response plan. Business impact assessments should be leveraged to prioritize resources and identify which systems must be recovered first. Internal reporting structures must be built to detect, communicate and contain an attack. IT security officials should have already determined who to call for help when an incident takes place, whether it is outside partners, vendors, government/industry responders such as CISA, technical advisors or law enforcement. Planning should occur before a potential cyber incident to determine which in-house containment measures can be applied to limit the impact of the cyber incident when it occurs.</p><p>Administrative Subpoena Authorities</p><p>Finally, CISA supports Congress's efforts to address a significant gap in the protection of critical infrastructure through the introduction of legislation, such as the Cybersecurity and Vulnerability Disclosure Act (S. 3045). Today, our Nation's adversaries can use publicly available, easily accessible tools to detect vulnerable systems operating our Nation's critical infrastructure that are connected to the public internet. While CISA is aware of these vulnerable online systems operating critical infrastructure, the Agency is unable to identify the vulnerable system's owners or operators.</p><p>The Internet service providers (ISPs), who can identify and provide contact information for these operators, are generally prohibited by law from disclosing this information to the federal government. If Congress provides CISA with a legal mechanism to obtain very limited information regarding the contact details for the affected entity, the Internet service providers could legally provide it.</p><p>The authority CISA seeks is limited in scope and would provide the Agency with a necessary tool to help secure our Nation's critical infrastructure from cyber-attacks. CISA does not seek to change the voluntary nature of our cybersecurity support to industry. Ultimately, our goal is to enable that broader collective defense against cybersecurity threats, where government and industry understand the risks we face and are prepared to defend against them. We look forward to working with Congress on this legislation.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In the face of increasingly sophisticated threats, CISA employees stand on the front lines of the Federal Government's efforts to defend our Nation's networks and critical infrastructure. The threat environment is complex and dynamic with interdependencies that add to the challenge. As new risks emerge, we must better integrate cyber and physical risk responses in order to effectively secure the Nation. CISA contributes unique expertise and capabilities to mitigate cyber-physical risk.</p><p>I recognize and appreciate the Subcommittee's strong support and diligence as it works to understand this evolving risk and identify additional authorities and resources needed to address it head on. We at CISA are committed to working with Congress to ensure our efforts cultivate a safer, more secure, and resilient Homeland through our efforts to defend today and secure tomorrow.</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Subcommittee today, and I look forward to your questions.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/ware-testimonyanddownload=1\">https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/ware-testimonyanddownload=1</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSC304035L1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBY-TN61-DYVR-P1YR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2799\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 4, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000236R</classCode><className>SYMANTEC CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS334614 SOFTWARE &amp;

Our nation continues to face a multitude of serious and evolving threats ranging from homegrown violent extremists (\"HVEs\") to cyber criminals to hostile foreign intelligence services and operatives. Keeping pace with these threats is a significant challenge for the FBI. Our adversaries -- terrorists, foreign intelligence services, and criminals -- take advantage of modern technology to hide their communications; recruit followers; and plan and encourage espionage, cyber-attacks, or terrorism to disperse information on different methods to attack the U.S. homeland, and to facilitate other illegal activities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cyber Threats</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Virtually every national security threat and crime problem the FBI faces is cyber-based or facilitated. We face threats from state-sponsored hackers, hackers for hire, organized cyber syndicates, and terrorists. On a daily basis, these actors seek to steal our state secrets, our trade secrets, our technology, and our ideas -- things of incredible value to all of us and of great importance to the conduct of our government business and our national security. They seek to hold our critical infrastructure at risk and to harm our economy.</p><p>The FBI is investigating a wider-than-ever range of threat actors, from transnational organized cybercrime to nation-state adversaries to terrorists using social medial for recruiting and radicalization purposes. The scale, scope, speed and impact of cyber threats is constantly evolving, which may explain why we are also seeing a blending of threats, such as nation state adversaries using criminal actors as proxies to mask their activities.</p><p>The frequency and severity of malicious cyber activity on our nation's networks have increased dramatically in the past decade when measured by the amount of corporate data stolen or deleted, the volume of personally identifiable information compromised, or the remediation costs incurred by U.S. victims. Companies that hold large amounts of Personally Identifiable Information (\"PII\") are susceptible to loss of American's personal data to criminal organizations, terrorists, and nation-state cyber actors. Hotel chains, airlines, healthcare companies, credit bureaus, government agencies, and cleared defense contractors have previously been victims of PII theft.</p><p>Cyber Criminal Trends</p><p>Cyber threats are not only increasing in size and scope, but are also becoming increasingly difficult and resource-intensive to investigate. Cyber criminals often operate through online forums, selling illicit goods and services, including tools that lower the barrier to entry for aspiring criminals and that can be used to facilitate malicious cyber activity. These criminals have also increased the sophistication of their schemes, which are more difficult to detect and more resilient to disruption than ever. In addition, whether located at home or abroad, many cyber actors are obfuscating their identities and obscuring their activity by using combinations of leased and compromised infrastructure in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Such tactics make coordination with all of our partners, including international law enforcement partners, essential.</p><p>Increasingly sophisticated obfuscation techniques are also enabling actors to stealthily obtain data from victims or repurpose victim computers into cryptocurrency-mining botnets. Botnets used by cyber criminals have been responsible for billions of dollars in damages over the past several years. The widespread availability of malicious software (\"malware\") that can create botnets allows individuals to leverage the combined bandwidth of thousands, if not millions, of compromised computers, servers, or network-ready devices to disrupt the day-to-day activities of governments, businesses, and individual Americans.</p><p>Cyber threat actors are conducting ransomware attacks against U.S. systems, encrypting data and rendering systems unusable -- thereby victimizing individuals, businesses, and even emergency service and public health providers. Our threat reporting has demonstrated that ransomware attacks are becoming more targeted, sophisticated, and costly, even as the overall frequency of ransomware attacks is holding steady or declining. Since early 2018, the incidence of broad, indiscriminate ransomware campaigns has sharply declined, while losses from ransomware attacks have increased significantly. Allow me to restate that for emphasis: while the number of reported attacks has gone down, the effects and impacts of the attacks are going up. Meanwhile, state and local governments have been particularly visible targets for ransomware attacks. However, ransomware campaigns have also heavily impacted health care organizations, industrial companies, and the transportation sector.</p><p>Business Email Compromise (\"BEC\") remains a pervasive threat due to its low barrier of entry and maturing social engineering techniques, and cyber criminals almost certainly will continue to use BEC to target industries indiscriminately. BEC threat actors have widened their money laundering networks, including domestic transfers prior to laundering the money overseas, which presents challenges and opportunities for countering this type of fraud. Readily available online personal and business information enhances the reconnaissance capability of actors, providing BEC threat actors with more credible social engineering lures. Spoofed domains are seen in the majority of BEC attempts, and likely will remain a technique used by cyber actors. BEC attacks combining social engineering with network intrusions demonstrate an increase in attack sophistication that can use keyloggers or other malware to identify potential targets, such as business vendors, as well as sell access to or further exploit compromised systems.</p><p>Actors have learned that BEC is effective and are adapting lures to target human resources departments for PII, such as W-2 tax forms to commit stolen identity return fraud, rather than requesting wire transfers. Additionally, industry partners have observed BEC actors increasingly instruct victims to send automated clearing house transfers to prepaid cards in the initial laundering phase.</p><p>Nation State Activities: China</p><p>While several nation-states pose a cyber threat to U.S. interests, no other country presents a broader and more comprehensive threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\") under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (\"CCP\"). The threat takes many different forms. Beijing employs a whole-of-government approach to its intelligence collection strategy. While cyber network operations remain a primary and possibly increasing collection tool, the CCP also relies on techniques such as intellectual property theft, purchases of U.S. corporations, and physical and property theft to acquire U.S. data.</p><p>For example, less than a month ago, on February 10, 2020, the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), in coordination with the FBI, publicly unsealed an indictment against four Chinese cyber actors who allegedly acted as agents of the People's Republic of China's People's Liberation Army (\"PLA\"). All four actors are currently located in China. The alleged crimes occurred between May 13, 2017 and July 30, 2017. The actors targeted a software vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to Equifax's network and ultimately obtain PII for 145 million American citizens as well as the intellectual property of the U.S. company.</p><p>The indictment alleges the four individuals named therein reside in Beijing, China and are members of the 54th Research Institute. The 54th Research Institute is a component of the People's Liberation Army. The indicted individuals gained unauthorized access, via a software vulnerability, to Equifax's internal network where they allegedly ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax's systems and obtained the names, birth dates, and social security numbers for approximately half of all adult American citizens. The defendants also took deliberate steps to evade detection in the system, including routing traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, using encrypted channels in order to blend in normal traffic within Equifax's network, and wiping log files on a daily basis to try to eliminate records of their activity.</p><p>DOJ, the FBI, and our partners will continue to work tirelessly to combat this threat posed by the Chinese government against our nation. Although the PRC continues to modify the ways in which it conducts nefarious cyber activity, including through working with criminal hackers, the cases prosecuted by the DOJ in partnership with the FBI reflect an increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute criminal conduct to the individuals and nation states involved. We will be relentless in our pursuit of such malicious activity against our citizens and our industry.</p><p>There are other risks. Chinese companies are increasingly acquiring or launching social media applications not housed in mainland China for the global consumer market. These applications generate big data and collect PII such as biometric information, contact lists, location data, log data, communication metadata, content (text and photographic), bank and credit card details, and financial transactions of U.S. persons. The associated user agreements and privacy policies typically obfuscate the companies' data handling responsibilities or directly state any and all data can be transferred to other locations and associated entities to include the Chinese parent company. These data handling policies create a risk for U.S. big data and PII to be targeted and exploited by PRC actors. More broadly, consumers should be aware of the privacy implications of any application they install, especially applications from foreign countries with weak data protection laws.</p><p>In June 2017, the PRC introduced a new national cyber security law that requires foreign firms to store data locally and submit to data surveillance measures. Although implementing regulations are still being drafted, Beijing could likely use these authorities and policies to compel access to U.S. commercial and sensitive personal data, including sensitive information stored or transmitted through Chinese systems. U.S.-based subsidiaries of Chinese corporations and entities, or organizations in the U.S. partnering on cooperative research and development efforts, are among the entities affected by this law. The law has raised fears by those concerned with Beijing's control of sensitive company information and increased opportunity to steal intellectual property.</p><p>Threats Exposing Vulnerabilities on Critical Infrastructure Networks and the Public</p><p>Virtually all companies collect and maintain sensitive data either of their own employees or customer information. The overall trend of digitizing data for ease of use or access makes many different industries vulnerable to data breaches. For instance, over recent years the healthcare industry has moved to centralizing patient data and using Internet-connected devices, which has increased the sector's potential attack surface. Cyber actors benefit from this target-rich environment as the passage of patient data between healthcare departments and networks is critical to their care, but often levels of cybersecurity vary. Ransomware, denial of service attacks, and data breaches can all impede the ability to provide basic patient care and privacy for protected health information (\"PHI\"). Electronic medical records typically contain PII, which, combined with medical record information, is known as PHI.</p><p>It is also highly likely cyber actors target the IT Sector to access their customers' data and networks. IT sector entities manage and store valuable customer data and have unique, privileged access to client networks. These vital services create an environment where IT sector networks are compromised as a means for malicious cyber actors to reach a final target for fraud, hacktivism, and counterintelligence purposes.</p><p>Entertainment and media companies use Internet-enabled systems for marketing, merchandising, ticketing, and reservations. As a result, owners and operators manage and protect databases of customer and employee data, including personal, financial, and credit card information. Since at least 2015, nation-state and criminal cyber actors have conducted computer network exploitation against the subsector likely to gain unauthorized access to non-public information, although the extent of the access in each case remains unclear.</p><p>Efforts Used to Combat, Prevent, and Investigate Hacking or the Misuse of this Data</p><p>In order to combat cyber threats, the FBI has taken a whole-of-society approach. We actively engage with our private sector partners through the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (\"NCFTA\"), which is a non-profit partnership between private industry, government and academia all working together to identify and disrupt cyber-crime. We recently hosted a ransomware-focused summit, with incident response companies, representatives from the legal and insurance industries as well as other government entities, where we discussed collaborative efforts to address the threats.</p><p>The FBI also partners with the National Defense Cyber Alliance (\"NDCA\"), which is a non-profit organization bringing together the U.S. Intelligence Community and Cleared Defense Contractor community to improve the security of their networks. Similar to how the NCFTA supports the financial/retail sector against criminal threats, the NDCA is designed to support the Defense Industrial Base against national security threats.</p><p>Through undercover operations and confidential human sources, we are targeting and shutting down dark-net and Clearnet criminal forums where identities are sold and where cyber-criminals gather to plan their next attack. We are actively engaging with our international partners through our Cyber Assistant Legal Attache (\"ALAT\") program, through our annual FBI-sponsored International Task Force and through our participation in the FBI-led International Cyber Crime Operations Summit (\"ICCOS\") as well as the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group (\"FELEG\") Cyber Crime Working Group.</p><p>The FBI understands the importance of stressing cybersecurity with individuals, not just with organizations. To do so, we hold a series of events aimed at educating and speaking with individuals about these issues. The FBI regularly takes part in Public Awareness Campaigns, where we coordinate with other agencies on initiatives for engagement with the private sector to prevent threats to critical infrastructure, educate entities on serious cyber threats, and ultimately close intelligence gaps. Additionally, we disseminate Private Industry Notifications (\"PINs\"), FBI Liaison Alert System (\"FLASH\") reports, and Public Service Announcements (\"PSAs\") to share cyber threat information with the private sector and the general public.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The FBI is engaged in myriad efforts to combat cyber threats, from improving threat identification and information sharing inside and outside of the government, to developing and retaining new talent, to examining the way we operate to disrupt and defeat these threats. FBI agents, analysts, and computer scientists are using technical capabilities and traditional investigative techniques -- such as sources, court-authorized electronic surveillance, physical surveillance, and forensics -- to counter these threats.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/wallace-testimonyanddownload=1\">https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/wallace-testimonyanddownload=1</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSC304034K9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBY-TN61-DYVR-P1YP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 4, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Automated Clearing House Risk Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUyMkVDQkI5NEM2NDc2QUEwRjAyMTEzMUQ2MkUzN0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0YzM0JGNzQ2OEE2NDk3OUFCMzM3MUU4QTYxNTEwNTY</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Funds Transfer Systems</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0MwMkRBRkZFNjhBNEI0OThBODlGN0Y3QzM0RUY1MDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzBDNzQyN0JENDRFNDYwMkEyNjVFRTgxNjNFRDExNUI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

For those who disagree, it is still true that China will remain partly reliant on foreign technology. Beijing is committed to state monopolies in strategic sectors, thus suppressing competition and innovation. China also needs foreign capital and has opened its financial sector to some extent as a draw. n1</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The basic choice for the US is weighing money earned by American technology companies against the harms of supporting the Chinese Communist Party. The US should enforce the rule of law, implement the export control guidelines already passed by Congress, and couple any technology restrictions with capital restrictions. The first step in effective action is documenting the multiple dimensions of the US-China technology relationship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology Relationship Facts</p><p>To protect American technology wisely, policy-makers need to understand the nature of the US-China technology relationship. Person to person exchanges are an important element and some American scientists misrepresent their ties to China, n2 muddying that picture. A complementary gap: there does not appear to be unclassified information on numbers of Chinese nationals working here specifically on technology projects. Those numbers, broken down by sectors and over time, are necessary to ascertain Chinese priorities and US vulnerability.</p><p>Services trade can partially represent person to person exchanges. The second-largest component of US services export to China, after travel, is use of American intellectual property (IP), which rose 12 percent to $8.5 billion in 2018 for the mainland plus a 50-percent jump for Hong Kong to $4.7 billion. n3 Very little of this was exports to foreign affiliates of US parents - it's all going to locals. But the numbers include IP with no advanced technology. Information services exports in particular were less than $1 billion to the mainland and smaller for Hong Kong.</p><p>Goods exports are more precisely defined. American semiconductor and related equipment exports to China climbed 22 percent to a record $9.8 billion in 2019, n4 despite a 12-percent decline in total exports to China. Chip exports to Hong Kong fell 11 percent but added another $4.7 billion. The combined total is also a record. In the past, rising American semiconductor exports were simply part of rising overall exports, but last year chips stood out.</p><p>American direct investment in China can also carry with it advanced technology. Through the first three quarters of 2019, direct investment in mainland China fell 15 percent from the first three quarters of 2018, to $4.6 billion. n5 Direct investment in Hong Kong fell 37 percent to $3.9 billion. At the end of 2018, cumulative American investment in computers and electronic products in China stood at $10.7 billion and had outpaced overall spending. Investment in Hong Kong computers and electronic products was steady at $2.5 billion at the end of 2018.</p><p>American portfolio (securities) investment can help fund Chinese technology programs. In November 2019, the cumulative position stood at $209 billion, 95 percent in corporate stocks. n6 This was a 20-percent increase over the position in November 2018. The figures for Hong Kong are a 5-percent gain to $171 billion, almost all stocks.</p><p>Chinese portfolio investment in the US can be an attempt to acquire technology indirectly, by becoming financially influential in targeted American firms. That spending stood at $1.54 trillion at the end of June 2019, down 4 percent from June 2018. n7 The large majority, though, was held in Treasury bonds. Holdings of American equities were $190 billion, down 12 percent.</p><p>Chinese direct investment can also be an effort to acquire technology. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reports combined Chinese and Hong Kong direct investment at $2.7 billion in the first three quarters of 2019, 50 percent more than the same period of 2018. n8 BEA claims net investment in computer and electronic products was negligible through 2018. The American Enterprise Institute's China Global Investment Tracker is not limited to advanced technology and has the stock of technology investment at better than $20 billion through 2019. However, there has been very little fresh investment since 2016 and even some of that is being rolled back. n9</p><p>A last category is less conventional than trade and investment but vital in US-China relations: earnings of US affiliates in China. Data are only complete through 2017, prior to the bilateral trade conflict. American majority-owned affiliates in China reported sales of $376 billion in 2017, $86 billion of this in computers and electronic products. n10 Minority-owned affiliates had almost no sales in computers and electronic products. Majority-owned affiliates in computers and electronic products reported $3.6 billion in 2017 capital expenditure in China.</p><p>China's Motives</p><p>US technology firms' willingness to comply with even abusive Chinese policies may be best explained just by those 2017 sales in striking distance of $100 billion. And it can be much starker for individual firms. Lists of companies most dependent on the Chinese market are dominated by technology, featuring Qualcomm, Micron, Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices and others receiving 30 percent or more of annual revenue from China in one form or another. The forecast is for more: while Beijing massages all its economic statistics, technology consistently outperforms other sectors. One tailored measurement says technology revenue exceeded $1 trillion in 2019, growing far faster than official GDP. n11</p><p>.....................Technology Relationship Snapshot</p><p>Indicator .....................Main result ...............Year</p><p>Royalties for US IP in China ...............+12% to $8.5 billion ............2018</p><p>US semiconductor and related exports to China .........+22% to $9.8 billion ............2019</p><p>US investment in computers and electronics in China ......$10.7 billion (cumulative) .........Thru 2018</p><p>US holdings of Chinese securities ............+20 % to $209 billion ............Thru November 2019</p><p>Chinese holdings of US stocks ...............-12% to $190 billion ............Thru June 2019</p><p>Chinese direct investment in US technology, all types ......$21.8 billion (cumulative) .........Thru 2019</p><p>US majority affiliate sales of electronics products in China ...$86 billion ...............2017</p><p>Sources: see footnotes 1-9.</p><p>In contrast, the motivation for China to engage American firms is multi-dimensional. Acquiring advanced technology is obvious but understates the situation. The Chinese economy is slowing, it has run up enormous debt, and its population is aging. In 2010, official GDP growth was said to be 10.6 percent, in 2019 it was 6.1 percent and most likely slower. While many observers cannot imagine Chinese GDP growth below 2 percent within a decade, that is a simple trend.</p><p>It's also a sophisticated trend. The World Bank says gross fixed capital formation - investment that actually contributes to GDP - stood at $5.7 trillion in 2018. Yet China reported its benchmark measure of investment at $9.4 trillion. n12 Not all of that difference is outright wasted, but a fair chunk is. This is confirmed by the Bank of International Settlements, which has outstanding credit as a share of GDP rising more than 100 percentage points from the start of the global financial crisis to the third quarter of 2019. The equivalent American rise is 20 points (despite a recent surge in the US federal deficit). n13 China is borrowing more, to grow slower.</p><p>Its demographics are also deteriorating. Median age is estimated at over 38 for 2020, headed to 47 by 2045. n14 The latter is approximately Japan's median now. US median age is very similar to China's today but will be a full five years younger in 2045. The Communist Party is well aware of debt and aging and frequently cites innovation as the key to avoid stagnation. But the Party is intolerant of competition, reserving perhaps two dozen sectors to state monopoly. Firms which do not have to compete have much less reason to innovate and in fact state-owned enterprises are less innovative. n15 In those sectors, China will continue to rely on foreign technology.</p><p>This reliance is not Beijing's only motive, though. Much attention has been paid to China's edge in \"big data\" - population size is said to bolster firms who can gather information on consumer behavior. While this is true with regard to competition within China, distortions in the home market make Chinese data considerably less valuable to competition overseas. This is one motive for firms such as Alibaba to gather foreign data through the Belt and Road and an additional motive for China to solicit American firms that hold large quantities of consumer data.</p><p>A third motive is financial. American technology firms make money in China, and China makes money from American firms' technology. It's difficult to measure all the ways in which foreign technology is lucrative but China's $1-trillion home market is suggestive. Especially valuable is foreign exchange, which funds the Belt and Road and possible acquisitions of more foreign technology. In some years, the single biggest contributor to Beijing's foreign reserves has been telecom equipment exports to the US, which passed $80 billion annually before falling back in 2019. n16 The Party's ideal is to use the proceeds to fund China's own technology development.</p><p>Policy responses</p><p>The US government should act only rarely when the aim is profitability - that is a matter for the private sector. Many complaints by American technology companies about China concern barriers to profitability and it is not a core government responsibility to help already prospering firms do still better. Government intervention in this case is primarily about when to sacrifice profitability for the sake of broader national interests, There are multiple issues that require setting aside some private sector goals.</p><p>1) The rule of law is often skipped over or assumed, but should not be when China is involved. Huawei is now under federal indictment for both racketeering and theft of trade secrets, yet the administration continues to hand out temporary general licenses for the sake of American firms gaining from Huawei business. Chinese firms have for years ignored disclosure requirements for listing on US stock exchanges, yet calls for delisting are resisted on the basis of wildly exaggerating the cost. n17 If our existing laws and regulations are not enforced properly, creating new policies is mere posturing.</p><p>2) The Department of Commerce's Entity List effectively encourages offshoring by restricting only US-based exports. Commerce's proposed (in December) implementation of a May 2019 executive order on supply chain security is vague n18 and could be altered at any time, both of these features increasing uncertainty for little reason evident to date. Congress passed new export control guidelines in summer 2018 on a bipartisan basis. In the 20 months since, draft regulations have been issued for one technology. The most important step in changing the US-China technology relationship is implementing Congressionally-mandated changes to export controls.</p><p>3) While capital flows are not typically seen as vital for national security, capital is a partial substitute for technology. Whatever the level of technological restriction - from minimal to sweeping -- capital restriction must reinforce it. It would be self-defeating for the US to block transfer of a technology yet permit unrestricted investment in China's efforts to develop it locally. Because China can raise money from other rich countries, the US must pressure friends and allies not to provide capital to firms or programs chasing restricted technology. This will require a clear and consistent American rationale, and possibly a clear and consistent threat. n19</p><p>4) The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has been the first line of defense for advanced technology. However, the low volume of recent Chinese investment means CFIUS should focus at present on identifying patterns in small transactions. Mitigation may not be required but these cases help identify China's tactics and priorities, improving policy-making.</p><p>A particular recommendation: approval of initial investment should not create presumption of approval for additional investment, to guard against the tactic of a first, innocent foot in the door.</p><p>In any action along these lines, the US should deemphasize individual Chinese companies. For the economic reasons outlined above, as well as socio-political reasons, the Communist Party works hard to dictate technology development. The goal is to benefit Chinese technology firms only as part of benefiting the Party. It's the Party that orders large-scale programs and subsidies at home and acquisitions and theft overseas. It's the Party that coerces The US should not focus on a few Chinese enterprises but instead think in terms of whole supply chains and industries.</p><p>n1 KPMG, \"Accelerated Opening Up of China's Financial Sector,\" July 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/cn/pdf/en/2019/07/accelerated-opening-up-of-china-s-financial-sector.pdf\">https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/cn/pdf/en/2019/07/accelerated-opening-up-of-china-s-financial-sector.pdf</url>.</p><p>n2 Ellen Barry and Gina Kolata, \"China's Lavish Funds Lured U.S. Scientists.

I have worked as an analyst of Chinese cyber and technology policies for the last decade, in the U.S. national security community and in the private sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My previous testimonies before other House and Senate committees over the past two years addressed broader challenges in the U.S.-China technology relationship, providing recommendations on issues such as export controls, market access in China, and the ethical challenges of joint research in emerging technologies. n1 In each of these areas, I argued that it is absolutely vital that we maintain the openness of the U.S. system, but with greater resilience and new guardrails to ensure that openness is not exploited.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today I will provide remarks on managing the data security risks of U.S.-China technology entanglement. I will focus on three areas:</p><p>(1) The reality of China's cyber governance system and how Chinese government access to data works in practice</p><p>(2) How to build a stronger U.S. cybersecurity and data privacy system</p><p>(3) How to address risks posed by China in a way that strengthens U.S. global technological leadership and competitiveness</p><p>Part I. China's cyber governance system and Chinese government access to data</p><p>We need to start with an accurate understanding of the nature of the risks posed by China's cyber governance system.</p><p>Here I would like to make two points:</p><p>1. U.S. policymakers should not conflate the problems of (a) U.S. companies operating inside China with (b) Chinese companies operating in the United States.</p><p>Different policy approaches are required to address two separate sets of risks. The first is U.S. companies like Apple operating in China (mainly handling Chinese citizen data) and the second is Chinese companies like TikTok operating in the United States (mainly handling U.S. citizen data). Because U.S. firms in China manage mostly Chinese citizen data, this poses serious ethical and market access questions. This is distinct from the national security question of Chinese companies having access to massive amounts of U.S. citizen data overseas.</p><p>The data handled by U.S. firms operating in China is primarily Chinese citizen data, and in some cases, they segment their global networks to prevent Chinese citizen data from flowing outside of China, in accordance with Chinese law. The challenges for U.S. firms in this context are ethical: how will they respond to pressure from the Chinese government to turn over the content of user emails or search histories to crack down on dissent? Do they have control over and visibility into supply chains to prevent the company's technology from enabling the Chinese government to commit mass human rights violations today or in the future? The mass incarceration of minorities in areas like Xinjiang or Tibet is just one example. A new report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute describes Uighurs in prison-like forced labor conditions at Chinese factories reported to supply U.S. companies such as Nike. n2</p><p>In my previous testimonies, I argued for the development of new legislation and standards to systematically consider the ethics of specific partnerships in China. This is too big and complex a challenge for individual companies to take on themselves. Existing voluntary guidelines like the Global Network Initiative (GNI) are not up to the task of addressing the problem. n3 But neither of the two extreme positions I often hear--pretending these issues do not exist at all or pushing to sever all research and commercial ties with China--serve U.S. interests and values, either.</p><p>U.S. firms also face market access barriers and costs due to Chinese government restrictions around cross border transfer of data. Article 37 of China's Cybersecurity Law requires that certain kinds of data (\"important data\" and \"personal data\") must be stored on local servers or undergo a security assessment before being sent outside of China. There still appears to be a regulatory gray zone in which multinationals in China can send certain kinds of data outside the country, but it is not clear the extent to which this will be the case in the future, given the significant weight given to national security in Beijing's approach to data regulation.</p><p>This is a separate question from the other key issue: the way Chinese companies handle U.S. citizen data does impact U.S. national security. This could mean a Chinese app collecting data from overseas users (like TikTok) or a Chinese company seeking to acquire a U.S. company that has data collected on Americas (like the Ant Financial/Moneygram deal blocked by CFIUS).</p><p>This brings me to my second point:</p><p>2. The Chinese government does not necessarily have unfettered real-time access to all companies' data.</p><p>The government of Xi Jinping has built the most comprehensive cyber governance framework in the world. With the 2017 Cybersecurity Law as the centerpiece, a sprawling framework governs data security and transfer, critical infrastructure, and digital content. This framework underpins the most sophisticated system for online control in the world, which the Chinese government is now using to monitor and restrict population movement in the wake of the Coronavirus. n4 And on March 1, a new sweeping regulation for censoring content took effect. n5</p><p>U.S. and Chinese firms must comply with these requirements to operate in China. But what exactly does compliance mean in practice? Nothing is black and white, particularly when it comes to government access to data. Ultimately the Chinese government can compel companies to turn over their data, but this does not always happen.</p><p>U.S. policymakers must start with a fact-based understanding of the reality on the ground, taking into account the internal push and pull of different actors in the system, and the gray zones in the rules. Chinese corporate actors are not synonymous with the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and have their own commercial interests to protect. Failure to take into account the friction within the system can lead to dangerous policy outcomes; decoupling and conflict with China are not in the interest of U.S. security or economic prosperity.</p><p>Many Chinese companies will say privately that they routinely push back against data requests from the government, but they do not want to talk publicly about the fact that they do often resist because doing so draws attention to themselves. In fact, drawing attention to themselves would be counterproductive to the ultimate goal of fighting against government intrusion. In China, media attention will only lead government officials to double down on their request.</p><p>A few examples have come out publicly. The Chinese ride-sharing company Didi initially refused to turn over data to law enforcement authorities investigating the murder of passengers. n6 Tencent and Alibaba refused to feed their transaction data to a government credit reporting program under the People's Bank of China (PBoC). n7 The Chinese app WeChat states that it does not store the content of user chats for data mining, which may be driven in part to avoid entanglement with the government, according to an article in the Harvard Business Review. n8</p><p>It is also important to keep in mind that data requests are made in a manual fashion (request, review, respond). Moreover, there is no single government repository of all data. The PboC and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the state agency responsible for state economic planning, have a history of not sharing data with each other. This is not surprising given the tremendous political power that certain kinds of data can yield in the Chinese system.</p><p>I'd like to walk through how the regulatory regime related to government access to data in China works since the system is very difficult for outsiders to understand in English, let alone by reading the original directives in Chinese. Moreover, many commentators in the U.S. have no experience with the process involved for companies undergoing cybersecurity-related audits in China.</p><p>Among the concerning parts of this cyber governance framework, the Cybersecurity Law (Article 28) states that \"Network operators shall provide technical support and assistance to public security organs and national security organs that are safeguarding national security and investigating criminal activities in accordance with the law.\" n9 This vague language (which also is echoed in the 2015 Counterterrorism Law n10 and National Security Law n11) does provide an opening for the government to compel companies to collaborate with intelligence services and law enforcement. Does \"technical support\" mean turning over encryption keys? Does it mean data monitoring by the security services? Maybe, maybe not.</p><p>Compliance often involves lengthy and complicated negotiations between companies and local officials. Local officials must balance competing demands of security with immense pressure to deliver economic development in their jurisdiction. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) derives its ruling authority in large part by providing economic prosperity. Furthermore, different local government agencies often have different objectives. Sometimes companies will leverage connections with officials from other agencies to stop security bureau officials from seeking certain kinds of data. n12 These factors creates a kind of backstop on how far the government tends to go in implementing some of the most worrisome provisions of China's cyber governance regime.</p><p>I'd like to look at recent developments in China's cyber governance system where risk of data access is at issue: a regulatory scheme called the Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS) and the Cryptography Law. Both apply to Chinese and U.S. firms in China.</p><p>(a) Multi-Level Protection Scheme 2.0 (MLPS 2.0)</p><p>MLPS is a security certification regime that the Chinese government established in 2007. In 2018, China's Ministry of Public Security (MPS) released a draft of a new version (referred to as MLPS 2.0). The draft regulation updates the original MLPS regime based on the new principles set out in the 2017 Cybersecurity Law. MLPS ranks from 1 to 5 all information and communications technology (ICT) systems based on their importance to national security, with Level 5 deemed the most sensitive. Anything ranked level 3 or above triggers a suite of regulatory requirements. Companies initiate the process by conducting a self-assessment and working with a third party auditor (typically linked with the local public security bureaus); the auditor conducts interviews on site and observes testing and verification performed by the company. The auditor then writes a report for the provincial or city-level public security bureau.</p><p>To be sure, MLPS 2.0 creates more regulatory scrutiny on foreign technology, along with a host of new market access barriers as the Xi government doubles down on reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and boosting indigenous equipment. While the 2007 version of MLPS only targets information systems controlled by the government, the updated regime covers all information systems (all \"network operators\"), meaning that all private and foreign companies now fall in scope of the review. In the current environment MLPS 2.0 also appears to have a focus on cloud computing, big data platforms, and the Internet of Things.</p><p>While this creates a ton of regulatory headache, there is nothing written down under MLPS that requires firms to provide access to all of their data (or provide encryption keys to the Chinese government). There is a provision that requires information systems graded level 3 and above to undergo \"cybersecurity monitoring\" connected to the public security agency. But there is no definition of what exactly this entails--does this mean a sleepy security guard sits in a facility or a device is installed in the network? The audit is a negotiation--a give and take in which companies hash out with regulators a way to be compliant but not go as far as the most conservative interpretation of the requirements. Again, local bureaus responsible for economic growth in their jurisdiction do not have incentives to demand that companies turn over all of their data. Chinese government regulators understand that certain MLPS requirements like the use of Chinese domestic encryption (as discussed in the next section) create tremendous costs and challenges for foreign companies, which means the use of domestic encryption by foreign firms is rarely enforced.</p><p>(It is important to note that the final regulation for MLPS 2.0 has not yet been released. The latest development in late 2019 is that the core standard of MLPS took effect (spelling out the requirements for each of the five levels of the graded system).)</p><p>(b) New Cryptography Law</p><p>The two most important things to understand about China's encryption regime are (1) the Chinese government wants all companies to use Chinese encryption algorithms; and (2) the vast majority of foreign companies do not do this and regulators rarely enforce it.</p><p>The problem, however, is it is not clear whether this will be the case in the future.</p><p>A major change is underway with the release of the Cryptography Law (which entered force January 1 2020). This law overhauled China's encryption regime after two decades of intense internal debate. The law is concerning on several fronts, but it is too early to determine the impact it will have as we are awaiting follow-on regulations that will offer more details about its scope and how it will be implemented for companies. (New regulations plus standards tied to those will eventually update a 1999 regulation called the Regulation on the Administration of Commercial Cipher Codes.)</p><p>This new law introduces two important changes, among other developments:</p><p>First, it eliminates a significant carve out that has benefitted foreign companies for years. Under the previous regime (centered on the 1999 Regulation on the Administration of Commercial Cipher Codes), the government granted what is known as the \"core function exception.\" This meant that the government permitted the use of products designed with encryption as a general feature (e.g., commercial software). In contrast, products designed to be encryption or security products as their \"core\" function would face restriction. So companies like Symantec and encryption hardware manufacturers, for example, were excluded from the Chinese market, leaving domestic firms to dominate these business segments. However, for the past two decades, many companies have benefited from carve out, including server, database, and software companies considered not to have encryption as their core function.</p><p>The new law is a potential game changer by removing this exception. It is still too early to know whether this means products allowed under the previous regime could be restricted or if they will still be allowed albeit with a new approval process. Nobody knows yet. In place of the exception, the government has indicated that it will focus on requiring certifications for the fifteen products listed in the \"Catalogue of Critical Network Equipment and Network Security-Specific Products\" (\"The Catalogue\" includes items like routers, switches, PLC equipment). This Catalogue came out with the Cybersecurity Law in 2017 and lists network products that must receive a certification before they can enter the market. n13 It is also possible that the new regime could create some new openings for foreign companies, especially smaller companies.</p><p>The second change is that the new law creates a separate category of what is called \"commercial encryption\" (distinct from \"core\" and \"common encryption,\" which both apply to state secrets; \"core\" being the most sensitive). Any item that is identified as a commercial encryption \"mass consumption product\" will not be subject to an import license. The government has not yet released regulations to clarify the scope of \"mass consumption,\" again creating much uncertainty. Depending on how it is implemented, this could mean lifting the burden of having to navigate a lengthy administrative review process (which is often subject to rent-seeking).</p><p>Is operating in a regulatory gray zone--one in which the government has all the power and can change course at any moment--a wise decision for a U.S. company? That is not my area of expertise. I highlight these ambiguities so that U.S. policymakers have an accurate picture of how the process works.</p><p>Part 2. Recommendations</p><p>This first part of my testimony makes clear that China poses real cyber risks to the United States (ethical, commercial, and national security). If the Chinese government wants something, then they can get it, so why is it even important to understand the nuance of how the process works in China, and the fact that there is an internal push and pull, driven by stakeholders with often conflicting agendas? It's easy to make claims that drive headlines on this issue, but my observations are different and can be more difficult to make into short sound bites. I believe U.S. policymakers must have an accurate understanding of the complexities in China's system so that we can respond to the risks it poses in the most responsible and effective manner.</p><p>Here I have two main recommendation for how to do this.</p><p>(2.1) Build a better U.S. cybersecurity and data privacy system</p><p>In order to address the risks presented by Beijing, we should not be reactive, but actively seek to set out a different vision for U.S. internet governance based on a rule of law system.</p><p>The reason why in China there is no guarantee that the Chinese government cannot access data is because China's system lacks clarity of law, oversight mechanisms, and clear pathways for contestation. As U.S. policymakers look to strengthen our own data privacy and cybersecurity system, there are important lessons we can learn. Establishing clear authorities and oversight capacity enables the U.S. government to conduct legitimate national security and law enforcement investigations in such a way that upholds civil liberties and is subject to review and appeal. Here the United States has an opportunity to set out a different vision for U.S. internet governance, one that strikes the appropriate balances among national security, economic, and privacy concerns in a way that promotes strong democratic norms and protects data flow openness.</p><p>The United States would be wise to spend more time working on legislation and the development of standards to better protect privacy and secure data--not just in dealing with China--but for all companies. n14 Lawmakers should accelerate progress on a number of bills addressing algorithmic transparency, strengthening cybersecurity, and mandating higher standards for personal data. Developing a comprehensive federal privacy bill is vital to this effort, along with the creation of strong enforcement mechanisms. Inaction by the United States means ceding leadership and influence to both Europe and China in setting international standards.</p><p>Moreover, without higher standards for data security and privacy, U.S. citizen data held by unregulated private companies will be more vulnerable to breaches by hackers from China. Equifax's many security issues are well-documented, such as the company's failure to patch known vulnerabilities that ultimately left exposed the data of 145 million Americans. But the hack was also conducted by a foreign government entity with sophisticated hacking capabilities and access to considerable state resources. Setting minimum standards on what data can be collected and retained by all companies will help protect U.S. personal data, regardless of whether the risk is exacerbated by a state-sponsored hacker, a data broker, or a private company transferring the data to Beijing. Companies should not even have access to so much personal data in the first place that can be hacked or transmitted back to Beijing.</p><p>(2.2) How to address cyber risk from China in a way that strengthens global U.S. technological leadership and competitiveness</p><p>We must keep in mind that U.S. actions to respond to data security risks posed by the Chinese government are not occurring in a vacuum. Our policy approach should be tailored to take into account the fact that technology competition with China will not only play out in the United States and China, but also in other places from India to Europe. How we respond to Chinese companies operating in the United States will have ramifications for whether other countries are willing to accept our vision of data governance.</p><p>The ability of U.S. firms to maintain a high rate of innovation depends upon access to global markets, talent, and, perhaps most important, datasets. But an increasingly obstacle to the ability of U.S. companies to operate internationally--beyond China--is rising data sovereignty in places from Europe to India and Vietnam. Data sovereignty refers to efforts by nation-states to ensure control over data by prohibiting transfers of data out of the country or seeking to limit foreign access to certain kinds of data. n15 In this context, our actions will serve as a reference and a roadmap for other governments that are concerned about U.S. companies and the U.S. government getting access their data.</p><p>For example, Indian lawmakers are in the middle of debating a draft data protection bill that would require local storage and processing of Indian citizen data in an effort to boost local technology firms as well as push back against data collection by large U.S. companies. n16 The U.S. government and U.S. industry have lobbied against this law. In this context, the U.S. establishing (or, arguably, contributing to) a precedent of strict data localization rules risks other countries following suit.</p><p>If U.S. firms cannot send data out of countries in which they operate overseas, they lose access to the value of being able to create international data sets. This directly impacts economic growth and AI innovation because of the ways large, diverse, international datasets are core to building artificial intelligence applications that work across a variety of different geographies, languages, cultures, and demographics. A language translation system only trained in China, for instance, will likely not accurately and precisely capture all of the world's spoken languages as much as a language translation system with data from many different countries. Skin cancer predictors trained only on lighter skin tones, to give another example, are likely to have poor accuracy and precision when trying to predict skin cancer with darker skin tones. Policies that leave companies without any access to global datasets under any circumstances will lead to a \"fracturing\" of how AI applications are developed.</p><p>We have an opportunity to set the standards for protecting the flow of data that has underpinned economic growth and the free flow of information around the world, but with the right safeguards in place.</p><p>The challenge, therefore, is how to maintain this openness but with the right guardrails in place. The first step is to limit companies' access and retention of data across the board, as discussed earlier.</p><p>We also need to take a targeted approach to restrictions on Chinese companies. In my previous testimonies I argued for an approach based on the idea of a \"small yard, high fence,\" borrowing a phrase used by former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to mean be selective about what we protect, yet aggressive in protecting it. The same idea should apply to restrictions on access to U.S. citizen data.</p><p>The expanded powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) n17 provides one tool to do this. The U.S. government should evaluate the risks when a foreign firm acquires or takes a non-controlling investment stake in an American firm that holds U.S. citizen data. As my Yale colleague Rob Williams writes, CFIUS uses a case-by-case approach to evaluate risk, best understood as a scalpel and not a sledge hammer. n18</p><p>Whether through CFIUS or other policy tools, any new restrictions must take a risk-based approach. Not all data has the same level of sensitivity. The mere fact that a Chinese company handles U.S. citizen data in and of itself may not necessarily warrant banning a transaction or blacklisting a specific company. The U.S. national security risks should be evaluated based on an investigation (with regular audits) to determine (a) what kind of U.S. citizen data is being accessed (e.g., metadata, images, geographic data, critical infrastructure data, etc.), (b) how that data is being used and what data protection measures are in place to protect the rights and interests of U.S. consumers, and (c) with whom that data is being shared and through what mechanisms. If based on the outcomes of such an evaluation, we cannot verify that the interests and rights of U.S. consumers will be protected, then that company should be prohibited from storing and sharing U.S. personal data.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In short, we need a more effective strategy to protect U.S. personal data than one-off bans on companies or where they send their data. We need to address legitimate national security risks where they exist but as one part of a broader U.S. initiative on comprehensive data privacy and higher standards for cybersecurity for all companies (whether U.S. or foreign). These efforts should not name China as a bad actor, but instead create a high bar for how all companies manage their data. Failure to establish a compelling vision for U.S. internet governance will only allow more space around the world for companies controlled by the CCP to flourish worldwide, and Beijing's vision for the internet with it.</p><p>n1 Samm Sacks, Testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, May 2019), <url

Key Observations and Assessments n2</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chairman Hawley, Ranking Member Whitehouse, distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss a topic of critical importance to the United States. I want to begin with a few observations:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1) Americans face systemic ikwhen using platforms operating in or owned by companies in countries with a history of cyber espionage, forced tech transfer, and a lack of rule of law.</p><p>Without the same system of checks and balances against misuse we have in the United States, U.S. citizens are at high risk for data exploitation via these platforms. In addition to an established precedent of IP theft and espionage against the United States, private Chinese technology companies' ability to resist the Chinese government is highly circumscribed at best. This is due in part to the Chinese government's deliberate blending of the public and private digital landscape through Article Seven of China's 2017 National Intelligence Law, where Chinese organizations and citizens are compelled to cooperate with \"state intelligence work.\" n3 China's much-examined 2017 Cybersecurity Law and subsequent updates also bolster this tactic. n4 As public policy researchers noted last year, these laws \"[entail] strict provisions requiring data to be housed inside China, as well as spot inspections and even black-box security audits.\" n5 If a company stores U.S. data overseas, that data may be subject to similar foreign legislation. \"Country-agnostic\" approaches (or, relatedly, vendor-neutral approaches to building out critical infrastructure like next generation wireless technology)--while rhetorically expedient--do not strike at the heart of these systemic issues. n6</p><p>Further, American lawmakers and citizens possess even less insight into the data security practices of foreign-owned technology companies than they do businesses in the United States. The lack of granularity provided on real-time data collection, levels of access, storage, server locations, and third-party partnerships present a national security risk. In the case of TikTok, David Carroll, writing in Quartz in May 2019, asserted that an earlier version of TikTok's privacy policy allowed data on the app to be shared with \"with any member or affiliate of [its] group\" in China before the policy's revision in February 2019. n7 While TikTok claims to store its data in the United States as of today, its Beijing-headquartered parent company, ByteDance, is subject to the Chinese legislation noted above. In addition to this legislation, technical vulnerabilities in systems built and owned by Chinese companies abound. These can include much-discussed \"backdoors\" in code that would allow the Chinese government access to third party systems and security flaws hidden in a programming vulnerability, or \"bugdoors\"--flaws could even be introduced later via a software update. n8</p><p>2) China is exporting its values embedded in the technology itself and legal frameworks to the world. Leaked documents from TikTok indicate the company censors content on Tiananmen Square and Tibetan independence, and possibly reporting on the Hong Kong protests and the imprisonment of approximately 1 million Uighurs in Xinjiang detention camps. n9 Not only China exporting technology, particularly Al-related surveillance tech, but the Chinese \"party-state\" is also transmitting the laws and policies that govern its use. For instance, Vietnamese officials were trained in and attempted to implement a cybersecurity law modeled after China's version of the legislation in 2018. This draft law contained strict data storage provisions (which gives access to a government \"task force\"), a mandate to open offices in Vietnam if requested by Vietnam's Public Security Ministry, and overarching definitions of content. It is also expanding that access through its legislation: China's full \"internet security plan,\" encompassing a soon-to-be-implemented 2020 Foreign Investment Law, will no longer render foreign-owned companies in China exempt from the Cybersecurity Law. n10 Effectively, any data on communications networks in China will be soon be subject to the Chinese Cybersecurity Bureau's scrutiny, without requiring an official request. This ability to access more data from more sources lays the groundwork for its exploitation. n11</p><p>3) Private companies play an outsized role in this environment due to their sustained and unfettered access to a high volume and variety of personal data--behavioral and biometric-- with high commercial value. A May 2019 survey indicated almost half (46%) of 18-24 year olds accept tech privacy agreements without reading a single word. n12 This bargain has led to private tech companies' often overwhelming access to consumer data, such as when IBM scraped millions of photos from unwitting citizens using photo hosting site Flikr at the beginning of this year. n13</p><p>4) The digital environment is growing more complex. The strategic intent of bad actors is increasingly difficult to delineate, and emerging technologies are exacerbating existing threats. Emerging technologies, particularly machine learning, will give malign actors the ability to turn data into insights. In addition, the strategic intent of nation-state actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists is increasingly intertwined, heightening the chaotic nature of the landscape. Protecting the United States against these supercharged threats from various attack vectors will only get harder.</p><p>5) Solutions are overdue. If democratic societies do not establish the rules of the road for data security and privacy protections, authoritarians will do it for us. By next year alone, approximately 30 billion devices will be connected to the internet, and by 2025, almost five billion people will have access to the web. n14 This amounts to a huge attack surface for cybercriminals, adversarial nation-states, and other bad actors to both wreak havoc and set their own standards.</p><p>II. Recommendations n15</p><p>The advent of the internet and social media promised to wrench control of information from the hands of a few and distribute it to the many, to air marginalized perspectives, to elevate new views in a meritocracy of ideas, and even to propagate a more open society. Decentralized applications and low barriers to entry across the digital space acted as great levelers. Yet, increasingly, that vision is under threat. As China attempts to impart its authoritarian values on the United States, private industry and the U.S. government must develop a set of solutions to push back.</p><p>1) Congress should mandate interagency import reviews of information and communications technologies against a criteria that encompasses the likelihood of systemic risk (e.g. lack of the sufficient rule of law protections, a free press, an independent judiciary, and recourse against government demands for private data, etc). This criteria should serve to exclude untrusted private sector vendors and governments from collecting U.S. data on the basis of a series of risk factors or key indicators. The State Department's September 2019 draft guidance for the export of hardware, software, and technology with surveillance capabilities is a good start point. n16 The DoS document's due diligence and red flag considerations can be extended to include the following key criteria: Data aggregation with established intent of political or social control; Significant surveillance technology investments abroad; Significant evidence of government subsidizing private industry; A track record of exporting to regimes consistently ranked low on Freedom House, World Bank, etc, rankings or those found to have committed gross violations of human rights as defined in FAA 1961.</p><p>2) Lawmakers should enshrine data protections and incentivize transparency within the government and the private sector. For the government, that means maintaining transparency by keeping the public informed on how their personal information is being used and protected. Clear policies and limits should be articulated around data retention, such as limited tolerance for storing data indefinitely. Classify biometric data as \"sensitive data\" and enshrine protections around this data, including limited interoperability with other commercial and government systems. In accordance with NIST guidelines, any identity management systems must be secure and reliable, based off proper standards and measurement. n17 Enforce data protection inspections and oversight among agreed-upon parties. n18 Congress should also explore a national data protection framework as \"baseline privacy protections.\" n19 Private companies should invest a substantial portion of engineering capacity to developing technical privacy solutions, such as protecting biometric data on the back end. They can also further explore new ways to create systems that promote user control of data by examining new navigation protocols. n20</p><p>3) Tech companies should adopt a set of rules, norms, and guiding principles for the use of their tech globally (and for interfacing with authoritarian regimes) that won't tip the scale in favor of repression. Given this systemic risk and contest, American private companies should treat U.S. national security as a strategic imperative and provide regular updates on the guardrails that implement to Congress. If deficient, the Magnitsky Act and Commerce Department Entity listings provide enforcement mechanisms for the abuse of this technology by individual and corporate actors.</p><p>4) Frontload investment in securing digital infrastructure from the outset. Critical U.S. infrastructure is vulnerable to IP theft, weakened data privacy, hacking, and other disruptions of the digital systems Americans take for granted. The U.S. government can stay competitive by prizing network and data security against nation-states and other actors with a track record of attacking U.S. systems. n21</p><p>I look forward to taking your questions.</p><p>n1 In addition to new material, this testimony includes original content from the witness's previously published work and media commentary.</p><p>n2 A portion of these observations are derived or pulled directly from a paper written exclusively by the witness and dated October 2019, \"Reclaiming Cyber Governance as a Bulwark Against--and Not a Tool of--Illiberalism\" for the U.S. government's Congressionally-mandated Cyber Solarium Commission.

Threats to personal data and critical infrastructure remain one of the most important risks facing our nation. Our reliance on digital infrastructure and services has made us vulnerable to attacks by nation-state adversaries and their proxies, and a largely consequence-free environment for malicious cyber activity has given rise to a bustling cybercrime ecosystem trading on the private data of American consumers and businesses. At the same time, the lack of American leadership on key issues like data governance and digital law enforcement has led to the proliferation of counterproductive policies around the world as foreign governments seek to exercise their sovereignty over technology and data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The cyber domain continues to evolve around us. In the last 50 years, the price of computing power and data storage has dropped by 6-8 orders of magnitude, n1 and the amount of digital data has grown proportionally. The exponential growth of the attack surface as more of our lives move online and connected devices proliferate (the so-called Internet of things (IoT)) has created new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors.</p><p>The threat landscape is also evolving. Offensive cyber capabilities have become a must-have in the arsenals of even the smallest national governments. The development of a complex and mature criminal economy online has transformed cybercrime, increasing the sophistication of major criminal groups and making it easy and cheap for unsophisticated small-time cyber criminals to commit fraud and extortion at scale. And repressive governments increasingly leverage technology and data to conduct surveillance, marginalize and exclude groups, and crush dissent and control information.</p><p>Norms of state behavior in cyberspace have been adopted in a wide range of international forums, including the United Nations, but the lack of a common lexicon and agreed interpretations of international law have hampered compliance and enforcement. Despite years of investment in tools and expertise, law enforcement's capacity to investigate and prosecute cybercrimes remains limited, and cybercrime is largely consequence-free. And while the NIST Framework and international standards for cybersecurity have helped to spread basic awareness of and promote investment in cybersecurity, particularly for critical infrastructure operators, a lack of clear incentives has left significant gaps in our national cyber readiness that can be exploited by a wide range of malicious actors.</p><p>Finally, around the world, the lack of US Government (USG) leadership on key issues of data governance has led to the proliferation of counterproductive policies that harm US businesses and create new risks to private data. The status quo is unsustainable for many governments, and a result they are implementing policies like data localization, data retention mandates, and restrictions on encryption that harm innovation and competition and expose sensitive data to abuse. The USG must take steps to enable appropriate and lawful access to data for governments around the world to push back on the rising tide of counterproductive policies to preserve that access in ways that are invasive, unaccountable, and harmful to innovation and competition.</p><p>Filling these gaps in our cyber defenses and establishing effective data governance regimes requires a coordinated approach between the US government, critical infrastructure operators and private companies, and our international partners. The diverse array of threats we face require different strategies to manage them. The goal of my testimony is to amplify some of these issues and to propose potential solutions for how we can implement an effective strategy to deal with this challenge.</p><p>Risks to Companies that Collect Data</p><p>Collecting and utilizing data has become a key element of modern business. In virtually every industry, data has become a key enabler of efficiency and competitiveness, allowing companies to get better tailored products and services to customers faster and cheaper than ever before. But the data-driven global economy has also brought new risks to both consumers and businesses. These risks can be divided into three broad categories:</p><p>1. cyber theft of sensitive data by malicious actors;</p><p>2. lawful exploitation of data by governments;</p><p>3. regulatory and policy risks to innovation, competitiveness and economic growth.</p><p>A coordinated policy approach is needed to address these risks and establish a global governance regime for cyberspace that is sustainable, adaptable, and resilient.</p><p>Cyber Threats to Sensitive Data</p><p>Cyber threats remain a critical risk to companies that collect and utilize data. Despite significant progress on cybersecurity policy over the last decade, the threat of malicious cyber activity has grown significantly. Malicious cyber actors fall into two main groups, nation states and their proxies, and cybercriminals. While ideological hackers, so-called \"hacktivists,\" were once a major threat, most sophisticated hackers have abandoned hacktivism due to the draw of the legitimate \"white hat\" hacking industry or the criminal \"black hat\" ecosystem. With high-profile takedowns of leading hacktivist groups like Lulzsec and so much money to be made (legally or not) by those with elite hacking skills, launching ideological attacks that risk highly profitable legal and illegal businesses is no longer worth it. Hacktivism has not entirely gone away, but is a far less serious threat relative to criminals and nation-states than it was a decade ago.</p><p>Nation states and their proxies represent the leading cyber threats to US networks, with the resources and determination to penetrate even highly secure networks and launch attacks that represent a significant threat to the security of the United States. These adversaries are known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) because of their advanced technical capabilities and their willingness to persistently probe the defenses of hard targets to find vulnerabilities.</p><p>While as recently as five years ago we could talk about the \"seven sisters\" in cyberspace - the seven nations with meaningful offensive cyber capabilities, the US, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Israel and the UK - that list has grown rapidly in recent years. The US intelligence community's 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment identified more than 30 countries with significant \"cyber attack capabilities,\" n2 and dozens more are developing or buying offensive cyber tools and services. While not every country is capable of building up significant cyber forces on its own, the growth of the so-called \"grey market\" for offensive cyber capabilities is an increasingly worrisome trend that has fueled the proliferation of nation-state cyber attacks around the world. Private companies operating legally sell advanced cyber attack tools and services to governments, which are often used in illegal and unethical attacks. For example, NSO Group, an Israeli spyware company, was recently revealed to be responsible for a campaign of attacks on human rights defenders that exploited a vulnerability in WhatsApp. n3</p><p>Nation-state hackers and proxy groups launch cyber attacks to gather intelligence, gain economic advantage, or coerce and threaten their adversaries. For example, Chinese government hackers have engaged in a prolonged campaign in recent years to build a massive database on American citizens for intelligence and counter-intelligence purposes. By exfiltrating data from the USG Office of Personnel Management (OPM), health insurers (e.g. Anthem), airlines (e.g. United) and hotel chains (e.g. Marriott), among others, China's intelligence services have access to an incredibly rich database on the behavior, preferences, and vulnerabilities of hundreds of millions of Americans. They also gain a detailed understanding of their relationships to USG employees with access to sensitive and classified information. n4 This has significant implications for US national security. Chinese agents could threaten to expose an illicit affair or pay for the medical treatment of a family member of a USG employee in exchange for sensitive intelligence, or use the travel and financial habits of American citizens to identify American intelligence officers.</p><p>Another critical issue for US companies is theft of intellectual property and confidential business information. Malicious actors have stolen everything from the plans of the F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet n5 to the confidential terms of bids for infrastructure deals, allowing foreign companies to copy American technology or undercut bids by US companies. These thefts can be a devastating blow to American companies. For example, the theft of IP from US company American Semiconductor by China-based Sinovel nearly destroyed the company. n6 And nation-states utilize a wide range of attacks to steal US companies' sensitive data beyond just cyber attacks, including recruiting insiders to steal from their companies or provide access to protected networks.</p><p>Finally, nation states have used offensive cyber capabilities to launch disruptive and destructive cyber attacks to coerce and threaten the United States and US companies. For example, from 2012-2014, Iranian hackers launched a series of massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on US financial institutions n7 after the release of a controversial film that depicted the prophet Muhammad, and to put pressure on the USG during negotiations over the Iranian nuclear program. In November 2014, North Korean hackers attacked Sony Pictures over the release of a Seth Rogen movie making fun of North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. n8</p><p>Cybercrime has also grown significantly, driven by the development of a complex and diverse criminal ecosystem that has increased the capabilities of leading cybercriminal syndicates and lowered the barriers to entry for unsophisticated actors. In 2018, CSIS estimated that cybercrime cost the global economy more than $600 billion dollars, or nearly 1% of global GDP, up 35% from 2014. n9</p><p>The growth of cybercrime around the world can be linked to three broad trends. First, advanced tools and techniques formerly available only to the most sophisticated nation-states have become available to criminals. This is driven in part by the blurry line between criminal and nation-state hacker groups, particularly in Russia and Eastern Europe, n10 partly by the leaking of advanced hacking tools by groups like the Shadow Brokers, n11 and partly by \"grey market\" vendors who hire former hackers from intelligence services like NSA, GRU and Mossad to develop hacking tools for sale. While many of these tools and techniques are not necessarily available to a small-time hacker, they have fueled the growing scale and ambition of attacks by sophisticated criminal syndicates.</p><p>Second, the development of a mature, dynamic underground economy has transformed the cybercrime ecosystem. As the underground market has evolved and become more transparent, it has become highly competitive, driving fast-paced innovation by black hats and leading to the emergence of a market for cybercrime-as-a-service that has allowed unsophisticated actors to assemble highly lucrative criminal campaigns at little cost with minimal risk. n12 Where committing a complex cybercrime campaign used to require significant resources and a combination of specialized technical skills, today a would-be criminal can buy all the necessary parts of a criminal campaign online for a few hundred dollars: off-the-shelf exploit kits and malware payloads to commit the actual attack, phishing services to reach potential victims, 24/7 customer service to help configure tools and fix bugs, compromised servers and infrastructure to launch the attack and exfiltrate stolen data, and money-laundering and mule services to get clean cash delivered to the attacker's bank account.</p><p>Finally, law enforcement's inability to keep up with changes in technology has made cybercrime virtually consequence-free. Anonymization tools, digital wallets and cryptocurrencies, easy-to-use encryption, and polymorphic and partially automated malware have not only made cybercrime easier and cheaper, they have made law enforcement's job nearly impossible. A study by Third Way found that only 0.3% of reported cyber attacks in the US result in an arrest, and cybercrime is already massively underreported. n13 That number is likely significantly lower around the world, particularly in developing countries with little to no law enforcement capacity to investigate digital crimes. Law enforcement's challenge has only grown with the proliferation of cybercrime tools and services in the underground market. Even when attacks can be linked to broader campaigns and tools and techniques can be identified, linking any one of the many vendors and criminals in the underground ecosystem that offer that tool or service to a specific crime is nearly impossible.</p><p>It is no surprise, therefore, that despite much higher awareness of cyber threats by businesses and consumers and significant investments in cyber defense in recent years, cybercrime continues to be a booming business. Wider access to vulnerabilities, exploits and tools, efficient markets that reduce the money and skills needed to engage in cybercrime at scale, and a near-total lack of consequences for those engaged in criminal activity mean that the risk/reward tradeoff continues to draw talent and investment into cybercrime.</p><p>Lawful Exploitation of Data by Governments</p><p>Cyber attacks are just one of many threats to private and sensitive data. In many ways the more troublesome challenge for US companies is the growth of lawful exploitation of technology and data by governments. \"Lawful exploitation\" is the collection and use of data by governments through legal mechanisms but with potentially harmful consequences. US companies are increasingly global, and the major US technology platforms, in particular, find themselves caught between their internal policies and ethics and the demands of global governments to facilitate surveillance, intelligence collection, and law enforcement.</p><p>What makes this challenging for companies is that fact that many of these demands, on the surface at least, are not unreasonable. Countries wish to enforce their laws and protect their citizens (as they define both of these goals), and expect companies that do business in their countries to enable them to do so. Three key problems arise for companies.</p><p>The first is when countries lack effective governance mechanisms to prevent inadvertent or surreptitious abuse of legally disclosed data. For example, many countries around the world lack independent judicial review of search warrants, meaning that, even if the vast majority of search warrants are issued by legitimate law enforcement officers investigating serious crimes, there are few checks in place to prevent a false or unreasonable warrant from being used to access a customer's data for malicious purposes.</p><p>The second set of issues are caused by cultural differences between US companies with American values and their global customers. This problem is perhaps most prevalent in content management, where US social media platforms allow users to post a wide variety of content based on US concepts of free speech that are considered illegal and insulting in other parts of the world, for example under lese-majeste or political speech laws. But cultural differences don't just have to do with content. Balancing their desire to promote the free and open flow of information with the cultural sensitivities and legal regimes of the countries in which they operate is one of the leading global challenges for US technology companies.</p><p>The third is the exploitation of data and technology by governments engaged in malicious surveillance, repression, and exclusion. Countries like China have strict laws governing online speech and are utilizing tools like facial recognition, drones and biometric scanners to monitor and detain minority groups in the western province of Xinjiang. Companies that operate in China may have no choice but to censor and identify users engaged in political speech and provide the government with nearly unfettered access to their data if asked, and companies who sell these technologies to China may be knowingly or unknowingly enabling human rights abuses.</p><p>US companies and the USG have developed a range of technologies and policies to combat these challenges. For many companies, the most powerful tool in their arsenal to protect their users' data from lawful exploitation by governments is unrecoverable encryption. If the company lacks the technical capability to decrypt the data, they cannot provide it to foreign governments, even when served with a legal order. The implementation of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by platforms like WhatsApp, for example, prevent Facebook (which owns WhatsApp) from sharing the content of users' communications with foreign governments. Ephemerality is another increasingly popular tool that companies use to avoid disclosing customer data to governments. Companies like Wickr simply delete the data so that there is nothing for governments to take. The USG has also helped companies to avoid disclosing data, for example through the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) which prevents US companies from disclosing the content of communications stored in the United States to a foreign government unless that government submits a Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) request through the US government.</p><p>But this approach has significant costs and tradeoffs. Implementing technical solutions that prevent them from disclosing data to governments in order to prevent abuse is great, except that it can also prevent companies from providing data that could prevent serious crimes or terrorism. The rollout of E2EE on Facebook Messenger, for example, will render most of the tools currently used to identify and report child pornography on the platform ineffective, a serious problem since Facebook is the number one reporter of child exploitation content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). n14</p><p>And online crimes are not the only types of crimes being impacted. Growing challenges to accessing digital evidence, whether due to encryption, ephemerality, cross-border access issues, or simply the opacity and complexity of the digital ecosystem have imperiled global law enforcement's ability to investigate conventional crimes as well, including serious crimes like murder, rape, drug trafficking and burglary. It is not just repressive and autocratic states that suffer, but liberal democracies, including the US.</p><p>Regulatory and Policy Risks to Innovation, Competition and Data Protection</p><p>The growing tension between companies and governments has led to the rise of another significant risk to US companies: the adoption of counterproductive policies by foreign governments seeking to exercise their sovereignty over technology and data that harm innovation, competitiveness and economic growth. As more companies implement unrecoverable encryption, delete customer data, move data across national borders, and fail to meet the demands of governments for data, the inability to enforce their laws and exercise their sovereignty over their citizens and their data is increasingly unacceptable to governments. In response, there is a growing trend of regulations and policies placing mandates on technologies and businesses in order to ensure the government's ability to access and utilize data. Some of these mandates can create significant costs and constraints for companies, with negative effects on innovation, competition, and data protection. Other countries have turned to lawful hacking, developing offensive cyber capabilities or hiring grey market vendors to exploit vulnerabilities in widely used systems without oversight or accountability to gain access to the data they need.</p><p>For many countries, the first step in exercising greater control over their citizens' data is to implement data localization mandates. Our understanding of jurisdiction and sovereignty is based on thousands of years of analog law and policy, and controlling the physical location of data often makes it easier for governments to enforce their own laws about how that data is collected, stored, secured and used.</p><p>Data localization policies come in two forms: requirements that companies store data on physical infrastructure within the country's borders, and restrictions on the flow of data across the country's borders. Requirements for domestic storage are more common and are not entirely new. While they have become far more common in recent years, with new data localization mandates introduced in countries like Russia, India, and South Africa (among many others), many have been in place for a long time, particularly restrictions on certain types of data. As an example, both the US and Germany have long required certain financial data to be stored domestically for auditing purposes. Restrictions on cross-border data flows are less common. Under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies must meet strict standards in order to transfer data outside of the EU, while China bars companies from transferring certain data outside the country entirely. n15</p><p>Both forms of data localization create significant problems for US companies. At the simplest level, laws that require domestic storage of data require companies to build or partner with data centers on the ground in country. Restrictions on data flows can further force them to localize actual business functions in a country, in addition to the data itself. This creates unnecessary costs and inefficiency for companies, and can create operational challenges as it forces them to segregate data on the back end to ensure that it is kept within the appropriate jurisdictions.</p><p>Data localization can also make it difficult to protect data from government abuse. Having physical access to technology allows governments to use a much wider range of techniques to access and exploit that data, from malicious insiders to exploiting hardware, in ways that are impossible to do remotely.</p><p>Data localization can also subject companies to data retention mandates and restrictions on encryption that apply within the country's borders. Data retention mandates require companies to store data for a specified period of time, often to facilitate government access. In some cases they are industry or application specific. In the US, for example, the FCC requires phone companies to store your phone records for at least 18 months for law enforcement purposes. Data retention mandates are not new (the FCC rule dates back to legislation from 1986), n16 and have faced significant pushback from courts in many countries. For example, high profile court decisions invalidated the EU's Data Retention Directive n17 and the UK's Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act n18 in 2014 and 2016. Data retention mandates present significant risks to companies and their customers' data. If companies cannot delete sensitive data, it can be inadvertently exposed, targeted by hackers, accessed inappropriately by employees, or demanded by governments.</p><p>Finally, governments are increasingly pursuing mandates that limit how companies secure their users' data in order to ensure government access. Perhaps the most contentious of these mandates are restrictions on the use of encryption. Encryption is an essential cybersecurity tool. Data that is encrypted is protected from abuse even if a malicious actor gains access to a company's systems.</p><p>But certain forms of encryption, particularly end-to-end encryption of data in motion (E2EE) and full-disk encryption of data at rest (FDE) also create problems for law enforcement and intelligence agencies seeking to access data. E2EE and FDE refer to forms of encryption that cannot be decrypted except with the user's unique key. Importantly, while most digital data is now encrypted, the vast majority is not protected by E2EE or FDE. Most data is encrypted using \"recoverable encryption\" techniques that allow companies to decrypt users' data under certain circumstances, usually for the user's benefit. For example, virtually all email is encrypted using recoverable encryption because if users forget their passwords they want companies to be able to restore access to their accounts. Almost all businesses use encryption that allows for access to users' data so that when an employee leaves the company access to data is not lost, or to ensure that employees comply with company policies.</p><p>E2EE and FDE are almost exclusively used in two specific applications: instant messaging and smart phones. In recent years, the largest instant messaging platforms outside of China, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger (both owned by Facebook), iMessage and Viber, have implemented E2EE by default, and smaller services that offer E2EE like Signal and Threema have grown in popularity. At the same time, both iOS and Android, the two OS families used on almost every smart phone in the world, have implemented FDE by default. When governments request access to these companies' users' communications, the companies are unable to comply, even if the request is made through appropriate legal process.</p><p>The impact on government access to communications has been profound. Around the world, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have raised the alarm about digital evidence \"going dark,\" or becoming increasingly inaccessible to law enforcement because of changes in technology. Without access to communications between criminals, investigating and successfully prosecuting many types of crimes has become nearly impossible. In response, many governments around the world, including the UK and Australia, have passed new laws empowering them to order companies to maintain the capability to facilitate lawful access to communications.</p><p>Restricting the use of tools like encryption and ephemerality to secure data creates its own significant challenges. First, it requires companies to maintain some sort of access mechanism to encrypted communications that they have to secure against attack. Any \"master key\" or \"repository of keys\" becomes a magnet for attackers who want to be able to access user data at scale, and the burden of protecting these access mechanisms falls on companies.</p><p>Not only does this limit the tools companies can use to protect their customers' data, it has a disproportionate impact on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that harms competition. Google, for example, may have the resources and talent to fight off an APT trying to exploit Gmail, but startups with tiny staffs that quickly scale to serve millions of customers (e.g. WhatsApp in its early days) do not. With the cost of lawsuits and regulatory fines for data breaches growing every year, trying to secure an access point for law enforcement could become an untenable liability to small companies.</p><p>This threat is further fueled by the growing reliance of governments on \"lawful hacking\" to access data that is no longer available through service providers. Faced with the inability to access digital evidence through lawful process, law enforcement and intelligence agencies increasingly rely on legal authorities that allow them to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware and software to bypass security measures and access data. In fact, some researchers and advocates have gone so far as to argue for a shift in the law enforcement model from \"building vulnerabilities into systems\" to exploiting vulnerabilities that are already there.</p><p>This is a fundamentally flawed approach that should be discouraged. Lawful hacking is by necessity opaque and unaccountable. If governments reveal their techniques and the vulnerabilities and exploits that they use to access data through lawful hacking, vendors will patch those vulnerabilities, rendering these tools ineffective. Lawful hacking is expensive and time consuming and requires significant technical resources and expertise, and law enforcement agencies around the world already struggle with significant resource constraints. Finally, and most importantly, promoting the use of lawful hacking by governments creates incentives that undermine global cybersecurity. It encourages more governments around to develop or acquire offensive cyber capabilities, fuels the growth of \"grey market\" firms like NSO group that are linked to ethically and legally questionable activities that threaten human rights and civil liberties, and discourages the disclosure of exploitable vulnerabilities to vendors so that they can be patched.</p><p>And it is not just malicious access that poses challenges to innovation and competition. Complying with law enforcement requests for data is difficult and costly for companies. US law enforcement submits nearly 70,000 requests for data to the six largest US technology platforms alone, and all of those requests are in English and submitted under US legal standards. n19 Meeting the needs of thousands of law enforcement agencies across hundreds of countries in dozens of languages under the current system is simply infeasible for many companies, and further burdens SMEs trying to break into these markets with overhead and liability. Reduced competition and increased costs, in turn, harm innovation, reducing incentives for and resources to support RandD.</p><p>What Can US Policymakers Do to Address These Challenges?</p><p>The US government must play a leading role in addressing the many threats to data security both lawful and unlawful, around the world. The United States is home to the world's largest and most competitive technology platforms, which are responsible for protecting much of the world's sensitive data. Our economy depends in large part on the competitiveness and innovation of our technology industry, and our national security is built on technical and information dominance.</p><p>That does not mean that the USG can or should go it alone. The internet, and the US technology platforms that dominate it, are fundamentally global, and our approach to data governance and protection must reflect that. But US leadership will be essential to protect our economic and national security interests, and to promote the development of a healthy, free, open, safe and positive internet for all. The USG must continue to build on the progress of the last decade to strengthen cyber defenses and shape incentives and impose consequences on malicious actors. We must also empower law enforcement and facilitate appropriate and lawful access to data for governments, and push back on policies that seek access to data at the expense of security, innovation and competition.</p><p>Strengthen Cyber Defenses and Rebalance Incentives for Attackers and Defenders</p><p>Cybersecurity has progressed dramatically, driven by broader awareness, new security technologies, significant investment, and the growth of the private cybersecurity industry. Cybersecurity spending in the US grew has more than doubled since 2010, from $27.4 billion to $66 billion last year, n20 and in many ways the cyber defense landscape is nearly unrecognizable. A dedicated CIO or CISO has become the norm for many companies, boards and C-suite executives are routinely briefed on cybersecurity, and basic security practices like authentication, encryption, security training, antivirus protection, and information sharing are widespread.</p><p>USG leadership deserves much of the credit for this progress. Executive Order 13636, n21 released by the Obama Administration in 2013, created significant changes in the way that we protect critical infrastructure, establishing the critical infrastructure sectors, reorganizing how the USG approaches cybersecurity, encouraging regulators to hold companies accountable for implementing basic security practices, and incentivizing companies to collaborate with each other and the government to combat cyber threats. The development of the NIST Framework n22 established a common baseline for how companies and governments around the world think about cyber resilience. Perhaps most importantly, it broadened the way that senior leaders think about cyber risk management from a purely technical issue to how technology, people and governance all contribute to security.</p><p>But more needs to be done. In 2015 CSIS convened a Cyber Policy Task Force for the 45th President n23 to strengthen cybersecurity for the US. Its key recommendations remain relevant today. Despite progress, many companies still fail to implement baseline cybersecurity practices and cyber hygiene, and this continues to be the source of most breaches and cyber attacks. The NIST Framework is necessary but not sufficient to establish effective protection for national critical infrastructure. The Framework is broad and theoretical, serving as a good foundation for establishing a macro strategy for cybersecurity across the diverse range of stakeholders and networks that make up cyberspace. It does not, however, do very much to help a specific company or individual to understand the micro decisions necessary to secure their data online, nor does it lend itself to the development of concrete metrics or standards that can serve as a basis for regulatory oversight and enforcement.</p><p>The USG should supported continued collaboration between NIST and the private sector to build concrete implementation guidance and metrics for adoption and effectiveness of the Framework. This can facilitate voluntary investments in cybersecurity by companies and, where necessary, regulatory mandates to ensure that our critical infrastructure is protected.</p><p>The USG should also increase penalties for companies that fail to protect their users' data, and for vendors that fail to build robust security into their products and services. Companies continue to underinvest in cybersecurity because of uncertain returns on investment. For many companies, absorbing the hypothetical cost of a breach remains an economical alternative to the real cost of establishing and maintaining strong cyber defenses. Increased regulatory penalties and civil liability can raise the cost of security failures for companies, incentivizing them to spend more on defense. And this should not just be applied to companies that collect and use customer data. Vendors must also be held accountable for building robust security into their products and services, particularly vendors of connected devices that make of the Internet of Things (IoT), which are a fast-growing threat vector.</p><p>The USG can also play a role in addressing resource gaps that stand in the way of improved security outcomes. Talent, in particular, remains a significant challenge for cyber defenders. Not only do companies struggle to attract enough skilled cyber defenders, but the education and training system does a poor job of aligning the skills it provides with the actual needs of employers. The USG should invest in an ambitious education and workforce plan for cybersecurity, with a system for accrediting training and educational institutions; a taxonomy of cybersecurity roles and the skills that practitioners must demonstrate to claim competence in each specialty; and a robust network of professional credentialing entities.</p><p>Strengthening defenses alone is not enough. Creating consequences for malicious actors is the most effective way to reduce cyber risk. The sophistication and determination of APTs make it very difficult, if not impossible, to prevent them from exploiting our government networks and critical infrastructure through defensive measures alone. Defenders must defend the entire network 100% of the time, but attackers need only find one flaw in those defenses that allows them to achieve their goals. Protecting ourselves against these threats requires a combination of deterrence and international norms and agreements to shape incentives for nation-states and their proxies so that they choose to use their cyber capabilities responsibly and not to launch attacks on the US.</p><p>The USG has helped to drive significant international progress. Norms of state behavior in cyberspace, while imperfect and incomplete, have come a long way in the last decade. Two UN Groups of Government Experts (GGEs) released cyber norms in 2013 n24 and 2015 n25 with the support of all of the major cyber powers, covering many of the key risks to global networks, for example forswearing attacks on civilian critical infrastructure in peacetime. Broad principles that might seem obvious, but were once the subject of debate, have been settled, for example that international law applies in cyberspace, as does national sovereignty (although exactly what these terms mean and how they should be applied remains a question). The Tallinn Manual was released in 2013 n26 and updated in 2017 n27 outlining expert views from around the world on the applicability of international law, particularly the laws of armed conflict, to cyber operations. The Budapest convention on Cybercrime, n28 originally developed in 2001, has been ratified by 64 countries.</p><p>Progress on international norms has stalled in recent years, with the 2017 UNGGE failing to reach agreement on advancing cyber norms, but efforts are ongoing. The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) n29 was established by the Netherlands in 2017 to bring together leading experts to advance a common global understanding of cyber issues. Last November, French President Emmanuel Macron introduced the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, n30 a set of principles aimed at breaking the deadlock between leading cyber powers and achieving broad consensus on additional norms, but the US, Russia and China have not signed it. A new GGE has been convened at the UN, and at Russia's request a parallel Open Ended Working Group (OEWG), opening up debates around cyber norms to the full membership of the UN.</p><p>Deterrence has also advanced significantly. Ten years ago, the US had no clearly articulated deterrence framework for cyber attacks. Since the initial release of the Obama Administration's International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World n31 and Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace n32 in 2011, US cyber deterrence doctrine and capabilities have evolved significantly. Today, the United States has outlined definitions of the cyber threats to data, access, property and people that we seek to deter and the range of tools we will use to impose consequences on attackers. The USG has invested significant effort in building our toolkit to investigate and respond to these attacks, developing our capacity to use all-source intelligence to effectively attribute major attacks and to utilize everything from sanctions and indictments to cyber and kinetic retaliation to impose costs on attackers.</p><p>Yet norms, capabilities and doctrine can only go so far in the absence of clear political will to impose consequences on malicious actors. Attribution and cost imposition are key to deterring foreign nation-states from attacking the US and enforcing norms of state behavior, but both the Obama and Trump administrations have repeatedly demonstrated a lack of resolve to forcefully and publicly identify and punish foreign adversaries that violate norms of state behavior in cyberspace. International relationships are complex and multifaceted, but allowing dangerous adversaries like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea to attack critical infrastructure and steal data with few consequences out of a desire to pursue broader agreements on trade and security simply encourages other countries to develop similar capabilities and engage in malicious behavior.</p><p>Part of the problem is the opacity of cyberspace and the difficulty of enforcing norms of state behavior. The problem is no longer the ability to attribute attacks, at least for the USG, but the ability to convince partners and adversaries, as well as the public, of our attribution in order to legitimize retaliatory measures and hold countries accountable for complying with international norms. US intelligence agencies, and even the private cybersecurity industry, have become quite adept at identifying perpetrators of cyber attacks, especially leading APTs, but we struggle to share evidence of attribution because of concerns about exposing our sources and methods. The USG must develop a consistent and transparent approach to attribution, as well as channels to safely and credibly share details of attribution with allies, partners, adversaries and the public.</p><p>Imposing severe consequences on cybercriminals is also essential. Cybercrime has become an epidemic, and we have consistently failed to empower law enforcement to combat the problem. Addressing the scourge of cybercrime around the world is a huge task. The simplest is addressing law enforcement's significant resource constraints. Investigating cybercrimes is complex and time consuming, requiring technical tools and specialized skills. The USG should ensure that law enforcement agencies from the municipal to the global level get the resources necessary to build and maintain the tools and workforce to effectively combat cybercrime.</p><p>Empower Law Enforcement and Facilitate Appropriate and Lawful Access to Data for Governments</p><p>Cybercrime is just one small piece of the law enforcement puzzle. Many of the most significant threats to data protection, innovation and competition around the world come from governments' growing frustration with a status quo in which they are unable to access the data that they feel they need to enforce their laws, exercise their sovereignty, and secure their national interests. If the US continues to stand on principle and refuse to work toward compromises that at least partially address other countries' needs and preferences, those countries will continue to pursue policies like market access barriers, data localization, data retention and encryption mandates that harm US companies and undermine global data security.</p><p>Technology challenges to government access to data are complex and many faceted. To start, we can break down the challenges that governments face into a few broad buckets. First is accessing data across borders, particularly for law enforcement purposes. Second is architectural and technical measures implemented by companies to secure user data that make it difficult or impossible for governments to access data through traditional means. The final challenge, which is perhaps both most important and least appreciated, is the unnecessary and counterproductive friction between companies and governments due to information asymmetry, differences of values, and gaps in legal frameworks.</p><p>The MLA system which facilitates cross-border law enforcement access to data is fundamentally broken and must be replaced. It is too slow, costly, and difficult to use to be effective. The USG should take the lead in eliminating the MLA system and establishing a new regime for international evidence collection which is efficient, scalable, and builds in transparency, accountability and protections for civil liberties. The CLOUD Act is a good start, and the USG should prioritize the negotiation of CLOUD Act agreements with foreign partners, both by incentivizing them to implement legal reforms and finding ways to accommodate the different legal customs and practices of other countries while also ensuring that privacy and civil liberties are respected.</p><p>The implementation of security measures like encryption and ephemerality by primarily US companies has transformed the digital landscape for governments. Tools that law enforcement has relied on for decades, from wiretaps to calling records, location data, and accessing text messages have become increasingly unreliable. It is difficult to believe that this has not had a negative impact on combatting crime, terrorism, and espionage. On the other side, protecting private and sensitive data is incredibly important, and ensuring that US technology is not used in ways that harm marginalized and at-risk communities is essential to maintaining US leadership and values in the world.</p><p>Debating the appropriate balance of equities between privacy and data protection, on one hand, and rule of law and public safety on the other has become a fraught debate increasingly founded on incomplete and anecdotal data. The USG must take the lead in building a foundation of knowledge of this domain on which future debates around how we secure digital data and communications can be based. Do marginalized groups, activists, human rights defenders, and political dissidents actually use encryption and ephemerality to protect themselves from repressive regimes? Is it actually effective in protecting these communities? How much has the implementation of these measures improved security outcomes for users of the major technology platforms? How big of a challenge is this for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and what are the costs in terms of crime and threats to public safety from the resulting failures? Do the measures that governments are taking to compensate for their inability to access data through traditional means actually lead to worse outcomes for privacy and civil liberties? This data simply does not exist, and without it we cannot move the debate forward. The USG must leverage a combination of funding, incentives and mandates to ensure that this data is collected, analyzed and disseminated.</p><p>Once we develop data around the impact of these measures we must engage in a substantive, respectful and pragmatic debate about how to balance these equities that is based on the reality of the world that we live in, not the ideal worlds in which we wish we lived. We must put aside our biases and be open to all possible approaches, and recognize that all parties to this debate come to it with the best of intentions, even if they have widely different world views. Both the \"encryption and ephemerality can never be compromised\" and the \"companies must always provide data pursuant to legal process\" camps must come to the table willing to make concessions to reach better outcomes.</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing that the USG can do, however, is to take steps to ease the unnecessary and counterproductive friction between governments and companies that hold the data that they want. I partnered with a professor from American University, Jennifer Daskal, to conduct a multi-year study of law enforcement's challenges with digital evidence in which we conducted surveys, interviews, and roundtables with hundreds of law enforcement representatives across the United States. n33 The results were surprising. As much as cross-border access, encryption and ephemerality are serious challenges to law enforcement, the biggest problems for law enforcement are actually understanding what data is out there, which providers have access to what data, what the appropriate legal process is to acquire it, and how to make use of that data once they receive it. Conversations with international law enforcement partners have confirmed that this pattern holds around the world.</p><p>Our study, Low-Hanging Fruit: Evidence-Based Solutions to the Digital Evidence Challenge, outlined a series of recommendations to Congress, law enforcement, attorneys and judges, and service providers to help ease the tension between providers and law enforcement and facilitate the smooth and efficient exchange of information. Greater resources, clear legal authorities, points of contact and communication mechanisms, improved transparency and education and training for law enforcement, and concrete and consistent policies for the collection and use of data by governments are needed to reestablish these relationships on a stronger footing.</p><p>The study received the support of members of every stakeholder group, including law enforcement officials from DoJ to local police, members of Congress, national security leaders, international partners, leading technology companies, and civil society organizations. The USG should work to implement the findings of the study to ease the burden on governments and reduce incentives for them to pursue counterproductive policies to maintain access to data.</p><p>Finally, the USG should push back on governments that exploit data and technology in harmful and dangerous ways. If we offer a path forward that facilitates appropriate government access to data and enables governments around the world to protect their citizens and enforce their laws, we can effectively argue against policies that seek to fill these gaps in harmful ways. Data localization, technology mandates, and restrictions on market access harm US companies, undermine innovation and competition in the global technology industry, and risk the security of private and sensitive data of individuals and companies around the world.</p><p>I thank the Committee for the opportunity to testify, and look forward to your questions.</p><p>n1 Lucas Mearian, \"CW@50: Data storage goes from $1M to 2 cents per gigabyte (+video),\" Computerworld, March 23, 2017, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3182207/cw50-data-storage-goes-from-1m-to-2-cents-per-gigabyte.html\">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3182207/cw50-data-storage-goes-from-1m-to-2-cents-per-gigabyte.html</url>.</p><p>n2 Daniel R.

I'd like to thank--begin by thanking my friend, the Ranking Member Senator Whitehouse for helping plan and hold this hearing today. And I'd like to thank the expert witnesses that we're going to hear from in the first and second panels.  </p><p>In the interest of time, we are facing a number of--of competing hearings this afternoon. So, in the interest of time, we're going to dispense with opening statements. We'll invite--we'll enter your statements into the record in full. I'm going to dispense with my opening statement. Senator Whitehouse, do you want to make a few remarks? </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: I'll make brief remarks. First of all, thank you for this hearing Senator Hawley and thank you for your interest. I want to thank you for inviting back officials from the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security as well as a separate panel of distinguished efforts to speak about the data security threats confronting our nation. </p><p>The title of this hearing in my view doesn't quite capture the nature and the scope of these threats. The problem is bigger than Beijing and broader than any one industry. Our nation faces an onslaught of cybercrime. Last year the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center received nearly 470,000 complaints of internet crime, leading to over $3.5 billion in losses, a 20 percent plus increase since just 2018. </p><p>These threats come not just from criminals, but from nation-states; Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea particularly have all sponsored cyber attacks against American enterprises. A lot more than our personal data is at risk. Bad actors can paralyze businesses, hospitals, and governments with ransomware attacks. They can disable thousands of computers through denial of service attacks. They can gain remote access to our power and water treatment plants.  </p><p>International criminal syndicates make big business of this too. Often seemingly with license from nation-states. The federal government must lead the way in defending against and deterring the full array of cyber threats. Today's hearing gives us the opportunity to look at what we know about the cyber threats facing our country and consider what more we should be doing. </p><p>Here are a few places we could start: I've long advocated for the FBI and DOJ to investigate and aggressively prosecute cyber criminals, and I am pleased to see the recent indictments of state sponsored hackers. We need to make sure that federal agencies have the technical expertise, resources, and legal authority to pursue these cases.  </p><p>We need to build our defensive capacity; the NIST framework. Laying out voluntary best practices and industry standards for the private sector entities that operate and maintain critical infrastructure was a groundbreaking idea in 2014. But we still don't know if it's working. It ought to be stress tested and its efficacy assessed, and the plan updated.  </p><p>We can only defend ourselves against threats if we know we're out there. The President should designate a cyber security Discloser in Chief, empowered to declassify government information and share it with state and local governments, the private sector, and the general public. I've been happy to see DHS moving to share more information about recent cyber-attacks faster. </p><p>Finally, the U.S. need not act alone in an international coalition of the willing could agree to common international norms against cyber-crime, state supported hacking, and intellectual property theft, and hold accountable those states that transgress. We cannot let the bad actors frustrate our efforts to reach consensus with our allies about permissible state behavior in cyber space any more than we would allow the burglars to advise us on defending our home security measures.  </p><p>I look forward to discussing these issues, and I thank the Chairman for calling the hearing. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Now, I will introduce the witnesses. Mr. Clyde Wallace is deputy assistant director of the Cyber Division at the FBI, where he oversees Cyber Division Operations and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force. Mr. Wallace has held leadership positions in the FBI's criminal investigative division, cyber division, Human Resources Division, and many different FBI offices. Thank you for being with us, Mr. Wallace. </p><p>Mr. Bryan Ware is assistant director for Cyber Security at the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency, where he leads department policy development in support of department wide efforts to reduce national risks. He focuses on critical infrastructure, cyber security, federal network security, countering cyber-crime and improving the security and resilience of the global cyber ecosystem. Mr. Ware, thank you for being with us.  </p><p>And Mr. Adam Hickey is deputy assistant attorney general at the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, where he oversees the counterintelligence and export control section and the foreign investment review section. Among other things he supervises investigations and prosecutions of foreign, state-sponsored computer intrusions and attacks, as well as enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and the division's foreign investment security reviews. Thank you, Mr. Hickey, for being with us.  </p><p>And I'll now swear all of the members as we begin. Would you stand and raise your right hands with me. You affirm that the testimony that you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: I do. </p><p>HAWLEY: Okay. Very good. Well, let's begin the questions. And again, we'll--we'll enter your statements into the record. Thank you all for being here. Let me say as we begin that we face a major security threat from China. This includes our economic security, it includes our military security, and it certainly includes our cyber security and our own person data security. </p><p>We now know that Chinese officials were behind the Equifax breach from three years ago that exposed the personal financial information of 148 million Americans; that's almost half the country. We know that China requires businesses that operate in the country to share data with the Beijing government. And we know that Chinese companies are actively trying to scoop up the personal data of American citizens.  </p><p>And on that note, let's talk for a second about TikTok. TikTok was the most downloaded app of 2019. More than any other app in the country. More teenagers are on TikTok now than use Facebook. It counts millions and millions and millions of Americans as users. But it is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Community Party members in leadership and it is required under Chinese law to share user data with Beijing.  </p><p>And TikTok has admitted that it has sent user data to China. To put it bluntly, this is a major security risks--risk for the American people. And what kind of data is TikTok collecting as it runs on our phones? A heck of a lot more than you would think. Images, of course, that users post. But TikTok also collects information about the messages that you send, about the apps that you use--the other apps on your phone.  </p><p>It collects the sites that you visit. It collects your search history. It collects your keystrokes. It collects your location data. It stores all of this and maybe lots, lots more. And I can tell you, as the father of two small children who already have many of their friends on social media even though they're quite young, I find this absolutely horrifying. And we know that it's a national security risk.  </p><p>Since our last hearing on this subject, the Pentagon, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the TSA have all banned their employees and service members from using TikTok on government devices. In fact, the Pentagon even went so far as to say that employees should have their children uninstall TikTok from their personal devices. That's pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>But actually, it's only prudent. And that's why today I'm announcing I will introduce legislation to ban the use of TikTok by all federal employees on all federal government devices. This is a necessary step to protect the security of the United States and the data security of every American.  </p><p>So, let me just ask the panel: why are all these government agencies banning the use of TikTok? What--what are the threats that that company and others like it pose? Mr. Wallace, we'll start with you and then we can just go down the line. Anyone who wants to contribute. Go ahead, sir. </p><p>WALLACE: Sure, absolutely. Can you hear? Sure, absolutely, sir. And--and couldn't agree more with--with your points on China's holistic approach to how they're aggregating data. And I think TikTok is one example of an application that--that the average citizen doesn't understand the implications of what's behind it and what data can flow from an application like that that's--that's basically controlled by a state sponsored actor, right?  </p><p>I think that lends into the bigger threat that--that China poses today in that it's a holistic society approach to--to--to the United States, right? It's not just the TikTok application, right? It's the data warehouses that store that data, right? Whether they be here in the United States, owned by the Chinese, or within the--the Chinese borders themselves where that information is stored.  </p><p>Using front companies to purchase American data to aggregate it all with the overall objective to aggregate that data into a holistic database as we know that can be utilized for many purposes that-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --What--can I just ask you. Why is the Chinese government--do you think--so interested in all of this data? I mean, why do they want--why were they interested in Equifax data? Why are they interested in--in TikTok data, other data? You know--you would say well why do they care about the--the data of private American citizens? </p><p>WALLACE: Well, the ability in large data sets from the--the cyber perspective is with modern technology and AI, the ability to data mine through that data produces vulnerabilities for U.S. citizens, companies, proprietary information for our corporations that are operating both domestically and overseas. It creates a massive vulnerability of information that can be data mined in order to give a competitive advantage.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Very good. Mr. Ware, do you want to add anything to this? </p><p>WARE: No, I--I mean a little bit. I would just say that the collection of-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Is your mic on? </p><p>WARE: Yeah, I'll do that too. The collection of personally identifiable information, the kind of information that you described, presents a lot of risks and a lot of advantages to--to an adversary. We trade that information--consumers trade that information pretty freely for entertainment or for convenience. I wish we were all more aware of what we were giving up when--when we did that. There's certainly no place for applications like TikTok on government devices and government networks. But-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Why do you--why do you say that, Mr. Ware? Can you just expound on that? I mean, what's the particular threat on government devices and government employees, service members.  </p><p>WARE: Well first of all, I think there's ways that we can find alternatives for whatever feature TikTok provides through some other applications. It's a--primarily an entertainment platform. Probably not necessary on a--on a government device.  </p><p>But beyond that--you know--China has--you know--amazing programs now in collection of data and developing artificial intelligence and analytics against that data for purposes that we don't fully know. But when that data is our faces and our voices and our locations and things that are tied very closely to our identities, like our phones are, that should give us great concern. </p><p>HAWLEY: Mr. Hickey. </p><p>HICKEY: Thank you, Senator. The data makes it easier to target people. It makes it easier for an intelligence service to either recruit or hack into systems used by a government employee, a CEO, another high value target. And you can't just protect the entire--important data, right? Data travels in a set. So, when we as a member of CFIUS look at an acquisition, we're looking at what data is collected by the U.S. company, what's made available to its foreign acquirer.  </p><p>And in the regs that have recently been adopted by the committee, it's precisely this kind of data that we're concerned with because it enables malicious activity, either recruiting or hacking. It might also make China better at artificial intelligence, right? The larger data sets you have, the ability to cross reference data sets can improve your AI tools.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Very good. I'd like to come back to the point about CFIUS and your authorities and what more you might need. And maybe I'll have a chance to do that in the second round. Senator Whitehouse.  </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Thank you all for being here. There was a time not too long ago when we were reluctant to prosecute international hackers for fear of diplomatic and business blow back. After considerable delay, the previous Administration did indict a number of Chinese military officials. And that tradition now continues.  </p><p>Are there further authorities that DOJ or the FBI would like in order to more effectively prosecute these cases? Are you able to work around the delays inherent in the legate process? Is there something that the committee can do to be useful to focus the prosecutive (SP) effort more effectively for you? Why don't we start with that question and then I'll go to my second. That's for Mr. Wallace and Mr. Hickey. </p><p>HICKEY: Thank you, Senator. I very much appreciate the question. So, in my statement for the record I've identified a number of legislative proposals. But I want to prioritize three of them-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --Please. </p><p>HICKEY: First is a nationwide breach reporting requirement. One, it would have a number of advantages including standardized reporting standards for companies and the like. But I--I would urge the committee and Congress to consider including notification to law enforcement as part of that. Because we can't respond to what we can't see. And there are significant disincentives--some cases--to reporting to law enforcement.  </p><p>Right now when we think about data breach standards we think only about PII. But PII--notification to someone that their PII was stolen is not the only type of data asset we ought to be concerned with-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --Yeah-- </p><p>HICKEY: --We ought to be thinking about threats to critical infrastructure, export controlled information and the like. And--and DOJ's working on a proposal for such legislation now.  </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: That's one. </p><p>HICKEY: Second, addressing insider threats. Right now in some circuits we can't effectively prosecute insiders in a company or government officials who misuse their access to a network because of the rulings of certain courts. So, fixing 1030 so that we can effectively prosecute those we exceed authorized access is critical. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Okay. </p><p>HICKEY: And third, I would say extending the Economic Espionage Act to thefts that occur abroad but impact U.S. companies. Right now, if the trade secret isn't stolen from the U.S. or isn't stolen by a U.S. person, we lack the authority to prosecute it. Thank you for the interest.  </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: You've given us some good tasking. My second question is for Mr. Ware, and it has to do with not only TikTok but a whole variety of potential threats that come when Americans and civilians and other countries app--take up an application that may come with a payload of some kind that we don't really want them to--to have to--to have.  </p><p>It has always struck me--we've been at this for some years. In the previous administration, there was a considerable effort to try to negotiate international cyber security standards. And there was a relatively persistent effort to try to include Russia and China in those negotiations, which to me is like letting the burglars negotiate when your burglar alarm system is going to look like. I don't care that they're not in the room. I'm actually happier if they're not in the room. </p><p>And between the Five Eyes and our E.U. friends and other countries that are not malign actors in this space, it would seem to me that there's critical mass out there to develop some standards so that an app with the downside of TikTok and other apps that may have even worse payloads buried in them never get to market the same way they do because there is a much broader curtain of defense around a coalition of the willing. And I'm wondering what the current status is of your efforts at Homeland Security to build that coalition of the willing and depress the strategy of loading up apps with malign payload.  </p><p>WARE: Yeah. There's a lot--there's a lot to that. And I'm not sure that standards are--are the flexible mechanism to do it. I think they--they--they certainly play--play a role. We--we do work very closely with--with our allies. Particularly with Five Eyes as you mentioned. And maybe what we--what we should be doing--and I think we are having these conversations--is extending on some of these successes that we're having with the IT supply chain working group. Which we have--you know--for--for that task force, we have 20 of the largest telecommunications companies in the U.S., 20 of the largest IT services companies in the U.S., and--and 20 federal agencies work together to share information on our supply chain risks.  </p><p>To use the--the--the app concept more broadly to be software, the hardware, the things that--that we're--that we're buying and that we're installing in corporate networks and in--in government networks, I believe that that body has been an effective one to communicate on--on risks that any one of those industries or participants are seeing so that we can all see that so we can develop some best practices together. That is supporting analysis that's being done inside of CISA's National Risk Management Center and also feeds the FASC.  </p><p>FASC is just getting off the ground really-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --Yeah-- </p><p>WARE: --But the FASC is going to give us the--the mechanisms that we need to keep things off of or remove things from government networks, similar to the way that we've used bots before-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --I'm going to interrupt only because my time is running out. </p><p>WARE: Yes. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: I would like to encourage you to do that. I think there's bipartisan support for that kind of an effort. In the same way that you cannot buy a package of cigarettes because it's a dangerous instrumentality without reading the surgeon general's warning on the side, in the same way that you can't buy a mattress without the consumer tag attached to it, there is a way in which the well-intentioned countries of the world could surveil these various apps--particularly the ones that are becoming rapidly popular--and figure out what warning labels should be attached to them. And then simply make the public know what the hazards are here.  </p><p>I would really encourage us to pursue that effort. I know that would require the Department of State as well and the legate offices from DOJ and FBI. But it seems to me that there is a coalition of the willing to be assembled. Things like TikTok give us the example of the hazardous product that is unmarked to most people.  </p><p>And you don't have to have very fixed standards to simply agree to--like, let's do the ten worst ones. And then we'll do the hundred worst ones after that and start to try to weed the garden a little bit. Because at the moment, the weeds are growing without in my view and international strategy to get them out. Thank you. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Senator Ernst.  </p><p>ERNST: Thank you, Mr. Chair. And--and I do appreciate the conversation that we're having this afternoon. It's been very, very fascinating. So, thank you chairman for--for doing this. All of this data that we're talking about really just continues to feed into China. Lots and lots of data. And more--as more and more of this data is being stored in China, China is absolutely using it to build up to an artificial intelligence lead. And the United States has privacy laws. China doesn't. China goes beyond collecting their own--own data and what they're doing is illegally keeping all of our data and infringing on our right to privacy. </p><p>So, for the entire panel if you would, how can we prevent U.S. companies from unknowingly or voluntarily contributing to China's rise in AI? A stab at it at least. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Thanks.  </p><p>HICKEY: Well--so, we have fairly specific authority, senator. And so, I think we do think about where data goes when we review foreign investment--right--through CFIUS. Generally we take a laissez-faire approach to a lot of things in the private sector. And that has worked out very well for us and I don't--you know--I don't know--I don't assume that all data collected by American companies is going to China. But generally there--there isn't much regulation of--of where companies put data.  </p><p>And at DOJ, we don't say you've got to keep the data here. Just please store it someplace safe. So, our recommendation would be pick a country that subscribes to the Budapest Convention, one of the 60-some signatories which I think Senator Whitehouse has a good starting list of the countries that adhere to basic norms in cyber space. And keep your data there as opposed to an authoritarian country. And China's certainly not the only one.  </p><p>ERNST: Yeah. Do we have any idea how many of our companies are storing their data in China? I mean, does anybody really have a handle on that? </p><p>HICKEY: Of American citizens? I don't know that. I think you'd have to look at their terms of service. Some companies disclose where they store data. Other companies do not.  </p><p>ERNST: Okay. Okay. Moving beyond just joint ventures in China, here at home we're seeing unprecedented level of foreign direct investment from China. I think many countries are experiencing this around the world. But while the passage of FIRRMA sought to stifle Chinese intent to harm our national security, there's still some unknowns within implementing reforms to the vetting process.  </p><p>So, previous CFIUS rules didn't include venture capital investments and there was a minority investment loophole. Chinese investors associated with the military for instance could employ these shortcuts and kind of fly under the radar and gain access and influence over U.S. businesses with sensitive and critical technologies. So, again for the entire panel how are we working with the Treasury Department to identify those bad actors. </p><p>HICKEY: So, fortunately senator, FIRRMA, the 2018 legislation, broadened CFIUS' jurisdiction, so we can reach investments that are non-passive and non-controlling that would give an acquirer access to sensitive technology or sensitive personal data.  </p><p>In our regs, we lay out what we mean by sensitive personal data. So, just by doing that we identify for lawmakers, policy makers, and the public what categories of data we should be most concerned with. And now we've created a regime where we can review even those non-controlling investments to ensure that U.S. person privacy and security isn't put at risk by those investments.  </p><p>ERNST: Good. Thank you. Yes, did you have any comment Mr. Wallace. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, just from an investigative standpoint, looking at the wholesale China threat that's upon us, the FBI's taken kind of that position. We're the indispensable partner that sits kind of--you know--straddling national security and the criminal branch. </p><p>And we have the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force with the NCIJTF where we have over 30 agencies that are co-located, including Treasury. So, when we come across these instances of front companies and or supply chain--entering into the supply chain certainly around the DIB--or the Defense Industrial Base--and the clear defense contractors, we sit side by side with--with those agencies to assist so that we can work together in a holistic approach. So, it's not just specific indictments against those individuals but also how can we get sanctions-- </p><p>ERNST: --Right-- </p><p>WALLACE: --The whole of government approach to how we're going to look at the threats that are emanating from China. </p><p>ERNST: Absolutely. And we do appreciate that collaboration. Thank you very much. And--and we do have a number of American companies out there that have really given in to Chinese asks for their own interests. And Chinese espionage is more than a threat to our personal liberties, of course. It harms our national defense. And of course, I think all of us are very interested in that area.  </p><p>And Mr. Hickey, what--what industries do you think would be most susceptible to espionage? </p><p>HICKEY: I would start with the industries where China has said they want to achieve dominance. So, I would look at Chinese industrial plans like the Made in China 2025 Initiative, which identifies 10 sectors. And say well, if that's where they want to get ahead, if you make products or develop a technology within those sectors you're more likely candidate for at least IP theft.  </p><p>Then there's--we've talked about PII theft. So, it's a different motivation behind that I think. And then in terms of leverage, you--I'm concerned about a company that does business here but that is ultimately accountable to a parent company in China and susceptible to leverage by the Chinese government. And so, I think those who do--do business with those companies may be exposing themselves to an actor that can be coopted.  </p><p>Our cases lay out ways in which employees of Chinese companies doing business here have been coopted or employees of American companies have been recruited if they're working abroad or here. And so, I think the answer to that by the way is not China specific. It's to develop security plans that are essentially country neutral. Have an insider threat program, have a strong cyber security program which will protect you from threats wherever they're coming from, regardless of nationality. </p><p>ERNST: I think that's a really great point, Mr. Hickey, is--is that while--you know--we are talking a lot about China today, it is understanding how do we protect not just against China but some other bad actors as well. So, thank you to our panelists very much for being here today. Thank you.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Senator Durbin. </p><p>DURBIN: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. First let me tell you, don't take it personally that Apple wouldn't show up today. It was ten years ago in this very room that they declined my invitation to come and talk about their complicity in the violation of human rights in China and sadly, it's gotten worse since then. So, don't take it personal. </p><p>So, what we know is this. The Russians have set out to invade our election space. They tried it in 2016. We thought they were going to try it again in 2018 and we answered in a variety of ways, some of which we can't discuss openly in this room--with a measure of success in 2018. But we've been warned by intelligence agencies across the board don't assume they won't be back in 2020 in some capacity. </p><p>Illinois was one of the first states that the Russians hacked into in 2016. They took control of 76,000 pieces of information in voter files for 76,000 individuals. And fortunately for us, apparently didn't do anything with them. But they had the capacity to do it. So, we think we're a lot smarter in protecting ourselves now, but I hope we're right. We'll find out. </p><p>Here's what I want to do to bring this home from Russia to China. We know what the Chinese did in response to Hong Kong. Within their own country and using social media, spam accounts and other disinformation campaigns about what was happening in Hong Kong. Are we naive to believe that they would not interfere in our 2020 election campaign? I notice a nod of negative feelings that--we shouldn't be naive I think is what you're saying. And if so, what should we be doing about this?  </p><p>In--in--in light of the--the potential threat that we have. If not direct impact on our election process, disinformation campaigns coming out of China not directed at the Hong Kong experience, but directed in ways that they think enhance their position in the United States.  </p><p>They may decide, Mr. Chairman, that because of your position on TikTok they want to say a few things about you. I hope not, but let's--let's consider this possibility. What--what do you have to tell me. </p><p>HICKEY: Just--senator, one thought as I think it's--it's important to think about how different countries operate differently and--and use different tools. So, with China I see a pattern of using economic leverage to translate that leverage into policy. So, one example would be retaliating against a University if they invite a speaker that the Chinese government doesn't like. Another example would be suggesting to a U.S. businessman that if--it would be very good for him and his interests in China if he communicated a certain message to the Hill, or to an elected official. </p><p>And I don't know that everyone will think about FARA or statutes like FARA that are designed to promote transparency when there's an instance like that. So, I think we've got to be plain spoken about the different risks the countries face, and I think we have to invest in transparency measures like FARA to ensure we're surfacing instances like that. Because I think that's the vector that--that I see from our cases as more likely. </p><p>DURBIN: So, let's stick with FARA for just a minute here. In recent years, DOJ has required leading Chinese state run media organizations to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, FARA, which requires individuals and entities representing a foreign principle through political or advocacy work to publicly register with the Department of Justice to disclose their activities and maintain written records. </p><p>According to DOJ records, there are currently only 28 entities with active FARA registrations associated with China. 28. So, I ask you is the Department considering expanding the scope of organizations with Chinese ties to register under FARA? </p><p>HICKEY: I'd have to go check the numbers myself, Senator. I don't--I can't vouch for them sitting here today. But we certainly consider China one of the principals that we would prioritize in our FARA inquiries and investigations.  </p><p>DURBIN: Any other comment from the other witnesses (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>WARE: --I--I did want to mention--so, yesterday of course was Super Tuesday. At CISA we hosted both unclassified and classified operation centers to work with state and local election officials and to coordinate with the intelligence community and our law enforcement partners to ensure that the--that that part of the elections were secure.  </p><p>And--and so, to the original point of your--your question, when it comes to protecting the election infrastructure, the voting infrastructure, we're agnostic of the threat actor whether it's Russians or Chinese or any others. And it is--it is our belief advised by our IC partners that there are many nations that may have designs or desires to in some way influence or effect our elections. And--and we prepare for all of them. </p><p>DURBIN: Can I branch out in another are that's come to our attention recently? And that's the involvement of the Chinese at our universities. In research students as well as faculty members. One major university--I won't name it--and major science department at that major university they believe was recently compromised when the head of the department was receiving regular remuneration from the Chinese Communist Party or government. </p><p>Can you tell me perhaps Mr. Wallace, is this a serious problem that we need to focus--I think in our own terms, we have many outstanding Chinese students at our universities in Illinois. And some of them stay and do wonderful things. Others, obviously are there for a different purpose. What's the reality? </p><p>WALLACE: No, I think you're absolutely correct. And that's--our counterintelligence division working very closely with the cyber division--once again, this is one of the tentacles of the whole of society approach that the Communist Party is pushing to gain intelligence. They do that in the universities to undermine our R&amp;D projects, right? So that they cut in half the amount or not even half of what it would take to build a product, because they steal the technology. </p><p>So, we have an aggressive outreach program in our counterintelligence division with the academia to ensure that we get them up to speed on what those threats are. And that's a robust program that our counterintelligence division has. From the cyber perspective, we see it the exact thing. Same position, placement, and access from an insider that gets on to the systems of a university that has the ability to look at those programs. Creates a cyber intrusion threat, potentially to steal that information with the goal of furthering their programs over there with the hard work that our universities are doing around those programs.  </p><p>DURBIN: I--I just close by saying we are all consumed by the Coronavirus. We know its origin appears to have been in China. There have been some wild-eyed unsubstantiated theories as to what the Chinese might have been doing there. And I just hope we take care to guard our national integrity of course. But not to engage in this wild speculation that has no basis in fact. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Senator Durbin. Mr. Hickey, I want to come back to you. I've got a few additional questions. Something you said a moment ago about leverage, you're concerned about companies that do business here but report to parent companies in China. You're concerned about the--the--the leverage the parent company may have. Can you expand on that? Because I think that's really quite important.  </p><p>HICKEY: Sure. So, I think a Chinese company doing business here is obviously subject to our laws but will be reporting back to a company in China. And I'll give you an example from one of our indictments. Huawei is indicted in Seattle. And I should be clear, this is an indictment; these are allegations and the company's presumed innocent until we prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt.  </p><p>But at least according to the allegations in the indictment, Huawei--which had engineers and folks working here as well as in China--corporate Huawei wanted trade secrets from T-Mobile. It was doing business with T-Mobile and the employees working here said you know, we can't--we can't get those. We're subject to an NDA; we're not allowed to steal this particular--take this particular technology. </p><p>So, according to the indictment the parent company sent engineers here under the guise of being employees to do business here. But in fact, were given the direction to steal that technology since the U.S. employees didn't seem to be up to the task. And at or around this time, according to the indictment, a memo goes out companywide saying in sum and substance, if you take information that's proprietary and it's valuable, we'll reward you. So, send it to this secure email box.  </p><p>That's what concerns me, is that companies doing business here are nominally subject to our laws but may also be following directions from abroad. And so, you have to think about whether that parents company operates in an environment where it is either going to respect our laws because it's in interest to do so--it's interest to do so. Or is it going to follow a different directive.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Let me ask you, CFIUS has--has tools to block acquisitions, in some cases to unwind acquisitions by foreign companies of--of American based companies. Do you feel that you have adequate tools when--you know--a nation-state, let's say China, instead of acquiring a company just introduces an app into the American market? What--it seems to me there'd be similar security concerns--could be similar security concerns in terms of the amount of data that they could gather. Does CFIUS have tools that you need to address that kind of scenario? </p><p>HICKEY: I think the committee would probably say that that threat falls outside what CFIUS should do. But that doesn't mean it isn't a threat worth addressing. And I think the President and the Administration recognized this last May when it issued the executive order on securing the information and communication telecommunications supply chain. Bit of a mouthful-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Say that ten times fast-- </p><p>HICKEY: --But the--the--the long and the short of it is, we shouldn't just be concerned about investments of capital here. There may be purchases of products and goods and services from outside the U.S. that could pose a telecommunications security threat or national security threat. And so that EO lays out a broad framework for how to address a situation like that. Commerce is working on implementing regulations which aren't finalized yet. But in the certain circumstance that's where I think that problem would be addressed or that threat would be addressed. </p><p>HAWLEY: Let me come back finally just to the parent company situation again. In--in a Homeland Security hearing late last year, Director Ray said that he was concerned about U.S. companies doing business with China or storing data in China because and I'm going to quote him now, \"Chinese law\"--this is him--\"Chinese law essentially compels Chinese companies and typically compels U.S. companies that are operating in China to have relationships with different kinds of Chinese companies to provide whatever information the government wants whenever it wants.\" End quote. </p><p>That seems like a really high security risk. Do you agree? </p><p>HICKEY: Yes.  </p><p>HAWLEY: And it--it gets to your point, I think, that if you have an American company that has a--a Chinese parent counterpart that is compelled under Chinese law to share data with the Chinese government, or to use networks that are controlled by the Chinese government, we have a major security problem. Is that correct? </p><p>HICKEY: We could. I mean, I--again, when you talk about a company doing business here I think differently about a--a subsidiary of a Chinese company versus a company--that American company headquartered here which has some market incentive--right--to--to take care that its data is held securely. But that's what we're relying on is market incentives. So, those can shift with time and with business ambition. So, it's something worth thinking about.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Very good. Senator Whitehouse, do you have anything for-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --Just a question for the record, if I might, to Mr. Wallace. Many, many years ago I think Microsoft was the first entity to go to court in a civil action--an ex parte civil action--and ask the court for permission to shut down a bot that was attacking or using Microsoft as its target. </p><p>Shortly thereafter, one of the U.S. attorney's offices pulled together a team that went after another array of bots. And in a similar civil action went to court and said I'd like permission to knock these bots down. Anybody who cares to dispute me can show up in court. Please come, we'd love to put handcuffs on you when you show. Nobody showed. They got the order and again, cleaned up the bots. </p><p>That then turned into a more robust and more constant--as soon as that episode was concluded, that shut down. But the department picked that up again and has had a more continuing effort at what I would call bot rooting, back to my argument about weeding and the garden. If you never weed, you get a garden that's overrun with weeds. If you weed constantly--and I think we've had repeated testimony in this committee that really no good comes from bots. They're pretty much weeds only.  </p><p>I'd love to get a written response to this question for the record that gives me a current update on where you are on that civil ex parte case bot uprooting program where you're just going through and helping the private sector disable them whenever they rear their ugly little heads. Okay? Understood? </p><p>WALLACE: Yes, sir. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Great. Thank you. Thank you, chairman. </p><p>HAWLEY: Senator Durbin, anything further? Nope. Alright. Thank you very much, panelists. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your work. We'll just take a second here and invite the second panel to come forward. </p><p>Well, very good. We're delighted to have a--a second panel of--of experts to continue this topic. And--you know--Senator Durbin mentioned just a moment ago that Apple had again declined our request to come and testify. TikTok has again declined our request to come and testify. So, maybe Senator Durbin we ought to make it a tradition in this hearing room. We'll just provide an open chair. </p><p>I just say again to Apple and TikTok that you have relevant testimony to give. If indeed you're--there's nothing that you're afraid of, that there's nothing that you're afraid to defend, come to this committee. Come to this hearing room. Take an oath like these other witnesses have done and testify. Provide relevant testimony. </p><p>Tell us about what you're doing in China. Tell us about your relationship with Beijing. Tell us about the kind of labor in Apple's case, and maybe TikTok's that you rely upon. We'd love to hear it. It's very relevant. And the American public, I think more to the point--the American public deserves to know. So, we have open spots for them. We'll continue to do so any time we address this topic. And I hope that they may see fit to actually answer some questions.  </p><p>We're delighted to have the second panel. Let me introduce them and then I will swear them. We'll follow the same practices before. We'll admit your comments for the record, but we'll move straight to questions. Now let me start with Ms. Samm Sacks. She's the Cyber Security Policy and China Digital Economy fellow at New America, where she leads the Data and Great Power Competition Project. Her research focuses on emerging information and communication technology policies globally, particularly in China. Thank you for being here Ms. Sacks. </p><p>And then Mr. Derek Scissors is resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute where he focuses on the Chinese and Indian economies and on U.S. economic relations with Asia. He is also chief economist of the China Beige Book, which provides large scale data on the Chinese economy.  </p><p>If you'd be willing to stand I'll--I'll administer an oath to you. If you'd raise your right hand. Do the testimony--do you swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God? </p><p>UNKNOWN: (OFF MIC) </p><p>HAWLEY: Okay. Thank you all for--for being here. Let me begin, Ms. Sacks, by talking with you. Last November our hearing on this subject revealed that Chinese law requires companies like Apple or others who do business in the--in the country to hand over data on request to the Communist Party. According to a number of recent reports, however, there are new regulations that may go further. </p><p>These reports state that China now requires companies like Apple to use government approved network equipment that is fully open by all accounts to Chinese officials. Which means that no longer can companies like Apple try to say that their systems in China are secure--their own systems--or that they won't hand over data. But they're actually being required to use Chinese approved government approved networks. And China doesn't even need permission anymore. </p><p>So, let--let me just ask you Ms. Sacks, to your knowledge, where do most cyber security assaults or cyber assaults typically come from? </p><p>SACKS: From the outset, I think it's important-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Microphone--can you push your--yeah. </p><p>SACKS: At the outset, let's distinguish two distinct sets of risk. One is what companies like Apple face in China where they primarily handle Chinese citizen data. Whereas TikTok would primarily--operating overseas would primarily handle U.S. citizen data. The first is really an ethical question.  </p><p>And here, it's a minefield whether we're talking about pressure from the Chinese government to hand over data on dissidents, digital content censorship as a precondition for market access. Even the potential the technology could be used in supply chains to enable the mass incarceration of Muslims in Xinjiang, right? These are primarily ethical issues. I think that these are bigger and more complex problems than individual companies are prepared to handle themselves while operating in China.  </p><p>But I will say that neither extreme--the idea that no threat exists or that we should sever all research and commercial ties with China--neither of these extremes serve U.S. interests and values. And we can talk about how to do that.  </p><p>Now, as for TikTok and specifically the question of Chinese government access to data, you're correct that a number of different Chinese laws and regulations and standards provider authorities for the government to essentially require anything that they want of these companies. I will say from my experience, my observations are somewhat different, and they don't necessarily let--lend themselves to nice soundbites. </p><p>There's a--there's a massive gray zone. It's a negotiation. There are conflicting interests. Whether it's the multi-level protection scheme, whether it's the new cryptography law. I think we often forget that--that Chinese corporate actors are not synonymous with the Communist Party of China nor the Chinese government. And oftentimes local officials have economic juris--they have economic interests in their jurisdictions. Which oftentimes is a backstop for how far they will go in actually requiring data access. </p><p>Chinese private sector companies routinely push back on data requests by the government. They don't want to come forward publicly about this because doing so makes it look like they're resisting their government. So, now--I've struggled with how to present this information. Why--if we end up at the same conclusion, that we can't guarantee that that data would not be accessed by the Chinese government because of lack of clarity of law, because of lack of oversight mechanisms, because there's no real channel to contest it, why do lawmakers even need to understand that that gray zone--that push and pull exists in the Chinese system.  </p><p>And I think the answer that I've come to is because only by understanding the complexity of Chinese system on the ground can lawmakers actually create effective and responsible policies to address those risks. And I'd be happy to give some suggestions about that.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Very good. Thank you. Mr. Scissors, let me--let me turn to you. You are an expert on the Chinese market--on the United States interface with the Chinese market. And you have written about American companies' dependence on the Chinese market. Can you tell us something about the leverage? </p><p>To--to pick us a term used in our earlier panel, the leverage that American companies increasing the dependence, the location of our supply chains for instance in China--the kind of leverage that that creates for either Chinese corporations or Beijing when they're interfacing with American companies, say tech companies.  </p><p>SCISSORS: I can certainly do that. So, trying to keep it simple, let's talk about the companies themselves in the context of export controls. As you know the Congress passed on an overwhelming bipartisan basis a requirement that export controls be updated and upgraded. The Department of Commerce has not produced very much in the way of implementing regulations. And in that process, we've had American companies say repeatedly we can't innovate as well without China. </p><p>They say this over and over and over again. So, we can--I--I put some in my written testimony, some numbers and I--you know--we can check those and talk about them. They're considerable with regard to U.S. affiliate sales in China. But they're telling us something very clearly. We can't innovate as well without China; it would really hurt us. </p><p>We also know the Chinese government has a plan to acquire innovation from everywhere they can. They're going to become more dependent on innovation--they admit this--as their country ages. Because of the debt they've accumulated--they're accumulating more debt today as we speak. So, we have--we can't innovate nearly as well without China--a Chinese government that really wants to acquire any innovation it can. And that's to me why you don't have companies who want to come testify. Because they're telling you, we are transferring technology to China because we need China to innovate and they want the tech. </p><p>And we can argue about the details, but the--the--the two main forces on both sides of the relationship say the U.S. companies need to transfer technology to China to maintain their position there.  </p><p>HAWLEY: And--and just to be clear when it comes to Chinese corporations, the Chinese government's interest in this. Because they need innovation, and they need--they need to import it or--you know--or they have an incentive to try and collect information from Americans. They have an incentive to try and--and partner or acquire American companies. They have an incentive to try to gather our data and--and our info. Is that--is that fair to say? I mean, is that-- </p><p>SCISSORS: --Yes-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --A fair simplification? And so, there--there is--there's a profit motive if you like. I mean, for them it's not just profits. It's national security, it's--it's everything. But their--the motive is very, very strong on the part of the Chinese corporations and the Chinese government. Is that fair? </p><p>SCISSORS: Absolutely. I focus on the economic dimension, that's where my expertise is. It's not on the national security side. But you're absolutely right. There is a domestic political incentive to--to con--you know--monitor the population. There's an overseas propaganda and foreign policy incentive as well as the economic incentive. So, the Chinese have a multi-dimensional incentive to extract information from American tech firms. </p><p>HAWLEY: And they've been doing that very successfully. Senator Whitehouse.  </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Thanks, Chairman. Ms. Sacks it's great to see somebody who graduated from Brown University here. Hope you were-- </p><p>SACKS: --And--and Yale Law School. I'm now a senior fellow at Yale Law School as well. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: There you go. So, Rhode Islanders are glad that you're here and I hope you enjoyed your years with us. Some time ago we came pretty close to negotiating a cyber security critical infrastructure bill. And the model that we were talking about we called Fort Cyber for want of a better term. And Fort Cyber was aligned with your small yard high fence analogy which is that you let most of the internet stay the wild, wild west because who cares. But certain things, like our military networks, like our defense industrial base, like other elements of critical infrastructure would be able to find some heightened degree of sanctuary and protection and also be evaluated for their self-protection in Fort Cyber.  </p><p>And that blew up despite the fact that the bill was being negotiated with the number two on the Republican side when the number one on the Republican side went to the floor and said this bill isn't going to pass without Repeal Obamacare attached to it.  </p><p>So, a lot of effort gone to naught. But I still think that the idea is a sensible one. We obviously do that with our military and intelligence networks. The Defense Industrial Base has heightened standards that it has to meet in order to qualify as the Defense Industrial Base. What is your advice to us if we were to take a look now at our critical infrastructure protections? And at a very general level, what do you think the steps are that need to be taken. And a related question is does the NIST framework do the job? Can we just say okay, NIST framework has done this; we don't need to worry about this any longer? </p><p>My sense is the NIST framework has never been stress tested, is seven years old now, and needs to be reevaluated. And in any event, probably was never good enough to begin with just so I'm disclosing my point of view here. Would you respond to that? And if you need more time to respond by writing something down or providing me an article that is relevant in terms of a QFR please do so.  </p><p>SACKS: Alright. Well, I absolutely agree, Senator, that the U.S. government should ensure that U.S. critical infrastructure is protected from cyber threat. And CI--critical infrastructure providers would be well-advised to use the NIST framework. I think we're at a moment where it would be worth exploring whether the NIST framework itself needs to be strengthened; whether there's a need for further, more mandatory measures.  </p><p>That of course would come with additional questions, right? What are the costs--what would be the costs of making that mandatory? Whether it is in terms of the speed that technology develops and whether a mandatory measure would be able to keep pace with that. Whether it's about the impact of smaller firms.  </p><p>But I think what's become clear is that--is that there is--there is a--a sort of gap in terms of NIST originally being focused on more traditional kinds of information technology. Now we're seeing an expanded surface attack--threat surface. So, whether it's--it's cloud computing, internet of things, operational technology--OT--which is on the industrial side. I--I think it's certainly worth Congress exploring how an updated version--we can put in place more robust rules.  </p><p>And to the point on the previous panel, this is not just about Beijing. This is much bigger. And I think we need rules--more robust cyber security rules for all companies. You know--Equifax and TikTok, neither of them should be allowed to collect and retain the amount of personal data that they have. Because that will be exposed to--whether it's state actors or whether it's a commercial transfer back to Beijing. And this is certainly one tool to do that. </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Good. Well, thank you. I hope that the committee will follow up. We did some very, very good work in the past on trying to define what protections make the most sense for critical infrastructure. Defining what is critical infrastructure, defining what--standards is the right word because soon as you post a standard, the adversary defeats it. So, it's more a system or a referee who has to keep track of whether you're utilizing best practices. </p><p>But I feel that we've let that drop in Congress. I feel that the NIST process is the best available out there, but that doesn't mean that it actually is doing the job, either in terms of who's participating or how good the defenses are. And--well let me just end there. </p><p>SCISSORS: Senator, can I make a 15 second comment? </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Please. </p><p>SCISSORS: I--I'm not an expert as--as Ms. Sacks is in this field. But I'm an expert on Chinese incentives in companies. And whatever our defense is, there has to be an element of punishment. I--you know--we can have a very high bar, and I think that's appropriate. But what you don't want to have is a system where like hey, we've stopped 99 percent of cyber threats and there's no punishment for continuing to act that way. Because the incentive will say we get away with it. We didn't win this time; we'll just keep trying-- </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: --Yeah-- </p><p>SCISSORS: --So whatever framework Congress creates--and I don't want punishment to be--you know--frequent. Repeat bad actors need to face some consequences or there's no deterrence effect.  </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: Yeah. I agree. I think this is worth sanctions. And I was at least a fly on the wall to the conversations within the Obama Administration about whether to indict the Chinese military officers who were involved in critical infrastructure attacks and intellectual property theft in our country. And there was enormous pushback from the diplomatic side, from commerce and the trade side, and from big businesses that didn't want to have their Chinese patrons offended. They had important businesses over there, and they didn't want any pushback. </p><p>So, it actually took a lot of guts for Attorney General Holder to go ahead and insist on those indictments and--and do them. And as it turned out, I think it worked rather well. It did seem to blow back some of the behavior for a while. And there did not seem to be enormous consequences either in commerce or at state or against individual American companies. </p><p>But the reaction to that idea of American agencies and American companies saying, \"Oh no, don't do anything that would discomfort the Chinese, we need them\" has created a kind of secondary layer of influence that the Chinese can deploy that is unfortunate. So, I take your point and just add that as a point of reference around it. Thanks. </p><p>HAWLEY: Senator Durbin. </p><p>DURBIN: Thanks again. Ms. Sacks, you opened your testimony before the committee in saying that you're arguing for maintaining openness of the U.S. system, greater resilience, and new guard rails to ensure that openness is not exploited. Let me bring it on home to you to my example I mentioned earlier, what's happening on campuses and universities across America with Chinese students. </p><p>I am a person who favors immigration. I believe that trade between our countries is important when it comes to China. And it is growing and will continue to I'm sure. And I certainly believe in universities and what they stand for globally and domestically. And yet there is a reality here. A reality of Communist Party espionage, corporate espionage, things that are raising serious questions about whether we have the necessary guardrails to protect the openness of our society. </p><p>You're a lot closer to the college experience in your life than I am in mine. Can you reflect on what you've seen and what you think we should be doing? </p><p>SACKS: Thank you, Senator Durbin. And I'd also like to bring home a reality to you all from what it's like to be a Chinese student at an American university today. Xenophobia and racism are rising. Not all Chinese students are spies, and the reality is that Chinese students feel caught between two worlds. One, a Communist Party in China that is monitoring and tracking and trying to censor what they say on campuses here. And a law enforcement community that is harassing them and making them feel unwelcome. They're caught between two worlds; they can't win. </p><p>And I think what we need to do is make those students feel more welcome here while continuing to give our law enforcement and intelligence services the capacity to investigate and to pursue where there are legitimate threats. Not every Chinese student is a spy, but some are. And we need to be able to strike that balance and so far we are not.  </p><p>DURBIN: So, one thing we did at least some places was to close Confucian Centers that were student unions I suppose for Chinese national students. And unfortunately came up with enough information to raise questions as to whether they were dangerous when it came to these issues of corporate and national security. Tell me, I want to strike the balance that you're--you're speaking to here. What is the right way to do that and not close our eyes to our vulnerabilities in this open country we live in? </p><p>SACKS: To be frank, I don't think that Confucius Institutes are the problem. I mean, there was a government accountability office report. It's about 200 pages long, this GO report. It specifically looked at in a very objective, fact-based way whether Confucius Institutes are spreading CCP influence campaigns and what the effects are. There was--there was really nothing there that they found in the report.  </p><p>Confucius Institutes in many cases are providing language instruction. I have a--a six-year-old boy who I'm very eager to have him start studying Chinese, and the--there are not a lot of resources in schools for Chinese language study. So, why don't we do a better job of funding language study so we're not dependent on having Confucius Institutes to come do that for us, right? I--I just think that we're looking in the wrong places.  </p><p>You know--what's--what's clear is we need new guardrails. The openness of the U.S. system has been exploited. My question is are we putting those guardrails in the right places. </p><p>DURBIN: Okay. I--I--I think we're on the same track here. I hope we can develop the thought beyond that. Dr. Scissors, would you like to comment on this? </p><p>SCISSORS: I mean--I taught a Chinese economy course for about 15 years at GW. And none of the students--most of the students by the end were mainland Chinese students. And none of them were a danger to the United States. I--I don't care what they were doing. They were 20-year-old college students who couldn't even understand intermediate macroeconomics.  </p><p>I think there's a huge difference--it's not my fault, really. I think there's a huge difference between normal Chinese students on campus--which is whatever 90 percent, 95 percent--and Chinese researchers in labs with advanced technology. I mean, I--I--as somebody who was sort of a participant in this for a long time, I don't understand, like, why we don't say these are areas of sensitive technology. You cannot have Chinese nationals working on these projects.  </p><p>I don't care that it inconveniences you; you can't do it. And get the rest of the students--it's a--it's not a national security matter, it's not a matter of theft of--of very valuable trade secrets. It's a--it's a campus political matter that we can monitor much more easily. So, my--my split is about is there--is there a sensitive technology here or not.  </p><p>DURBIN: I will tell you when I raised that very point with some of the university leaders in my own state they said, \"But Senator, it turns out the best and brightest students in these fields are from China. And there are no American students who can parallel their expertise in dealing with these issues and subjects.\" So, for them it was a dilemma whether to just close down the research operation. </p><p>SCISSORS: Well, let me refer back to Ms. Sacks' talk about investment. But I know that 20 years ago they didn't say that, because we didn't have a flood of Chinese students. So, it's not impossible for us to be a very innovative, prosperous country without Chinese students working in American labs. And in fact, it seemed like it was--we were doing it pretty easily for a long time. So, perhaps Congress can look at recreating the conditions that allowed American research to thrive in the 1990s and into the 2000s.  </p><p>DURBIN: Well, I'm continuing to push more federal dollars into federal research, with an amendment on the floor for the Office of Science and the Department of Energy for five percent real growth. We've done in NIH in a bipartisan basis. Your colleague Senator Blunt has been a leader on that. And I hope that we do make that investment and take it down to the lower level and STEM subjects so that we have American students who can excel in ways that they're not doing today. But thank you both for your testimony.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Senator Coons.  </p><p>COONS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the panel. Actually, there is a hearing going on right now in the Energy and Water Subcommittee of appropriations where the Secretary of Energy is literally testifying about what is the dollar amount we should be putting into quantum computing, to artificial intelligence, to a whole range of new technologies. And Argonne National Lab was specifically recognized for its national leadership in large scale computing.  </p><p>But again, there's a big difference between the Administration's budget and the very bipartisan response from the Senators, which is we need to invest more in these next generation technologies. As we all know, there are significant advances in a whole series of fields that will create millions of jobs and tremendous opportunities that have security implications, but also implications across our whole economy.  </p><p>I want to focus on one specific issue, which is standard setting and the ways in which China saw 3G and 4G pass them by. We have fought relentlessly to reinforce and strengthen the global system that protects intellectual property and sets standards. The Chinese have figured this out and they are aggressively engaging. There was an election I think yesterday perhaps about the new head of the World Intellectual Property Organization. To my relief, someone who is from a country with a strong focus on protecting IP rights was the successful competitor. My argument would be there was a Chinese national who was there largely to undermine IP rights.  </p><p>Ms. Sacks, you've written about China's efforts to influence international standards organizations, specifically regarding AI. Can you describe in greater detail the strategies China's using to influence standard setting bodies and what do you see as the national security risks if China's strategies are successful in overtaking or significantly influencing most of the standard setting bodies? </p><p>SACKS: The Chinese government recognizes that they didn't have a seat at the table when the standards for the internet as we know it were set. And with 5G they've gotten ahead of the curve. You mentioned AI and I'll--I'll mention that in a moment. I think there are distinct issues related to I--AI and 5G standards. With 5G--you know--there is no question that Chinese telecom companies Huawei and others are sending much--are sending more representatives to vote and influence the setting of 5G standards. </p><p>On the U.S. side, I think that there's a number of things that we can do to increase the voice and the influence of American companies in that process. The--putting--restricting U.S. companies for--from participating in standard setting along with Huawei I think has undermined our ability to do that. And that's something that we need to revisit. </p><p>When it comes to AI, there's an active effort in China among scholars, policy makers, and industry to get ahead of the curve in setting standards around things like AI bias, safety and ethics. This is something where the U.S. has an opportunity to--to--to lead in this area and we need to step up to the table. The rules for these new technologies have yet to be written. And China's already rapidly moving to the table to do it. </p><p>I will say one thing though. This is also an area where we should be probably working with China on this. We know that they are actively considering things. I know we have a bill that--that's under consideration on algorithmic transparency. There are similar discussions taking place in China. But the question is are we--how are we thinking about these issues? Is there an opportunity for convergence? </p><p>I would also argue that there's a national security risk if we do decouple with China and lose visibility into the way they are thinking about these issues. That is probably far more dangerous to U.S. interests.  </p><p>COONS: Thank you for referencing the algorithmic fairness bill which essentially says if you are using an algorithm to determine eligibility for something, whether it's a--a mortgage loan or admission to a university and it has a demonstrably disparate impact on protected groups, you have to be able to show how the algorithm produced that outcome. Something that's currently largely opaque. But you also have to provide protections for trade secrets. Just--thank you for the plug. </p><p>Let me just ask both of you whether you think we've got a coordinated plan for developing and advocating standards around AI and 5G? And I recognize the difference between them. And whether you think the folks we're sending to standard setting bodies have the right expertise and that balance between civil liberties and national security to advocate for our interests.  </p><p>SCISSORS: I'll take the more general answer. I don't see how we can have a coordinated plan, because I don't think we've decided--and I--I'm very sympathetic to the views here and a lot of views of members of Congress. But I don't think Congress has decided, and I definitely don't think the administration has decided about our level of commitment to globalization. </p><p>And I don't mean that as an un--an unvarnished positive. To pick off of--of Samm's remarks, I am much more negative about our ability to cooperate with the Chinese under this government, under Xi Jinping. But we're giving up on globalization if we don't go to standards bodies and defend it-- </p><p>COONS: --Right-- </p><p>SCISSORS: --We're about to--we have a--a new program taking on the WTO where our commitment to globalization is also in question. I understand those questions. I'm not sure we can work with the Chinese under Xi. But first we have to answer whether we want to go to standards bodies and set up global standards, even though the Chinese are going to cause us problems. And if we don't, then we need to set up standards bodies without them. </p><p>I don't think that question has been answered. I--you know--there's--I'm not accusing anyone here of doing it. It's mostly a media construction. There's total decoupling and then there's nothing. Of course, that's not the choice-- </p><p>COONS: --Right-- </p><p>SCISSORS: --But--but the first question we have to answer is where is--where is an acceptable outcome on standards bodies for us where we are willing to work with the Chinese. And do we think we can get that with the current Chinese government as opposed to a previous government which was more cooperative. My answer is probably no, but I don't think we've answered the question in order to start having a plan. </p><p>COONS: And--and if I might as you follow up on that Ms. Sacks, it's obviously not a bipolar world. It--the world has many more players than just the United States and China when it comes to standards setting and technologies. </p><p>One question would be, since complete decoupling and complete partnership are these false poles, is there some role for a technology alliance for a--a multilateral effort with countries that have a similar commitment to open societies are also very interested in and engaged in innovation, but may look at IP protection and standards more similarly to how we do than the Chinese. Ms. Sacks. </p><p>SACKS: Absolutely, there--there is. I think the most important area of conflict that we need to address is between the E.U. and the United States on this. And here is where--returning to the conversation of how important it is to put forward a U.S. vision of internet governance and cyber security--this would go a long way I think towards creating more convergence with our European partners on this. </p><p>I think with the Europeans, with the Japanese, there's absolutely an opportunity, whether it's around cross border data flows and putting in place safeguards to facilitate that. Whether it's in terms of algorithmic transparency and the rules around these disruptive technologies.  </p><p>COONS: This field's moving very quickly, and Congress is not moving as quickly. And so, I think we've got a critical role here to play to play-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: --You're a master of understatement, Senator-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>COONS: --Indeed. Indeed, I am senator. And it--it's just a reminder that we--we've got critical opportunities here that we're missing to contribute. I recognize this hearing's gone on for quite some time, so let me simply say Ms. Sacks, if you--if you'd like to be in a state where every elementary school child has the opportunity to learn Chinese, explore Delaware. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Something our previous governor made part of the curriculum for every elementary school. I--I do think--just a final editorial comment--that our--the credibility and the relevance of our leadership on IP issues like standard setting in part depends on our having a strong IP system domestically. And we have done things that have weakened our own IP system that I think were needless self-harms that have put to question our commitment to robust innovation and the protection of invention in ways that we should be addressing at the same time we are trying to engage effectively with our allies. </p><p>Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. To our witnesses, thank you. And thank you for your work in this field.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Senator Coons. Mr. Scissors, I--I just have a couple of final questions for you as--as we wrap up. We talked a moment about--about the incentives on the Chinese side to import innovation, steal innovation, get American tech companies into China, scoop up Americans' data. But what about the incentives on the American side--the American tech companies' side. </p><p>I mean--you--we read reports about Google, for instance, and their hunger and thirst to be in the Chinese market. Or Facebook, the same thing. The--the compromises that these companies are willing to go to in terms of content moderation, willing to partner with the Beijing government in develop--developing platforms that will censor content for instance. All of that to gain access to the Chinese market. </p><p>Tell us something--why are these--about why these companies might be so eager--these big tech companies--to gain access to the Chinese market, to partner with the Chinese government where necessary. What--what's their incentive structure.  </p><p>SCISSORS: You know--I--I don't mean to blithe about this but--you know--it's money. When you look at sales of--by U.S. affiliates in China the most recent U.S. government data puts it at close to $400 billion in 2017. It's probably rose since then. May not be very--rising very quickly at this point, but it's probably over $400 billion. We have a handful of U.S. companies that are important on the NASDAQ that get 30 percent or more of their revenue from China. </p><p>To add to that an economic point, people have this idea that the--that China's a rich country. It's not--not anywhere close to a rich country. Chinese income--average income is about one-eleventh that of the U.S. if you actually measure what they have, not using GDP per capita but actual money in their pockets. If you have a positive view of Chinese spending on technology, there's a lot of growth left. And I think these companies feel like, \"Well, okay. Now I see China slowing down and struggling with their various issues. But there's still a chance that they're going to grow fast for a while. Because they're much poorer than the United States.\"  </p><p>Whereas in the U.S.--you know--two percent, that's what we got. China may be slowing to two percent. But I still got a shot at six percent. So, not only is there a lot of money but there's potential for future money. And I think that second part is still the draw. </p><p>Because they don't--you know--if we had another--an alternative for American firms--and we're seeing this with Coronavirus. Oh, well we're going to move supply chains out of China. That's nice. Where are you moving them to? We--if we had an alternative for American firms--they thought the Indian or the Indonesian or Asian markets were going to grow really fast they'd leave. There are a lot of problems in China. They complain a lot as I'm sure you know Senator. Behind closed doors they complain a lot. </p><p>But what they don't have is the volume of sales and the growth. They have the volume of sales in rich countries; they have the growth in other countries. But China is the one that gives them the potential for both. </p><p>HAWLEY: I just want to drill down with a point. I--I think you have--you've written elsewhere that the American companies that are most dependent on the Chinese market are our tech companies, as you just said. I mean, some of them receive about 30 percent or more of their revenue from China. Is that--is that fair to say? </p><p>SCISSORS: Yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: I would say there's a--there's a--there's a very significant monetary interest on the side of these major American tech companies in not only doing business in China, but to some extent pacifying the Chinese government just as there is a very intense interest on the Chinese side in getting these companies to sign these joint venture agreements, to share their technology, to share their platforms, and in many instances to share Americans' data. Is that--is that fair to say? </p><p>SCISSORS: Yeah. I just--to drive that point home, China reserves huge swaths of its economy for state-owned enterprises. Gives them monopolies. Those companies don't innovate. This idea that China's--innovates--China innovates when their private sector is allowed to innovate doesn't innovate in state monopolies, which means they're going to need those American companies for an indefinite period of time.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Very good. Well, I think when you've got the incentive structure as set up now with American companies that have an incentive to do business in China and to make compromises including with our data in China, and Chinese companies and the Chinese government that has every incentive to acquire as much information as they can from as many Americans as they can, you've got the kind of security problem that we're currently facing. Senator Whitehouse, anything further? </p><p>WHITEHOUSE: No, I'm good. I think if you have any thoughts on the question for the--the previous panel was asked about what a coalition of the willing might look like and where the sweet spots are for agreements that we could enter into to create a better international environment, that would be of interest to me. Question to both of you if you would like to answer for the record. Thanks. Thanks, Chairman. </p><p>HAWLEY: Ms. Sacks, Mr. Scissors, thank you so much for your testimony. And thanks to all of you for being here today.

My name is Don Henley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I come here, today, with a heavy heart, mindful of the chaos and pain that has engulfed this nation. I am aware that many in my industry have chosen this date to observe a day of inactivity and quiet contemplation. In being present, here, I mean no disrespect to those who have chosen to set aside this day. I wish to state, for the record, that I stand in solidarity with my brothers and sisters in the creative community, and with all my fellow citizens who seek a better, more just world, for everyone.</p><p>As a 55-year veteran of the music industry, I was asked, by the chairman of this Senate subcommittee, to come here and testify, today on behalf of the creative community - songwriters, musicians, music publishers - also known, in today's digital world, as \"content providers.\" I am present, today, not to be contrary, not to advance a personal agenda (at age 73, and indefinitely homebound by the Covid-19 pandemic, I am in the final chapter of my career), but I come here out of a sense of duty and obligation to those artists, those creators who paved the road for me and my contemporaries, and for those who will travel this road after us. It is truly unfortunate - and patently unfair - that the music industry is perceived only in terms of its most successful and wealthy celebrities, when in fact there are millions of people working in the industry, struggling in relative obscurity; people whose voices would never be heard were it not for hearings such as this one being held, today. So, I am compelled to seize this rare opportunity to discuss aspects of the fundamental issues that are foremost in the national conversation, at this anxious moment - fairness, rights, mutual respect and ... in this case, economic justice and equal opportunity.</p><p>But, the smear campaign has already begun. I have been targeted by the digital gatekeepers and their many shills and surrogates. It began last Friday in the newspaper that belongs to Mr. Bezos, and it continues, today. Big Tech was probably hoping that this hearing would be canceled, or that I would be intimidated to the extent that I would not testify. But, I will not be silent on this issue. I want to do everything in my power to strengthen the property rights of music creators of all ages, races and creeds; all styles, from hip-hop to honky-tonk, from rock, to rap, to rhythm and blues. From jazz to folk, to heavy metal. To change or improve outdated laws and regulations that have been abused for over 20 years by Big Tech ... the enormous digital platforms that facilitate millions of copyright infringements, monthly.</p><p>So, let me directly answer the question at hand: the notice and takedown system of the DMCA does not work for artists and songwriters.</p><p>* When a simple online search for a song returns an endless list of sites that never asked the copyright owner for permission, never received a license and never passed on a penny to the artist for use of their music - the system is not working.</p><p>* Today, when the marketplace has matured, and digital platforms continue to use section 512 as a negotiating leverage to pay license fees which are well below market - the system is not working.</p><p>* When the burden of policing copyright infringements on global platforms lies with the artists instead of the massive technology companies who own and operate the platforms - the system is not working.</p><p>The system is antiquated and badly broken. And the creative community is paying a very steep price. I have worked hard to establish my career and reputation, and I have enjoyed success. For me, this is a matter of principle. I am speaking out for those songwriters and recording artists who are struggling to make a living. Particularly now, as our industry has been decimated by the pandemic, we need equitable compensation for the rights guaranteed to authors under the Constitution. Given the current ban on large social gatherings and the indefinite pause in live performances, income from licensed digital music services may be the only real source of revenue music creators can rely on the foreseeable future. So, it is imperative that the devaluation of music - which is a direct result of the DMCA - ceases. And, as a result, creators be paid a market rate for their music across all platforms.</p><p>At the dawn of the Internet age, the DMCA was supposed to provide digital platforms with safe harbor from liability in exchange for cooperation in protecting creators' works. It was meant to provide a proper balance and symbiotic relationship that benefitted all participants and strengthened the legitimate online marketplace.</p><p>Two decades later, the balance is decidedly off.</p><p>In a world where more than 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, more than 1 billion videos are viewed on TikTok per day, and there are over 500 million daily active users on Instagram, it is clear that the massive online services are flourishing while artists have no ability to combat the rampant infringement that occurs on these platforms. As the U.S. Copyright Office said in its recent Report, \"the balance Congress intended when it established the section 512 safe harbor system is askew.\"</p><p>Content owners send hundreds of millions of takedown notices annually. And often, for each infringing link or file taken down, a dozen more pop up in its place. But even worse, due to the antiquated procedures dictated by the DMCA, internet services with clear oversight and control of content posted on their websites are continuing to monetize and collect advertising revenue on videos containing music, even after that music has been flagged by the music creator as infringing. How is that a fair bargain?</p><p>The astronomical number of infringement notices sent by creators is not a sign that the system is working - as some defenders of the DMCA suggest. That would be akin to measuring our country's success in fighting wildfires by measuring the number of attempts to extinguish them; instead, we need to seek out the root causes of those fires, implement preventive measures, and ensure that they don't reignite. Many of the enormous tech companies who benefit from the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the DMCA have the tools to do just that: they have the capability to monitor infringements on their platforms and provide enhanced tools for content owners. They just choose not to. They are capable of understanding and tracking the individual likes and dislikes of the fans who visit the platform with frightening accuracy, and yet we are supposed to believe that putting in place a meaningful barrier to infringement is beyond their capabilities?!? More accurately, it's beyond their desire. These tech giants are afraid that blocking infringing content will reduce traffic, and reducing traffic decreases their ad revenue. Instead of focusing on platform improvements that drive consumer satisfaction, they rely on copyrighted material - whether licensed or not - to keep consumers engaged. With the DMCA as cover, these companies simply have no incentive to improve technological protection measures.</p><p>The courts have facilitated this worldview, broadening application of the safe harbor provision, watering down obligations of online services, and eliminating consequences. The result is an anemic notice and takedown system that still allows Big Tech to rake in revenue by monetizing access to our unlicensed works, despite being notified of the infringements, even repeat infringements.</p><p>We simply cannot continue like this.</p><p>I applaud and I thank this Subcommittee for shining a light on the damage caused by the unfulfilled promise of a meaningful and effective notice and takedown system. Creators need recourse for the unlicensed, illicit use of their valuable works online. The DMCA is not providing that to them.</p><p>Like a classic song, album, or band, some creations stand the test of time, resonating across generations. Other products of the past are best left there - or updated to reflect the modern era. The DMCA has shown its age - it is a relic of a MySpace era in a TikTok world. Our nation's countless creators, most of them small businesses, deserve a system that recognizes the needs of online participants, a procedure that properly applies the rules, and implements today's technology with an eye toward tomorrow. Only then can we truly achieve the proper balance and the thriving legitimate online marketplace this institution envisioned so many years ago.

It is reductionist because it collapses the plurality of interests, actors, business models, and policy opinions on each side. It is dangerous because it explicitly overlooks both independent and small artists, as well as the more than 229 million American adults who use the internet as more than just a copyrighted content delivery mechanism. n1 In the current pandemic, every facet of our lives-- from studying and working to buying food and paying utilities -- occurs online. Every law that governs individuals' use of and access to the internet affects all of us.</p><p>Section 512 n2 is one such law, and comprehensively evaluating it is a Herculean feat. The Copyright Office took nearly five years and 250 pages to cover the issue in its latest study, and even then was limited in its ability to cover every sub-debate that rages on the topic. n3 While the Section 512 Report manages to cover a truly remarkable amount of ground, it consistently falls into the same reductionist narrative of a dispute between two simplified equities -- ''artists\" on one side, \"tech\" on the other. Let us be clear: However you choose to define these two strawmen, they are vastly outnumbered by the 229 million Americans going about their lives online. We were upset, but not surprised, to see that the Section 512 Report not only declined to acknowledge users as an independent constituency, but actively dismissed the concerns that affect them directly, including the misuse of DMCA takedown notices to suppress speech unrelated to copyright.</p><p>What, then, do consumers want? Users benefit from a competitive online ecosystem with players large and small, for-profit and nonprofit. Users also benefit from a vibrant creative ecosystem, where artists have a variety of avenues for producing, distributing, and promoting their work. These two needs must coexist, and neither can survive if it means sacrificing the other.</p><p>However, in our nation's attempt to reconcile the legitimate needs of artists and digital platforms, what has developed is a legal regime that, for all its good intentions, allows private parties to censor one another's speech on any online platform, at any time, for any reason. The only recourse under current law for a party whose speech has been suppressed is to file a counter-notice, wait 14 days, and potentially expose herself to a frivolous lawsuit. Fourteen days can be lethal to time-sensitive speech including news reporting, documentation of human rights abuses, political speech, public debate, and critique--not to mention the loss of revenue for those individuals who rely on their speech for income. Despite this, certain stakeholders balk at the idea of introducing additional safeguards into this system. Instead, they insist that the targeted speech must be removed faster, n4 with a longer period before reinstatement, n5 and the removal must be executed without any human oversight or verification of claims. n6</p><p>More alarmingly, many stakeholders contend that portions of Section 512 give them the right to demand that an individual's access to the internet be terminated if they suspect that individual of infringing copyright. It goes without saying that Congress should not be making it easier for private actors to completely and unilaterally remove a person's ability to access the entire internet.</p><p>Musicians, digital platforms, large-scale commercial rightsholders, and internet users all face distinct challenges from the system created by Section 512. If we are to strike any sort of \"new balance,\" it must keep our nation's 229 million internet users -- and the law's impact on their ability to speak -- at front of mind.</p><p>The Problem of Bad Notices</p><p>As with any enforcement regime, errors are inevitable. But the current DMCA notice-and-takedown system suffers from a disproportionate number of bad notices that affect the ability of users and creators to use the internet for free expression and creativity, and hide information from public view. After quantitatively examining a set of over 108 million takedown requests, researchers concluded that approximately 30% of the requests were \"potentially problematic\" and that 4.5 million of those requests were \"fundamentally flawed.\" n7 Bad notices are, by any measure, pervasive.</p><p>Bad notices stem from a variety of sources that range from banal errors to bad faith abuse. Generally, they can be broken down into four categories: abuse of copyright, abuse of the DMCA takedown procedure, technical flaws, and algorithmic defects. Similarly, the goals and motivations behind bad notices can range from censorship to innocent error to overzealous enforcement. Even at their most granular, each category still accounts for millions of problematic takedown notices. n8 Any solution to address the bad notice problem requires an understanding of these categories and how they occur.</p><p>Copyright abuse occurs when a notice sender uses targeted DMCA takedowns to improperly remove content that incorporates or references their work, but is obviously noninfringing. The result is an abusive enforcement For example, last year several unreleased seasons of Starz shows and three episodes of American Gods were leaked to the public on a Russian streaming site. Starz used the DMCA takedown process to remove tweets and articles that reported about the incident, even though the coverage did not itself contain any infringing material. n9 Starz was able to leverage the DMCA process to force the erasure of legitimate journalism. This type of abuse also served as the catalyst for copyright law's most recent scandal--a feud between competing series which both pulled unprotectable scenes-a-faire elements from the popular \"omegaverse\" trope in fanfiction. n10 Author Addison Cain had her publisher send DMCA notices against her competitor's work on several online retail sites. Cain claimed that she had a copyright interest in these stock elements--despite the fact that she had not created them. n11</p><p>In contrast, DMCA abuse occurs when a claimant uses the notice-and-takedown process to remove or temporarily disable unfavorable content for reasons wholly unrelated to copyright. One of the most notorious forms of this is a practice known as \"backdating.\" In order to remove or hide content, the actor will make a copy of the content and post it on an obscure site, backdating the copied material to a time before the original post. They will then file a DMCA takedown notice with OSPs like Google, forcing removal of the higher-profile result from search results, and burying the newer, obscure source far down the results. News outlet Benzinga was a victim of this exact practice after it published an article about the financial difficulties faced by Amira Nature Foods, a publicly traded company. n12 Other groups, including the Church of Scientology, have used false takedown claims to censor criticism and harass former members. n13 Repressive regimes across the world, from Russia n14 to Ecuador, n15 have become adept abusers of the DMCA notice-and-takedown regime to stifle critics and suppress coverage of human rights abuses.</p><p>Most bad notices are the result of technical errors. These errors implicate fundamental due process protections built in to the DMCA's notice-and-takedown requirements. Two of the most substantively important notice requirements--that there is sufficient information about the allegedly infringed work (\"AIW\") n16 and allegedly infringing material (\"AIM\") n17--are often inadequately addressed. n18 The same study that found problems with 30% of all takedown notices also discovered that it was difficult to identify the AIM in 13.3% of requests, and difficult to identify the AIW in 6% of requests. n19 When copyright owners send a notification that covers more than one infringing or infringed-upon work, they do not always provide clear details on where the works are located. This has resulted in substantial, costly litigation over whether rights-holders or OSPs bear the cost of identifying infringing work. n20</p><p>The rise of algorithmic systems to handle DMCA takedown notices and responses has resulted in a rise in bad notices due to algorithmic error. Recently, in what was widely considered a flaw of automated rights-monitoring, NBC issued takedown notices concerning NASA's livestream of the attempted SpaceX launch. n21 In another case, algorithmic enforcement \"blocked a 10-year-old boy's self-authored original video starring his LEGO mini-figures and garbage truck despite the fact that he used royalty-free music.\" n22 Ultimately, the detrimental cost to our online and creative ecosystems can no longer justify a system that skews so far to the side of those issuing takedown notices.</p><p>Given the known issues with deficient, inaccurate, or abusive takedown notices, as well as the functional dead-letter status of the safeguards outlined in Section 512(f), n23 some digital platforms have begun requesting that claimants submit additional information or respond to queries when issuing a takedown. Alarmingly, the Copyright Office's Section 512 study decides that these requests are sufficient to strip a platform of its safe harbor. n24 In short, this position holds that all notices, no matter how obviously spurious or in bad faith, must be honored without further inquiry.</p><p>It bears repeating: The DMCA's notice-and-takedown provisions are extraordinarily powerful tools with a documented history of weaponization. In the absence of meaningful statutory safeguards, platforms have stepped in to monitor for common errors, be they born from anticompetitive behavior, a misunderstanding of copyright, n25 or merely mistakes in automated enforcement monitoring. None of this diminishes the difficulty faced by artists attempting to police the use of their copyrighted content online; however, we must acknowledge the enormous power of these takedown notices, their documented history of misuse, and the profound effect of that misuse on lawful speech. Asking for faster, more powerful notices with fewer safeguards is akin to throwing aside a tank and asking for a nuke.</p><p>The internet is not a monolith, and neither are the communities within it. These communities, and the platforms on which they congregate, have different risk profiles for use (and misuse) of DMCA notices. For example, the Hugo Award-winning Archive of Our Own, maintained by the nonprofit Organization for Transformative Works, hosts more than four million works and has been constructed from the ground up by an army of volunteer fans, lawyers, and coders to reflect that community's priorities. n26 Other sites, such as TikTok, base their core functionality around users' ability to share, remix, and build upon one another's work, attracting users specifically because of that function. And some sites, such as ecommerce platforms, are more at risk for abusive or anticompetitive takedown notices that could substantially prejudice the economic interests of merchants or artists using the platform. n27 In short, one size does not fit all.</p><p>The Limits of Private Enforcement Mechanisms</p><p>We cannot reasonably think about reforming Section 512 without understanding the private enforcement mechanisms that stakeholders have held out as possible solutions. Given the time and expense of federal litigation faced by rights-holders (and the pressures of operating at scale faced by platforms), it is unsurprising that many stakeholders have embraced the idea of technological solutions. But while automated private solutions \"might sound good in theory,\" the messy realities of implementation -- technological limitations, complex legal protections and provisions, and the influence of a designer's commercial interests -- \"raises a slew of questions regarding policy.\" n28 Private enforcement \"can have the same far-reaching effect as actual law,\" including the ability to deprive users of legitimate income streams, \"without any corresponding due process or accountability.\" n29 Because they operate automatically, these algorithms have the remarkable power to almost instantaneously erase speech -- including political speech, education, news, and speech which supports the livelihoods of millions of creators who derive their primary income via platforms with algorithmic content matching.</p><p>The way in which these systems operate is determined by the particular needs, commercial interests, and resource limitations of the developer and any large stakeholders with which that developer is cooperating. Policymakers must grapple with what users and artists alike have understood for ages -- that the balance of equities in practice is determined less by the contours of law than by the aggregate results of numerous design choices which often have \"more profitable\" or \"less profitable\" answers, but rarely have clear right or wrong ones. An automated system which perfectly serves the needs of any one stakeholder -- be it platforms, commercial-scale rights-holders, users, or small artists -- invariably prejudices the interests of the remaining stakeholders.</p><p>Most private enforcement mechanisms today rely on algorithmic content identification. Some stakeholders have proposed systems, such as notice-and-staydown, which condition legal immunity on a platform implementing and expanding these systems to include identifying and filtering content at the point of upload. In order to understand the limits of those proposals, policymakers must first understand both how they work and how they can fail.</p><p>Algorithmic matching has numerous steps, which we will necessarily simplify here. First, the system designer must compile and maintain a database of known content to which the algorithm can refer. A robust database contains, among other things, a reference file and ownership information for each work. The algorithm then uses reference files to create digital \"fingerprints,\" which it compares against unknown media in an attempt to identify it. n30 When the algorithm returns a match, it provides rights-holders with a series of options. The scope and availability of these options depends on the design of the system, the level of access granted to the rights-holder, and other variables. Common options include claiming the content's ad revenue, taking the content offline (either in toto or selectively disabling the matching piece), or doing nothing. n31</p><p>Though various kinds of errors can occur throughout this process, users are most frequently affected by \"false positives\" -- situations in which the algorithm incorrectly identifies content they have uploaded as infringing. Three common points of failure are errors in the database; erroneous flagging of content that does not match the reference file; and \"content that matches the reference file and is owned by the claimant, but constitutes a legal use of the content.\" n32</p><p>1. Database errors.</p><p>The first category of false positives -- where the flagged content matches a reference file in the database, but the database's ownership information is incorrect -- can be broadly thought of as database errors. These happen for reasons that range from banal to malicious. Some database errors are caused by malicious actors making false claims of ownership, a problem that was particularly acute on YouTube in the early 2010s. n33 A low-quality or overbroad reference file can cause an algorithm to throw false matches. n34 They can also happen inadvertently, as when new media incorporates pre-existing clips; adding the new media to the database triggers a paradoxical takedown of the older clip. n35</p><p>However, these kinds of false positives force us to confront difficult questions around database design, integrity, and access. In an ideal world, a content-matching database would be full of high-quality reference files, complete with thorough, current, and accurate information on ownership, licensing, and payment. An ideal database would also be widely open and available to artists who wish to use it to monitor (or monetize) their work. However, these two principles are often in tension; letting anyone put their work into the database creates a greater risk of introducing errors into the system, while maintaining a curated database necessarily cuts out some universe of potential artists from using it.</p><p>Moreover, any commercial database will reflect the priorities -- and blind spots -- of its designer. These decisions affect who is allowed to populate it, how that information is vetted or revised, the oversight and handling of ownership disputes, and the transparency (or lack thereof) regarding its operation. We need look no further than the debates surrounding YouTube's Content ID system to see the risks and trade-offs of a private, in-house fingerprinting system designed specifically to address that platform's financial interests. n36</p><p>2.Strict vs \"fuzzy\" algorithms.</p><p>The second failure case -- flagging content that does not match the reference file -reflects yet another trade-off in algorithmic design. Algorithms that only flag exact or near-exact matches protect a greater range of unlicensed, yet legal, uses and exert less of a chilling influence on user speech. However, they are also easier to circumvent through basic manipulation of the underlying media, such as altering the tempo or pitch of a sound recording, or flipping a video to its mirror image. n37 Algorithms that flag \"fuzzy\" matches will be harder to evade, but will throw more false positives and stifle some legitimate uses of content.</p><p>It is worth noting that the degree of \"fuzziness\" in an algorithm is a design choice that explicitly prioritizes certain genres and styles of content over others. Fuzzy algorithms are good at catching and flagging algorithm-evading \"edits\" to popular content such as Top-40 hits. However, those same algorithms struggle when faced with classical and jazz music, where the underlying musical work is often in the public domain, and the difference between a copyrighted recording and a public domain or live performance may be as little as a few notes on an improvisational section, or the sound qualify of the space in which it was recorded. n38 Content ID, often held up as the industry standard of content-matching, once erroneously flagged a video that was ten minutes of solid (original) white noise. n39</p><p>3. Legally permissible uses.</p><p>Perhaps the most intractable problem surrounding content fingerprinting and filters is algorithms simply cannot account for legally permitted uses of copyrighted material. Unlike an algorithm, copyright law is not absolute; the American system provides a number of exceptions and limitations that serve as a \"safety valve\" to protect legitimate policy ends. The Supreme Court has described these limitations and exceptions -- specifically citing fair use -- as \"built-in First Amendment accommodations\" to prevent copyright law from unduly stifling speech. n40 These contours of copyright law, however, depend heavily on social, factual, and cultural context. The fundamental balance of copyright law rests in \"[d]etailed doctrines ... carefully designed to guide traditional, human law enforcement agents in addressing these questions\" of appropriate unlicensed use. n41 Algorithmic enforcement, as a binary system designed to equate the presence of copyrighted content with its misuse, \"is blatantly hostile to users' interests because it shifts the neutral presumption of fair use against them.\" n42 Moreover, systems such as Content ID allow rights-holders to instantaneously divert revenue streams away from claimees upon filing a claim, leading to lost revenue, and, in one case, jeopardizing a prominent YouTuber's income from outside brand sponsorship. n43</p><p>Broadband Providers Do Not Belong in the DMCA Framework</p><p>If lawmakers only take away one point of reform from this process, it should be this: We should not permit, let alone strengthen, provisions of law which allow third-party private actors to unilaterally terminate a person's internet access. The Federal Communications Commission has found that Americans use broadband \"for every facet of daily life.\" n44 During the pandemic, Congress has paid heightened attention to the importance of broadband to people's work, education, social life, and health care. n45 Broadband providers have pledged not to cut off people's broadband for non-payment, and Congress has proposed several bills designed to close the digital divide and ensure that broadband, an essential communications service, is available and affordable. With this context, it becomes plain that allegations of infringement against one member of a family should never be enough to cut that entire household off from internet access, just as private allegations of law-breaking in other areas should not compel other utility companies to cut off users from water or power. Nevertheless, Section 512(a) is sometimes interpreted as requiring that internet service providers create, advertise, and execute policies that do exactly that, and this is sorely in need of revision.</p><p>Perhaps no sections of the DMCA have aged as poorly as those which apply the termination requirement of Section 512(i) to broadband providers. Internet service providers have two distinct functions: the interactive component that connects a user to the broader internet, and the physical component (i.e. the last-mile wire) that carries the traffic. The internet service providers that Congress referred to in 1998 were services such as America Online and CompuServe, operated over the physical infrastructure of the telephone network. In short, ISPs in 1998 were edge services in a competitive market, accessed via a regulated common carrier. There was no need to even discuss the underlying telecommunications provider, let alone attach liability; nobody suggested that the phone network could be liable for copyright infringement.</p><p>In 2020, however, the software and infrastructural aspects of connecting to the internet have merged; modern ISPs both 'route traffic and own the cable (or fiber) over which the traffic flows. This radically alters the stakes of \"subscriber termination\" for accusations of repeat infringement. In 1998, termination from an internet service provider meant uninstalling AOL and signing up for a subscription from any number of competitive providers; many markets had several, and users could dial in to other online services, such as bulletin board systems, as well. By contrast, in 2020, more than 100 million Americans live in homes serviced by only one broadband provider. n46 According to the FCC's 2018 Internet Access Services report, 73% of census blocks have access to at most two broadband providers at 25 Mbps downstream, with that number jumping to 98% at 100 Mbps speeds. n47 In general, while broadband deployment and speeds improve marginally over time, broadband competition does not. Truly high-speed wired broadband is only feasible over fiber and coaxial cable -- the DSL providers who once provided a level of competition to cable are increasingly irrelevant, and mobile broadband remains a complement, not a substitute, to wired household broadband for the vast majority of users. Thus, for most people, getting cut off from a broadband provider means losing the kind of internet access necessary for school, work, and health care applications, among other things. If you are lucky, you may be able to access severely reduced capabilities via a mobile connection. Unfortunately, if you are one of the 42 million Americans without access to wired or fixed wireless connections at all, and thus, entirely rely on mobile or satellite connectivity, n48 well, you're just out of luck.</p><p>It is an open question whether a modern-day internet service provider even needs a liability shield, since it is not clear that the act of providing broadband access should ever give rise to any form of secondary liability a provider needs to be shielded from. Nor does the law specify how ISPs are supposed to obtain knowledge of repeat infringers -- they are not required to accept DMCA takedown notices, as other online service providers are, since they do not actually host any material. Nor do they (or should they) have a general duty to monitor and track their users' activity. For copyright purposes, it makes sense to view modern-day ISPs as service</p><p>BroadbandNow Study Indicates 42 Million Do Not Have Access, BroadbandNow (February 3, 2020), <url normalizedValue=\"https://broadbandnow.com/research/fcc-underest.imat.es-nnserved-bv-50-percent.providers\">https://broadbandnow.com/research/fcc-underest.imat.es-nnserved-bv-50-percent.providers</url> closer in kind to the power company that powers a user's computer, than to a file-sharing service or streaming site.</p><p>Also worth noting is the different role that internet access -- specifically, broadband access -- plays in life in 2020, compared to its role in 1998. Today, individuals use broadband to work remotely, attend classes, access critical medical care, consume essential news and information, and socialize. First responders use broadband to communicate life-saving information to local residents, and small- to medium -size businesses use broadband to access global markets that are critical to staying afloat. n49 This cannot be reconciled with the broad interpretation of Section 512(i) as requiring that service providers (including ISPs) adopt policies that provide for the termination of subscribers upon repeat accusations of infringement. n50 By terminating a subscriber's account with their broadband provider, this policy would cut off households from not just copyrighted content, but from everything.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Two hundred and twenty-nine million American adults live their lives online under the shadow cast by Section 512. This push for reform, which would be difficult in a good year, comes at a time when we are all attempting to navigate uncharted waters. Whatever the risks, whatever the rewards, we cannot be reckless in our approach. Congress must acknowledge that this debate is not happening in a vacuum, and reject the reduction of stakeholders down to the strawmen of \"big tech\" and \"content.\" Broadband access, algorithmic governance, and economic incentive structures all impact Americans' ability to speak online. In a moment of massive social change, we must not take that for granted.</p><p>n1 U.S. Census Bureau, QuickFacts: United States, (last visited June 1, 2020),<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfact.s/fact./table/US/PST045219\">https://www.census.gov/quickfact.s/fact./table/US/PST045219</url> (The total U.S. population is estimated at 328,239,523; 77.6%, or 254,713,870 are over 18.); Monica Anderson, Andrew Perrin, Jingjing Jiang and Madhumitha Kumar, 10% of Americans Don't Use the Internet.

I am honored to testify on their behalf.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">US Inventor is an organization that works to educate Congress and America in general about the damage that 15 years of errant patent reform has brought on inventors and startups. We are advocating for legislation to improve the patent system so that inventors can attract investment to to commercialize their inventions. This has the effect of creating jobs, stimulating economic growth, and protecting our national and economic security by keeping America in the global lead of technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, patents are useless to the very entities the patent system was created to help... inventors and patent-based startups. The vast majority of patents held by inventors and startups cannot be defended due to massive fundamental changes to the patent system at all levels.</p><p>Over the past fifteen years, the \"government has changed rules and laws in prior art scope, invention priority, injunction conditions, litigation venue, patent construction, error correction, enabling disclosure requirements, expanded mental step doctrine, abstract idea doctrine, invalidation procedures etc. to make sure that patent applicants will not get patents, patent applications will be denied, granted patents will be invalidated, survived patents cannot be enforced, patents in suit will get less or no damages, and patent owners are thrown out of court or rewarded with liabilities.\" n1 Many of these changes were results of the Supreme Court legislating new patent laws with no supporting law without public debate. n2</p><p>These changes have virtually all gone on the direction of harming small inventors and startups making our patents undefendable. It is an economic fact that a patent that cannot be defended, cannot attract investment. With stagnant investment into startups, n3 our primary job creation engine is stagnant. n4</p><p>Most inventors lack a means of voicing their objections due to lack of organization, funding, knowledge, relationships or experience. Many are just too busy inventing to pay attention. For most, the damage remains unknown until they attempt to either commercialize or license their inventions, and then find it impossible protect their invention in the market it created. Worse, if they defend their patented invention, they will burn millions of dollars and are often forced to forfeit the patents for lack of resources. Thus, lawmakers and courts do not hear their objections and continue with more and more damaging reforms.</p><p>Of the changes made in the last 15 years, three are the most violent to the rights of inventors and startups: The America Invents Act (AIA) created the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), which invalidates 84% of challenged patents; eBay v MercExchange effectively eliminated injunctive relief; and the subject of this hearing, Alice v CLS Bank let loose a demon called the \"abstract idea\" that has no definition and is invalidating 67% of challenged patents.</p><p>But, many multinational corporations are testifying as themselves and testifying through proxies of their lobbying organizations. For example, the High-Tech Inventors Association, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the Internet Association are funded by and act as a voice for Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and other big tech monopolies, all of which benefit from weak patent protection.</p><p>US Inventor represents inventors inventing technology to compete with these big tech monopolies, yet we combined have only one voice and only five minutes of oral testimony for all of us.</p><p>The big tech monopoly has more than 100 minutes via direct and proxy testimony before this subcommittee, at least 20 times that of US inventors' 5 minutes.</p><p>Of the 45 entities testifying in these hearings on Section 101, it appears that US Inventor is providing the only patented inventor, and certainly the only patented inventor who used patents to attract investment to start up a company commercializing the patents.</p><p>This unfairly equips big corporations with an outsized voice in influencing patent law for their own benefit. It skews due diligence performed by Congress and will push legislation to favor big corporations at the expense of all others, including US inventors.</p><p>US Inventor recommend that more inventors be allowed to testify so that Congress can fully understand the plight of inventors and startups under the current gutted patent system.</p><p>False political narratives</p><p>False political narratives condense complicated issues into an object and then villainize the object. Once a villain is created, its evil can be expanded to encompass anything you don't like. When you have pushed enough bad stuff into the moniker, you can simply state its evil name, add a few campaign contributions, and Congress will magically pass laws in your favor to kill the villain.</p><p>Two false political narratives: one called a \"patent troll\" n5 and the other called a \"bad patent\" n6, have been created to weaken patent rights for inventors and startups. Hundreds of millions of dollars to push these false narratives into public and political discourse, and to drive self-serving changes to patent law in the courts, the USPTO, the DOJ, the FTC, and in Congress.</p><p>The result is that the patent system has been turned on its head. Inventors are now villains called \"patent trolls\" simply because they assert their hard-earned patent rights (now called \"bad patents\") against big tech monopolies who steal these inventions. False statistics and analysis paid for by multinationals infringers shore up this huge lie. n7 This cunning theme suggests that our national innovation ecosystem is somehow fostered by infringement of patented technologies belonging to startups and inventors by big corporations who have huge market resources and deep pockets and can massively commercialize them.</p><p>The halls of Congress are infected with stories explaining how \"bad patents\" destroy innovation. Big corporations demand that Congress preserve Supreme Court legislated exceptions to Section 101 subject matter eligibility, and that USPTO Director Iancu revert back to previous PTAB rules because both kill \"bad patents\" and this is the only way to protect us from evil \"patent trolls\". n8</p><p>We live in a global economy, so actions taken here have counteracting actions abroad. China watched as we weakened our patent system and responded by strengthening theirs. n9 The AIA was made law in 2011, which dramatically weakened patent protection for inventors. Not coincidentally, China began strengthening their own patent system the same year. n10 By 2015, nearly twice as many patents were filed in China (1,101,864) than in the U.S (589,410). n11 Venture capital is fleeing to China as a result. n12 Not surprisingly, \"In 2015, about 12,000 new companies were founded each day in China and the number of newly registered companies grew to 4.4 million with a growth rate of 21.6% year-on-year.\" n13 By 2016, U.S. startups were at a 40 year low. n14 In the U.S., the number of angel and seed stage funding rounds dropped 62 percent in the first quarter of 2017. n15</p><p>Clearly, venture capital, startups, new technologies and jobs are moving to China and that movement directly maps to the destruction of the U.S. patent system and China's response of strengthening their own patent system.</p><p>And China continues to strengthen their patent system. In July 2017, China's President Xi Jinping said \"Wrongdoing should be punished more severely so that IP infringers will pay a heavy price.\" n16 China launched an appeals court for patents in late 2018. n17 The newly established IP Court is intended to function very similarly to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, with a national jurisdiction over technical civil IP cases as well as appeals of patent validity decisions.</p><p>Certainly, China sees that their patent system is valuable to China's 2025 Initiative because it attracts investment into startups in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, smart appliances, high tech ships and aerospace, medical devices, agricultural equipment and more. These industries are either fully implemented in software, or products in these industries are enabled by software.</p><p>On our side of the Pacific, the effect of weakening the protection of a property right is to crash its value, and patent values have plummeted by as much as 60% according to several studies by economists based on public sales and licenses. n18 In the last five years, the gross value of patent sales is down 83%, the number of patents sold is down nearly 50%, and the average price per patent is down about 55%. n19 New patent suits have dropped by as much as 40% in one year. n20 Most of that drop is in software inventions, n21 a very important American industry that feeds innovation in every other industry, and an industry critical to our economic and national security. n22</p><p>We are on the cusp of a substantial economic shock. To remain compliant with Sarbanes Oxley, public companies are required to adjust the value of patent assets held on their books to the current fractional values. n23 Collectively, these companies may be forced to write down trillions of dollars in patent assets from their books. n24 Asset write-downs on this scale have the potential to crash the economy and send the U.S. economy into recession.</p><p>While the loss of economic growth and job creation is bad enough, the loss of our technological lead will prove devastating to our national security. Entire new fields of technology are now controlled by Chinese firms. n25 We are seeing this unfold right now as Huawei has taken the lead in 5G dispatching 5G capable smartphones long before Apple. We will soon be in the thick a national security disaster as the U.S. is forced to purchase technologies critical to our infrastructure and military from the most powerful communist nation on earth, the Chinese.</p><p>What are \"Patent Trolls\"?</p><p>Some characterize \"patent trolls\" as rich investors who hijack n26 patents from inventors. Then, while providing no societal value, these \"patent trolls\" are viewed as extorting billions of dollars from small businesses and threatening RandD-related value creation based on the patent. n27 n28 Others describe \"patent trolls\" as lying in wait for the market to develop on an invention, and then sneaking up and attacking unsuspecting infringers. n29</p><p>Confusingly, some even allege that \"patent trolls\" actually invent new technologies themselves and then they patent it. n30</p><p>Except for the last curious characterization, the figures supporting these characterizations are false and unprovable. The Wall Street Journal exposed that Google paid seemingly credible academic institutions to produce fake reports. n31 In other reporting, the underlying data, and the conclusions based on that data, come from biased sources with vested interests in a weak patent system. n32 n33 Often, the underlying data is secreted making it impossible for others to verify the findings. n34 For example, one widely publicized report attacking the quality of patents owned by \"patent trolls\" states that ~90% of cases brought by so-called \"patent trolls\" lose when brought to court. n35 This report is highly disputed with contrary evidence showing virtually no difference between \"patent troll\" owned patents and all others. n36 Another report by Boston University attacking the societal cost of \"patent trolls\" states that the \"direct accrued costs\" of \"patent trolls\" was $29B in 2011 and that this is somehow a bad thing. n37 This report is frequently cited despite that the \"direct accrued cost\" actually represents perfectly legitimate and often voluntary licenses paid to patent holders for the use of their patented technologies. n38 In another widely used and misleading report, the number of lawsuits filed by so-called \"patent trolls\" has tripled from 29% to 62% since 2011. n39 The actual increase is near zero; the cited numerical increase is a direct result of rule changes in the AIA, which forced suits against multiple infringers to be filed separately. n40 In other words, the AIA forced the most compelling statistic supporting anti-troll legislation - case count - to move significantly up, thereby creating a false basis supporting a new round of anti-troll legislation.</p><p>Notably, reports where the underlying data is made publicly available contradict the reports where data is secreted. The truth is, even if there is a real problem with a few people abusing the system, the economic impact is far lower than claimed and is no different than has been the case for over 200 years. n41 The risk associated with such misconceptions is that the proposed cure may be worse than the disease or may even kill the patient. n42</p><p>These false reports have been kept alive by big tech lobbyists. Julie Samuels of Google and other big tech funded Engine Advocacy testified under oath \"it has been estimated that patent trolls cost the U.S. economy at least $29 billion per year\". n43 As discussed previously, this is the Boston University School of Law report by professors James Bessen and Michael Meurer n44 that has been widely debunked as fake research likely paid for by Google. The danger is that a falsehood repeated enough times will become a credible perception of truth, as seems to have become the case. It is ironic that the definitions used to describe \"patent trolls\" actually describe individual inventors, universities, small patent-based businesses, practicing companies and other legitimate patent holders who legally and rightfully enforce their hard-earned patent rights. n45 n46 n47 n48 n49 n50 n51</p><p>What are \"Bad Patents\"?</p><p>Big tech lobbyists define a \"bad patent\" n52 as a \"trivial variation,\" an \"abstract building block or technology,\" or \"so poorly written that it's impossible to understand what it covers.\" It is an emotional argument conjuring up feelings of anger and righteous indignation because \"bad patents\" are used to shake down innocent multinational corporations for something as inconsequential as patent infringement.</p><p>But what makes a \"bad patent\" bad? The answer should be found through logic and reason, not emotion and righteousness. Because patents are economic instruments, there must be a net negative economic effect for a patent to be \"bad.\" The reasonable question should ask if the patent creates a negative economic effect that is greater than its positive economic effect.</p><p>Fortunately, in February 2019 big tech gave the Senate Judiciary IP Subcommittee's Section 101 roundtable some examples of \"bad patents\": a method of proposing marriage n53, a method of swinging on a swing n54, and Amazon's one-click patent n55.</p><p>Do these patents have a net negative economic effect. (If you want to see more \"bad patents\" they are available at the Electronic Frontier Foundation n56, or Patent Progress n57, both of which are big tech lobbyists masquerading as nonprofits.)</p><p>The Positive Economic Effect of Patents</p><p>All three patents were examined by the USPTO. The method of proposing marriage was not issued, but Amazon's one-click patent and the swinging on a swing patent were both issued.</p><p>In all three, the USPTO was paid examination fees. In two, the USPTO was paid maintenance fees. It is likely that all three hired patent professionals in the economy. All were disclosed to the public, so others were able to advance the art by inventing around or improving it.</p><p>Therefore, all three have the positive economic effects of funding the USPTO, hiring patent professionals and advancing the art.</p><p>The Negative Economic Effect of Litigating Patents</p><p>Around 97% of patents are never litigated because they are either not commercially viable (not useful), thus not infringed, or not commercially valuable, thus damages are too small to return the cost of litigation. But when a patent is commercially viable and valuable, and it is litigated, both sides expend resources and experience uncertainty, which are highly disruptive to their businesses.</p><p>While both parties experience negative economic effects in litigation, in most cases the infringer is a resource-rich multinational corporation, and the patent holder is a resource-starved small entity: an independent inventor, a startup or an investor, or sometimes a non-practicing entity (NPE) acting on their behalf. Due to this resource asymmetry, the negative economic effects are by far more severe for the patent holder than for the large infringing corporation.</p><p>A patent is a booklet of paper, so it is a simple fact that a patent does not cause litigation. The infringer can cause it by the act of infringing, or the patent holder can cause it by asserting the patent outside its scope. However, the patent itself does nothing and therefore cannot be attributed negative economic effects.</p><p>This fact alone means that there can be no \"bad patents.\" However, since many seem to have accepted the false narrative of \"bad patents\" running around destroying innovation, let's investigate further.</p><p>The Infringer's Negative Economic Effect</p><p>Many years before a patent is issued, most patent applications are published on the USPTO website. All patents are also published there. The USPTO has a patent search engine, as does Google, so anyone can find patents relevant to their business simply by searching the USPTO website or Google Patents.</p><p>Patent infringement is illegal, so anyone in business has a duty to identify patents that they may infringe to avoid breaking the law.</p><p>That means that if a patent is litigated within the scope of its claims against an infringing product, the infringer knew (or should have known) the patent existed and that their product was infringing. Therefore, the infringer caused litigation by the act of infringing, thus the negative economic effects must be attributed to the infringer.</p><p>When a large competitor infringes a startup's patent, the startup has no good choices. It can sue the infringer, but that means it must divert already scarce resources into litigation and away from business activities like engineering, marketing, sales, etc. Resources burned in litigation may never be recovered because loss rates for patent holders are unreasonably high.</p><p>Since eBay v MercExchange n58, injunctive relief is restricted, so in the unlikely event the startup wins the infringement suit, the court will grant a compulsory license, not an injunction. The resource-starved startup will be forced to compete with the resource-rich infringer. Due to resource asymmetry and a very real risk that the infringer will use their deep pockets and existing market power to take the market and kill the startup, the startup will have difficulty attracting investment. When a startup sues an infringer, the startup may very well fail, whether it wins the infringement case or loses.</p><p>Many startups ignore infringement. They accept that they are forced to compete against a large infringer, but least they won't have to divert resources to litigation. But for the same asymmetrical reasons, the startup will have difficulty attracting investment and is at risk of being run out of business.</p><p>The negative economic effects caused by infringement are damaging not only to the infringed startup, but also our nation's innovation engine and our national security. When startups die and their investors lose money, investors invest in places where they get better protection, like China.</p><p>The \"patent troll\" narrative attributes all negative economic effects to the patent holder regardless of the cause of litigation even though the infringer is the sole party who can avoid the act of infringement. The patent holder cannot avoid the act of infringement. In fact, the patent holder attempted to discourage infringement by filing for patent protection. The negative economic effects of infringement must be attributed to the infringer and law should recognize this by discouraging infringement with injunctive relief, low costs and quick resolutions.</p><p>The Patent Holder's Negative Economic Effect</p><p>If a patent is litigated outside the scope of the claims, and thereby against a non-infringing product, the patent owner caused litigation. Thus, the negative economic effects must be attributed to the patent holder.</p><p>The negative economic effects to businesses that have been wrongly sued for patent infringement have been made known, so they need not be regurgitated here. Unfortunately, the overreaction by Congress, the USPTO and courts has wiped out patent protection for small entities.</p><p>\"Bad Patents\" Have a Positive Economic Effect</p><p>The method of proposing marriage was never issued. It was a patent application, so it can never be litigated and therefore can't produce a negative economic effect. This big tech example of a \"bad patent\" is nothing but a disingenuous attempt to sway Congress with false information.</p><p>Nobody sues anyone without a potential damages award because money spent litigating will never be returned. No damages can be calculated for a method of swinging on a swing because nobody is making any money doing it. Since there could be no damages awarded, money spent litigating would not be returned. This patent was never litigated, and the example is another disingenuous attempt to sway Congress.</p><p>But what about the \"bad patents\" that big tech says are too trivial to warrant patenting, like Amazon's one-click?</p><p>Nobody can invent anything without improving what already exists, so all inventions are in some way an improvement. Sometimes, a trivial improvement becomes the primary factor differentiating the marketability of one product over another. Amazon's one-click patent was a trivial improvement that had a significant market effect. It made the buying experience on Amazon's site better than that of Amazon's competitors, thereby drawing customers to Amazon's site and away from competitors. It is one of the early reasons that Amazon got ahead of its competitors and therefore became the outrageously successful company it has become.</p><p>Amazon's one-click patent did not affect its competitors' products. Their customers could still use them just as they did prior to the one-click patent. Therefore, Amazon's patent did not have a negative economic effect on any technology already on the market. But it had a significant effect on the marketability of Amazon's products, which is an advancement of the art and a positive economic effect.</p><p>The mistake the \"bad patent\" narrative makes is arguing that a patent is a technical instrument not an economic instrument. Yes, a patent discloses advancements in technology, so patents are technical instruments. And yes, most of these advancements are trivial from the perspective of technology. But many are not trivial in their market effect, thus patents are more of an economic instrument than they are a technical instrument.</p><p>Nobody does the hard work and spends money writing and filing a patent for the sheer joy of advancing technology. People do it to improve their lot in life. They do it for profit. A patent is an instrument of profit, which makes it an economic instrument. It must be treated as such to encourage people to advance technology by filing patents.</p><p>The degree to which an invention improves the mountain of technology on which we live is not important for any given invention. It is the accumulation of many trivial improvements that is important, because some trivial improvements may turn out to be very important. For example, Edison's lightbulb was a trivial improvement from a technical perspective. All he really figured out was that a carbonized thread used as a filament would last long enough to create a marketable lightbulb. But everything else in a light bulb already existed, even filaments. He just advanced filament technology a little bit with a carbonized thread.</p><p>If we buy into the big tech \"bad patent\" narrative and agree that only big inventions should be worthy of patenting, there will be fewer trivial inventions. But we will never get a critical mass of trivial inventions needed for that one that matters, like a carbonized thread filament.</p><p>We will have to subjectively decide which inventions are significant enough to deserve a patent. Who can answer that question? Certainly not a patent examiner, and I don't think we have any former Soviet central planners employed at the USPTO. Maybe we should do what we have for the last two plus centuries and let the market decide. After all, if the invention is so trivial that the market does not adopt it, there can be no litigation and therefore no negative economic effects.</p><p>Just as the false \"patent troll\" narrative wrongly villainized early stage investors as greedy rent seekers, the false \"bad patent\" narrative wrongly considers patents to be technical instruments, ignoring all positive economic effects and wrongly attributing all negative economic effects to the patent instead of to the party causing the infringement.</p><p>Both false narratives dangerously teach a fundamental misunderstanding of how patents achieve their Constitutional mandate to \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.\" Without correcting this misunderstanding of patents, we are doomed to endure the same bad public policy.</p><p>The Damage is Targeted at Tech Startups</p><p>Anti-troll legislation, court decisions and administrative rule making, while targeted at fake \"patent trolls\" and \"bad patents\" has damaged the U.S. patent system gutting it for inventors and startups - the very people the U.S. patent system purports to help. Curiously, large multinational corporations are still able to enforce their patents against small entities. Some have cynically observed that perhaps the unintended consequences are intended.</p><p>In a report which studied the period immediately following Alice Corp v. CLS Bank, a 28% drop in patent lawsuits compared to the same period in 2013 (July 1 to October 31) is observed. n59 This drop hits hardest in two critical areas. First, 88% of that decrease is attributed to non-practicing entities (NPE) or so-called \"patent trolls\", n60 which are defined as patent holders who do not commercialize an invention, but instead license the invention to others who commercialize it. While this definition encompasses individual inventors, patent-based startups, research labs and universities, it also encompasses entities that acquire patents and enforce them - NPE's.</p><p>The later, NPE's, make up the secondary market for patent assets and a critical part of the patent economy. Inventors can sell their patents directly to NPE's so they can continue inventing. This is a critical outlet because few inventors can effectively commercialize an invention either due to personal disposition or personal desire. Those inventors who wish to commercialize the invention can collateralize patents to attract investment to commercialize the invention. If the company fails, investors often take control of the collateralized patents and either become an NPE and enforce the patents, or they sell the patents to an NPE to return their initial investment and go on investing in other startups.</p><p>This secondary market of investors and NPE's is critical to a healthy patent system and critical to the capitalization of startups that bring the next big technology to market, thus driving our economy and creating jobs. While NPE's are the target of multinational patent reforms, damaging NPE's not only harms inventors and startups, but it also harms the economy overall and U.S. job creation.</p><p>Second, the number of software patent lawsuits filed was down 42% in the period from July 1 to October 31 of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013. n61 The drop in lawsuits directly affects software patents more than any other technology. At the same time, software inventions are used nearly everywhere, from your personal computer to your refrigerator, and from your smart phone to your tennis shoes and even the buttons on your shirt. Since 2011, software related inventions accounted for over 50% of all U.S. patents issued. n62</p><p>Software is a primary area of innovation simply because it is an essential element relevant to nearly everything made today, regardless of whether that software innovation is the actual product or is manifested in an enhancement to a product. When a product does not use software directly, it is software that controls how the product is engineered, manufactured, distributed, financed, marketed, sold and serviced. The software industry created 3.65 million U.S. jobs and contributed $526B to our GDP in 2012, and it is growing at 50%. n63 Software is one of the greatest American industries and one where, as it stands today, America leads the rest of the world.</p><p>Despite the importance of software to our economy, eliminating software patenting is the target of big tech lobbying by aiming reforms to prevent creative individuals and startups from beating the industry tech giants to the punch. Big tech corporations have deep pockets, lots of programmers, market dominance and sticky customers. Inventors have none of these advantages. Yet, while large tech corporations have successfully silenced inventors and tilted patent law in their favor with hundreds of millions dollars of political spending in the last decade, n64 they are still not satisfied and seek to maintain the past reforms and advance their anti-patent agenda with more reforms.</p><p>Software innovation will likely continue for decades and may never end. However, if American software inventors cannot protect new ideas (as is the case today), whether the U.S. continues to lead the world in tech is in question. The U.S. risks being displaced as China and the rest of the world has been strengthening their patent systems. n65 These positive changes are stimulating innovation in those countries and growing their economies.</p><p>The U.S., unfortunately, is going in the opposite direction.</p><p>We are weakening patent protection. It's not surprising that since the creation of the \"patent troll\" myth and the corporate push for patent reform began in the late 1990's, n66 the number of technology related startups in the U.S. is down nearly 40%. n67</p><p>If we continue down this anti-patent road, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in critical infrastructure and military technologies. China will.</p><p>It is important to understand that degrading patent protection for software effects all other types of patents equally. Today medical related patents are damaged in the same way and to the same extent. In fact, some medical research companies have stopped research of key medical related technologies, such as Ebola treatments, in part because patented inventions cannot be protected. n68</p><p>Because software is increasingly integrated in almost everything we use, it is a dangerous path to separate patent law related to software from patent laws related to other technologies. IoT (Internet of Things) is a prime example of this separation problem. IoT is integrating virtually everything we use into a network you control. Home appliances like your washer, dryer, refrigerator, stove, dish washer, security system, furnace, air conditioning system, television, cars, and much more, many yet to be invented, are being interconnected into systems and networks you can control from your smart phone and elsewhere. Software at every level (operating systems, embedded code, applications, etc.) and of every type (GPS, wireless, phone apps, computer apps, etc.) are integrated with these devices. This software development is critical to development of this new and exciting industry. Separating software patent laws from the rest of patent law will destroy investment in new software technologies critical to the development of the IoT market, and therefore impede the development of the entire industry.</p><p>Congress, the administration and the courts all see that the patent system as broken. They are right. It is broken. But not for the reasons they think. The facts have been hijacked by the loud impermeable voices of a few big tech multinational corporations who benefit from weak patent rights. Those negatively affected, the inventors and the American public, cannot get a word in edgewise. If we continue to enact broad changes under the misguided \"patent troll\" arguments, we can expect even greater damage to our economy, our standing in the world and our national security.</p><p>We must go the other way. We must stop weakening the U.S. patent system and we must return it to what it was just 15 years ago.</p><p>Why is the U.S. Patent System Gutted for Inventor and Startups?</p><p>Today, actions taken by all three branches of government have destroyed the patent system for small entities.</p><p>* In 2006, the Supreme Court in eBay v. MercExchange n69 effectively eliminated the exclusive right of a patent. The result is that an inventor cannot exclude others from using their invention because an inventor must prove injunctive relief is in the public interest, an impossibly difficult thing to prove. Proving that the public interest is served by granting an injunction against an infringer effectively requires proving that denying the public of the infringer's product does not deny the public access to the invention. To accomplish this, the patent holder effectively must have a product on the market to replace the infringing product.</p><p>But startups fail at rates of 90%. n70 Often the reason is competition from large incumbents. n71 Since eBay, if an incumbent believes they can capture the market and kill the startup, they have no fear of injunctive relief.</p><p>When the startup fails, investors often take control of the patents and use the patents to recoup their investment. When an investor evaluates a company before investing, patents are valued for this likelihood. Investors estimate the value of a patent based on what they believe the overall market will be for products implementing patent. This market value then leads them to a reasonable estimate of the value of the patent within that market. For example, if a patent can be projected to create a ten-million-dollar market, it can be reasonably valued at some percentage of that market, perhaps 3% to 5% of the total market, or a potential value of $300,000 to $500,000. That number then helps justify the investment.</p><p>However, this evaluation only works in a free market. If the startup fails, the investor does not have a product, under eBay the investor will not be able to satisfy the public interest test to enjoin the infringer. A compulsory license is the only remaining remedy with an arbitrary value set by a liberal arts major in a robe with no business experience in the technology or the market.</p><p>Estimating a patent's future value for investment at the earliest stages of commercialization becomes a wild guess. It is not possible to forecast what value a court will place on the patent years in the future. So establishing a value on the patent is impossible and much too risky to justify investment, so most investors put their money elsewhere. This effect is a primary reason that funding for startups is falling.</p><p>The only place in the U.S. Constitution to use the word \"Right\" is Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8: \"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries\". The \"exclusive Right\" is the very essence of a property right, so the effect of eBay is to redefine a private property right as a public entitlement subject the public interest, much like food stamps or a driver's license.</p><p>The natural economic effect of eBay is to encourage potential infringers to steal the invention, and using existing market power and deep pockets, saturate the market with infringing products. eBay discourages settlement of infringement cases because the loss to the infringer can be delayed by litigation, and many small inventors cannot sustain litigation costs. It is a better business decision to litigate the inventor into oblivion or capitulation with an arbitrary or minimal settlement. Indeed, attorneys advise their infringing clients to do exactly that. n72</p><p>But the most critical failure of eBay is to devalue all patents at the earliest stages of commercialization, thus damaging funding to startups commercializing our most important technologies.</p><p>* In 2011, Congress passed the America Invents Act (AIA) n73 and destroyed any Presumption of Validity by creating three procedures to invalidate issued patents in an administrative tribunal called the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). n74 Prior to the AIA, a patent had a strong Presumption of Validity in black letter law much like any other property right. n75 Only an Article III court could invalidate an issued patent. This was done in an adversarial process. A showing of clear and convincing evidence, the highest standard in U.S. law, of a failure to meet statutory requirements of patentability was required. The burden to prove this failure was on the party seeking to invalidate the patent. Only a party to the suit could ask a court to invalidate the patent.</p><p>The AIA changed all that by flipping each construct upside down. The PTAB is an administrative tribunal that presumes a patent invalid and is set up for the expressed purposes of invalidating patents. A PTAB procedure is initiated by showing the lowest level of evidence in U.S. law - more likely than not. n76 An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), under the Executive Branch of the government, presides over a process to re-validate the patent under a \"broadest reasonable interpretation\" of the claims. The burden to prove again that the patent is valid is placed on the inventor. PTAB turns patent law on its head n77 by treating a property right like a government entitlement more similar to food stamps than property rights.</p><p>PTAB procedures were established with the clear purpose of increasing the probability that a patent will be found invalid. Today, PTAB procedures invalidate patents at rates more than 84%. n78 There is no longer any Presumption of Validity as required in 35 USC 282 in practice, and the cost of proving and reproving the patent valid is an enormous and often unsurmountable burden on the inventor. n79</p><p>Just a single PTAB procedure, costing the petitioner around $20,000, can cost the patent holder as much as $1,050,000. n80 If the petition for a PTAB procedure is denied, about 75% of the cost is returned to the petitioner. PTAB procedures have no estoppel and another PTAB procedure can be filed if the current PTAB procedure fails to invalidate the patent. Multiple PTAB procedures from multiple petitioners, often on the very same prior art already reviewed by the USPTO during examination, are being launched one after another by infringers to keep the infringement case in court stayed, to drive patent holder costs to untenable levels, and, playing the odds, to eventually invalidate every claim. One patent holder suffered 125 separate PTAB procedures against just 10 patents until all of the claims in all of the patents were invalidated. n81</p><p>Unlike litigation in court, PTAB litigation does not end with financial settlement or a license agreement. The patent holder is fighting solely to preserve the patent right. Therefore, investors or contingency attorneys will not help because the risk of losing is extraordinarily high with no hope of any payout. This leaves most patent holders with no access to money other than what they have themselves, so an infringer can easily drive the patent holder into financial ruin succeeding based on access to money alone.</p><p>Anyone can petition for a PTAB procedure, and remain anonymous. In fact, several new companies were founded for the sole purpose of initiating PTAB procedures against third party patents. n82 Often, these companies engage in extortion-like activities asking for licenses that they can sell to infringing companies or a cut of future settlements in exchange for dropping the PTAB procedure. n83 n84 Other third parties are leveraging these PTAB procedures to force patent holders in settlements that pay nothing to the patent holder. n85 The same large multinational corporations who lobbied to pass the AIA, which created the PTAB in the first place, fund these PTAB extortion companies. n86 In a different twist on PTAB abuse, the founder of Dallas-based Hayman Capital Management, L.P. challenged 15 key drug patents to PTAB procedures. While it seems unlikely that a hedge fund would want to harm drug companies, short selling stock then filing PTAB procedures against key patents to crash the stock price could make the hedge fund millions of dollars. n87</p><p>A single PTAB procedure can burn five or more years of the patent's enforceable life, or about 30%. During the pendency of the PTAB procedure, most courts stay litigation until the PTAB procedure resolves, and it is not possible to start litigation against new infringers. n88 That lost time is not added back to the patents term. It is just lost altogether, which substantially devalues the patent.</p><p>The PTAB is a politically driven administrative tribunal. Administrative law judge's have no code of conduct n89. Their chain of command ends with the President. The presidency is by its very nature a political office.</p><p>Any President can strengthen or weaken patent rights by changing PTAB rules and by passing down policy through chain of command to administrative law judges. Thus, every election brings with it the likelihood that patent rights will be made either stronger or weaker and this could happen every four years.</p><p>American politics is heavily influenced by political contributions of large corporations. This means that patents will forever be a political football due to political influence. A property rights system subjected to this degree of political influence will never be stable.</p><p>The common denominator of poorly performing economies is weak property rights. In banana republics, the dictator arbitrarily determines the strength of property rights based on political favoritism. It is impossible to forecast if any particular property right will be weakened in the future. In these environments, virtually no one will invest in property to improve it, and property goes unimproved.</p><p>The PTAB effectively grants the Executive Branch dictatorial power of one of our nation's most important property rights. The value of a patent cannot be known because of the very real risk that the unelected political appointee with the power to make patents weak or strong will change in four years or less. That means investors cannot invest in early stage startups because the risk is too high.</p><p>* The AIA forced patent suits against similarly situated infringers to be filed separately. Independent of that, the Supreme Court in a case called TC Heartland v Kraft defined the term \"reside\" for the purposes of venue to mean the state where a company is incorporated. Now patent infringement cases must be filed in the state of the infringer. Unfortunately, there is no counterbalancing provision that allows a patent holder to sue an infringer where the patent holder resides.</p><p>For the most significant inventions that we as a nation want invented here, those with the greatest commercial success that have created or significantly improved entire industries, particularly those in technology, there are often dozens or even hundreds of infringers, and these infringers often reside in a dozen or more states. In these cases where there are dozens of infringers, TC Heartland means that patent suits should be filed in the state where the defendant is incorporated, so similarly situated patent infringement cases could end up scattered across a dozen or more states.</p><p>Managing this complexity and cost will be prohibitive for all but a few inventions. Certainly the logistics will become impossibly difficult and costs will skyrocket as each court will require local counsel, and the inventor, technical and damages experts, and lawyers will need to travel to each court multiple times. But the real problem comes when different courts find different answers to the same questions of claim construction, validity and more. When any court finds something unfavorable to the inventor, all infringers in other courts will likely petition their court to adopt that decision. This will generate a cascade litigation in every court for virtually every decision. If decisions conflict, the resulting chaos will eventually need to be sorted out in the Federal Circuit causing multiple appeals. What happens when one court invalidates the patent? Do all the other courts adopt that same theory of invalidation? TC Heartland will bring litigation chaos to the most valuable inventions.</p><p>From a practical perspective, TC Heartland under the current venue laws means that many of the most valuable new technologies will very likely be unenforceable in the United States. These are the same technologies that construct our infrastructure and defense and create most of our new jobs.</p><p>* A patent can take more than 10 years of examination at the PTO before it is granted. n90 In one case, a patent application has been in examination for almost 40 years. n91 A patent term begins on the filing date and ends 20 years later. n92 In addition, a patent is a wasting asset and highly time sensitive. However, most of the time lost in examination is not added to the backend of the patent. It is just lost altogether. Many patents lose a large percentage of their life, and therefore a large percentage of their value, due to PTO delays. Some USPTO art groups allow less than 10% of patent applications. n93</p><p>* The Supreme Court in a case called Alice v. CLS Bank threw the definition of what is patentable subject matter under 35 USC 101 into chaos by creating an exception to 101 called the \"abstract idea\". However, the courts provided no definition of what constitutes an abstract idea.</p><p>Today nobody knows what is or isn't patentable, and this vacuum has brought the patent system to a screeching halt for technology inventors. No investor can reasonably assume that any patent will be held valid if challenged as an abstract idea, and 67.6% of those challenged are found abstract. n94</p><p>Many other Supreme Court decisions have slashed damages, eliminated obviousness tests and changed other long-standing tenets of patent law. Virtually all changes have damaged the ability of small entities to defend their patent rights against multinational corporations. The net effect has been to rip the floor out from inventors for the benefit of large moneyed corporations who steal inventions and to open the exit door for startups to move to China.</p><p>Paul Morinville's story is typical of thousands of inventors, so it can be used to illustrate how damage from the last 15 years of rapidly changing patent laws has destroyed US inventors and startups. It is critical to understand if Congress is going to fix this mess in a way that encourages startups capable of competing with big tech monopolies and other corporate giants. Since startups bring America most of its job growth and new technology, Congress should pay close attention to how patent law effects startups. A failure by Congress will thwart job creation, economic growth, new technology innovations, and our national security.</p><p>While Morinville worked for Dell through the 1990's, he invented what became the core enabling technology of enterprise middleware industry standards. He brought it to Dell management to build internally.</p><p>Dell executives thought so highly about the invention thattold him to start a company and they would fund it. He left Dell on April 3rd, 2000 with an agreement to fund his new startup after Dell helped me incorporate and file for patent protection.</p><p>The dot.com bubble crashed within two weeks of leaving Dell. Dell shut down Dell Ventures, which meant they would not fund Morinville's startup. But Dell executives set meetings with the top venture capitalists (VC) in Texas.</p><p>VC's thought it was a great invention and that it would certainly create a strong value proposition to customers. But the patent was pending and because the claims were not issued, they did not know what was protected. Therefore, they would not invest. But they said to come back when the patents issued.</p><p>It took seven years for the first patent to issue. So in 2007, Morinville went back to the same VC's. But by then the largest software companies on the planet were selling about $3 billion dollars of products infringing my patents. In 2006, a Supreme Court case called eBay v MercExchange had restricted injunctive relief. To be awarded injunctive relief, Morinville would have to prove it was in the public interest. But his startup did not have a product on the market, so passing a public interest test would be impossible. In other words, these big tech multinationals stole the invention and now they'll keep it.</p><p>So the VC's said that if they invested, they would be investing in a patent infringement lawsuit, which is not what they do. Morinville needed a lawyer not a VC.</p><p>Morinville found contingent fee attorney and began a licensing program. One company licensed my patents, but the rest of the companies ignored my communications. Morinville readied suits, but then Bilski v Kappos sent the patent system into chaos came in 2009 by requiring a machine or transformation test and Morinville's law firm stopped all licensing activity. No other attorneys would take the case due to uncertainty created by Bilski.</p><p>Finally, in 2010, Bilski was overturned. Later that year a CAFC case seemed to restore the patentability of tech patents.</p><p>In early 2011, Morinville sold one patent family to an investor who started licensing the patents. Proceeds from the licensing campaign funded the commercialization of the remaining inventions working with the Purdue Technology Center in MerrillvilleIndiana. Morinville was finally on the way to achieve the American Dream. Today, there should be 200 high tech jobs in GaryIndiana, one of the poorest areas in the country.</p><p>But in 2013, the results of the PTAB were made public. The kill rate of challenged patents was over 90%. This radically increased risk for Morinville's investors and they stop licensing my patents, which shut off funding.</p><p>Because Morinville was using my patents to fund my company, I was hit hard by the PTAB 90% kill rate earlier than others. The Supreme Court put a steak in its heart in 2014 when a decision called Alice v CLS Bank created an exception to the word \"any\" in Section 101 called the abstract idea.</p><p>In 2013, Morinville hopped in his truck, drove to Washington DC and started going door to door to educate Congress on the unintended consequences of the America Invents Act and to stop the Innovation Act.</p><p>Randy Landreneau joined Morinville and over the next two years, then pair sat in 67 Senate offices and over 350 House offices educating Congress about the unintended consequences of the AIA and the Innovation Act. The House pulled the Innovation Act off the floor. With the Innovation Act dead, its companion bill, the PATENT Act was introduced in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Morinville visited Iowa 40 counties educating Iowans of the unintended consequences that the PATENT Act would bring Iowa inventors and farmers. Senator Grassley abandoned the legislation shortly thereafter.</p><p>Over the next two years, Landreneau and Morinville educated inventor clubs building US Inventor to thousands of citizen activists.</p><p>At US Inventor, we are not inventors who assign our patent rights to big corporations. Nor are we the big corporate assignees masquerading as inventors. We are human beings, Americans, who patent our own inventions so that we can put food on our tables and send our kids to college by starting up companies. We are in almost every state and most congressional districts. We are unpaid volunteers who are not funded by any corporations. Instead we rely on small occasional donations from our citizen activists.</p><p>Our patents once encouraged investment that we needed to build our companies and compete in the market against the largest corporations, but that is no longer the case. n95</p><p>Last year, Randy Landreneau took the lead as President of US Inventor. Morinville now licenses the Chinese patents of an 83-year-old American woman inventor in China. The US counterparts of these patents have been wrongly invalidated by the PTAB as obvious on an IPR petition filed by Google at a time when the USPTO was ran by the former VP of Patent Strategy of Google, Michelle Lee.</p><p>But these patents stand in China. China's patent system is fast, inexpensive, and fair. n96 While it is not possible for American inventors to get their day in a US court n97, it is possible to get their day in a Chinese court. Congress could learn a lot from the Chinese.</p><p>Big tech multinationals operate on the thin outer edge of technology - the browser. The core technologies of their businesses are business methods, including page ranking algorithms (Google), \"like\" or \"friend\" buttons (Facebook), shopping carts (Amazon), online auctions (eBay), and many more.</p><p>Big tech business models are built on business methods, which can easily be made irrelevant in the eyes of consumers by a startup with better software or business method protected by a patent. Big tech cannot protect themselves from creative destruction served up by a startup with a presumed valid patent bearing an exclusive right. To protect their monopolies, big tech needed to destroy patents.</p><p>Other big tech companies assemble things like computers and routers with parts made from others. The big tech assembler often infringes on the patents of small inventors by directly infringing or by purchasing infringing products from foreign manufacturers. For these multinationals, crashing the patent system simply reduces the cost of stealing from small inventors.</p><p>Their fictional patent troll and false bad patent narratives have been very effective, gutting the patent system for those who could challenge their monopolies. The result is that big tech monopolies are untouchable because inventors with better tech cannot get investment to commercialize their inventions.</p><p>President Trump agrees. In April 2019, President Trump said in the NIST Green Paper on improving the Return on Investment (ROI) for federally funded RandD at page 69: \"The protection of IP rights is an essential tool in attracting private capital.\" n98</p><p>As small American inventors still attempt to commercialize their inventions without much needed funded, big tech multinational corporations simply steal the tech, embed it into their systems and using their monopolistic user base and deep pockets, saturate the market with infringing product thereby denying the market to the small American inventor and the sending the startup into the dustbin of history.</p><p>As a result of big tech hijacking the patent system, we now face a rapidly developing national security disaster as early stage funding in technologies critical to our national security flees to China because patent rights can be defended there. In China, a patent dispute will be completed in less than 18 months. 84% of the suits are won by patent holders. Of those requesting injunctive relief, 86% got it. Of foreign entities requesting injunctive relief, nearly 100% got it - the Chinese are marketing to attract foreign investment. And it works. In 2017, 48% of early stage funding of artificial intelligence startup went to Chinese firms. Only 36% went to US firms. n99</p><p>As China attracts startup funding for artificial intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, machine learning, IoT, 5G, and other technologies critical to national security and economic growth, it is developing geographic concentrations knowhow in particular technologies and money to invest in startups developing the next phase of that technology. This is exactly how the Silicon Valley became the tech center of the world. But we now risk losing these technologies to China and it will take generations to retake if once these tech areas are fully established. n100</p><p>The answer to the question of how to reform Section 101 is not inconsequential. It will decide who we are as Americans. Will we will remain the world leader in new technologies? Or will we destroy our economic growth and job creation engines, while we sacrifice our national security?</p><p>Congress will pick the winners by this legislation like they have in the past. n101 If Congress writes 101 to perpetuate big tech monopolies, American innovation will slow and will be overtaken by China.</p><p>Big tech monopolies like all other monopolies do not innovate. Instead they milk their business models. For example, Bell Telephone, which became ATT, was a protected monopoly from 1877 to 1984. n102 Very little changed in phone systems during that time except things that reduced labor. But immediately after the government broke them up, we got electronic answering machines, digital lines, cell phones and then smart phones, Wi-Fi, the internet and much more, all of which sprang from innovative startups enabled by the patent system. Even today, Apple has been lulled to sleep allowing Huawei phones to surpass iPhones in technology and market share. n103</p><p>Patents are often referred to as monopolies. n104 But that is a fundamental misunderstanding of how patents work to enhance competition. The truth is that a patent is a natural anti-monopoly. Most inventors do not have the millions of dollars it takes to commercialize a tech invention and bring it to market. That means inventors need money. But investors need collateral. If a patent cannot be defended because it will be invalidated or it costs too much to defend, the patent cannot be used as collateral. Without investment, a tech startup cannot bring their wares to market and therefore cannot challenge big tech.</p><p>This hearing is about judicially created exceptions under Section 101. The most damaging of these exceptions is known as the abstract idea. The Supreme Court created this exception in Alice v CLS bank, but it did not define it then and has refused to define it ever since. The Supreme Court has shown that it is incapable of fixing the mess it created and Congress must act.</p><p>The Supreme Court let free a demon targeted at tech inventions that has rendered complete swaths of technology unpatentable or uninvestible. These fields include the same technologies that China is attempting to capture in their 2025 Initiative: artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, 5G, machine learning and others critical to our national and economic security.</p><p>Tech patents are seldom allowed by the USPTO because of 101 jurisprudence, but if a patent somehow slips through, the courts will kill 64% of those challenged as abstract ideas.</p><p>Today, big tech cannot be challenged with better tech because the only effective tool enabling competition has been destroyed for the very type of tech inventions that big tech has monopolized, business methods and software.</p><p>Big tech defends 101 exceptions because eliminating patents and/or patent protection for business methods perpetuates their monopolies. Big tech can sit back and watch for any company gaining market share or providing products that could potentially disrupt their business models, thus using startups as a cost-free way to test new products in the market.</p><p>Then they swoop in and steal the startup's technology, embed it into their own systems, and using their massive installed base of users and their big tech big bucks massively commercialize it thus taking the market from the startup and killing it.</p><p>A startup with better tech cannot challenge the big tech goliaths unless their patents are strongly presumed valid and wield an exclusive right.</p><p>But why are some venture capitalists and startups arguing that Section 101 exceptions should not be eliminated? Why are some tech startups different than others? For example, Jared Kushner argues that VC's do not want to fix 101. The answer is in the kind of startups. Oscar, Slack, Robinhood, Stripe, Spotify, Twitch and GitHub are all current and past investments by Josh Kushner, Jared's brother. These apps are sold through Apple App Store and GooglePlay.</p><p>Apple App Store is a monopoly controlled by Apple. The only way to sell phone apps that run on iPhones is through the Apple App Store. Apple completely controls the content on this store. Apple even denies access of apps that are too similar to existing apps on their store and any app that competes with apps provided by Apple. n105 Apps can also be arbitrarily removed for any reason. This is monopoly control.</p><p>Those selling apps on an app store do not need patents because the app store effectively is a patent system protecting them from infringers via Apple's monopolistic abuse. Apple picks the winners and the losers, with Apple always winning.</p><p>Non-disclosure agreements forbid app developers from publishing Apple rejection notices or even talking about the reasons for being ejected from the app store. Therefore, Apples abuse is hidden from public scrutiny and Congress. It is not known how many apps have been rejected to thwart competition.</p><p>This creates pressure for app developers to remain on the good side of Apple. If you fall from their graces, your app will be removed, and you will be gagged.</p><p>Google's Play Store is similar.</p><p>Amazon's marketplace works very similar in exercising monopoly control. n106</p><p>Not all software companies are app stores. Many provide cutting edge technologies that could displace big tech monopolies. The effects of Section 101 harms those inventors and startups the most. When they become a threat or an encumbrance, big tech giants stifle that competition by burying competing companies at the bottom of news feeds and search results. n107 n108 n109 n110</p><p>The sad result of destroying the US patent system is that these tech companies could monopolize thus enabling abuse their monopolies to stifle competition and steal patented inventions. If they steal an invention, they can easily invalidate the patent due to the PTAB and the abstract idea. And since eBay v MercExchange, even if they fail to invalidate the patent and they lose an infringement case, the worst that will happen is they will be awarded a compulsory license with damages calculated by a liberal arts major in a robe who has never started up a company or marketed a product, and cannot possibly know what the market value of an invention is.</p><p>If they steal it, they keep it and the cost is lower than licensing it in the free market.</p><p>It is a simple and well-known fact that the patent system has collapsed for independent inventors and startups. While US Inventor member, Josh Malone, succeeded in his infringement case, he still lost due to the infringement by driving down profit, he failed to recover nearly $16 million dollars spent on litigation and he was forced into litigation thus losing opportunities to develop his next big product.</p><p>Bunch O Balloons is the bestselling toy bringing in $100 million dollars in annual revenue. TeleBrands took a calculated risk. It directly copied Bunch O Balloons ignoring patents, and massively commercialized it using their existing marketing, and production and distribution capabilities in an attempt to destroy Josh's company long before it could generate enough revenue to sue them for patent infringement. But Josh's management and steadfast determination drove Bunch O Balloons sales and positioned his company with the resources to fight an expensive multi-million-dollar patent infringement battle.</p><p>Revenue must be high enough to justify fighting a patent infringement battle. Bunch O Balloons was high enough, but most are not. Indeed, TeleBrands has been sued by over 70 time for patent infringement. All of which were forced to settle at a fraction of the value of the infringement.</p><p>Josh's win may appear to be a win for the patent system, but in reality, it should be a wakeup call showing that the patent system is not working.</p><p>The Status Quo Prevents Competition Through Gamesmanship</p><p>Now that they succeeded at virtual total destruction of the patent system, tech companies and their sympathizers are telling this subcommittee that the patent system is working, don't change anything. What they are saying is there is no possible way that a patented invention can threaten their monopoly status and they like it that way. If we prove our technology is valuable they simply take it and there is nothing we can do about it. It is a great system for the tech behmoths - no risk, all reward. The status quo provides endless opportunities to avoid liability for using technology owned by an inventor with finite legal resources. Examples abound:</p><p>The PTAB ignored the [Sec.]315(b) time bar and permitted GoPro to file an IPR 2.5 years after they had filed a declaratory judgment against inventor Michael Kintner's company 360Heros. n111 The once growing business has drastically downsized and Kintner has informed US Inventor that he does not have funds for a legal defense of his patent at the PTAB. Contingency firms rely on damages to recoup their investment, but in the PTAB there is no monetary compensation for the inventor that prevails.</p><p>Apple refused to pay inventor Mark Kilbourne for his remote control deadbolt, so they asked the PTAB to revoke his patent. n112 The panel ruled that it \"would have been obvious\" to combine an old-style deadbolt with a Swiss army knife. This type of reasoning jeopardizes every patent ever issued. Kilbourne runs a small business manufacturing his invention and this unnecessary and duplicative PTAB trial imposes an extreme burden and risk to his business.</p><p>Corephotonics inventors developed a compact telephoto lens for smartphones. The USPTO is yet again assisting Apple by taking back the patent from the inventors. n113 The invention is a tiny optical design with \"total track length\" of only 6.5mm. The PTAB construed \"total track length\" as \"partial track length\" so they could find prior art with a \"partial track length\" of 6.5mm. If inventors cannot rely on the USTPO to stand behind their patents then businesses like Corphotonics cannot afford to invest in RandD and innovation is discouraged.</p><p>PTAB APJs that have zero experience with video compression technology violated several of the new rules and helped Netflix avoid paying the inventors for their asymmetric video compression technology. n114 One APJ has a B.S. in computer science with no professional experience, one a degree in molecular biology, and another in materials science. They do have 30+ years combined experience disparaging patents as litigators and PTAB APJs. They are in way over their heads causing total chaos and destruction to the U.S. innovation economy.</p><p>Rocky Snawerdt invented a secure fiber optic switch, extremely important technology. But he made the mistake of revealing his discovery to the USPTO who decimated his patent to help Alcatel and Nokia. n115 The task achieved by the panel was to find 3 or 4 components of Rocky's invention in the prior art, using his patent as a roadmap. That doesn't mean it was obvious. That's what an invention is - putting things together in a new way no one else thought of. These APJs have no experience in the technology and don't understand the law. What they are doing is analogous to a child assembling a jigsaw puzzle using the picture on the box as a guide. It has nothing to do with the technology, the invention, or the law.</p><p>Steven and Mary Reiber's semicon-ductor wire bonding patent survived a validity challenge in district court, but the PTAB doesn't honor that holding. n116 In addition the PTAB allowed Toshiba to play games with their corporate structure to get around the one year time bar.</p><p>PTAB instituted review of a haptic feedback patent by prolific artificial intelligence and augmented reality inventor Louis Rosenberg. n117 Once again Director Iancu's new rules are tossed aside by the PTAB. Rather than let the real court resolve the dispute at the jury trial, the PTAB insists on inserting themselves into the middle of it. The same prior art considered in examination. Incorrect claim construction by the PTAB. The USPTO is taking the side of the multi-national infringer Samsung. More cost. More delay. Inventors betrayed by the USPTO.</p><p>Patrick Racz is the sort of inventor the patent system is supposed to encourage. He invented valuable digital rights management technology. Apple studied his technology and implemented it without authorization. After extensive litigation and a jury verdict in favor of Racz's assignee Smartflash, Apple was not even close to finished. They persuaded the PTAB to overturn the judge and jury and rule his patents invalid under section 101. n118 This new, useful, non-obvious, and clearly defined technology was misappropriated by Apple due to the chaos in Section 101 jurisprudence and stacking panels at the PTAB and Federal Circuit. The status quo provides endless tools for deep-pocketed incumbents to keep out competition, and they don't want Congress taking away a single one of them.</p><p>Dr. Thomas Sawyer founder of VOIP-Pal has been vocal about the gamesmanship perpetrated by Apple under the status quo. His company developed valuable secure domain registration technology and received several patents. When Apple petitioned their former lawyers now at the PTAB to revoke the VOIP-Pal patents, Dr. Sawyer took the PTAB corruption head on and won a hard fought validation. n119 Apple responded by having the patents thrown out by Northern District of California Judge Lucy Koh as abstract and ineligible under Section 101. n120 Inventors cannot prevail against big tech incumbents in the status quo.</p><p>Moving Forward</p><p>The original \"framework\" established by this Subcommittee proposed to codify current 101 exceptions, and to expand the categories of exceptions. This would have left the patent system is disarray for a generation.</p><p>US Inventor objected and we are appreciative that the Subcommittee took stakeholder feedback seriously in the new proposal eliminating all exceptions. However, the new proposed language does little to improve the crashed patent system. Instead, it passes the confusion created under 101 to 100 and 112 leaving the patent system in disarray.</p><p>Courts define terms in law to bring exact meaning to the terms. Defining the exact meaning of any terms before that legislation is passed is therefore critical to avoiding unintended consequences. Allowing the courts to define the meaning of the terms will bring what it has always brought, confusion and uncertainty.</p><p>Provisions in the new proposed legislation bring confusion and uncertainty as the courts define the terms. In the end, it is likely that we will end in the same place with complete swaths of tech unpatentable with the effect of protecting the monopolies of big tech multinationals. This will not evade the impending damage to our national and economic security, job creation and our global lead in tech.</p><p>The following is the proposed language in bold italics and US Inventor comments below each element:</p><p>Section 100:</p><p>(k) The term \"useful\" means any invention or discovery that provides specific and practical utility in any field of technology through human intervention.</p><p>US Inventor strongly objects to adding Section 100(k) because it subjects all inventions to a \"technology\" test and a \"human intervention\" test.</p><p>But what does \"technology\" mean? It technology anything made by man? If not, there must be somethings that do not qualify as \"technology\". Are drugs \"technology\"? Are biological monitors \"technology\"? Are mechanical devices \"technology\"? Are software inventions \"technology\"? Are business methods \"technology\"?</p><p>Also, what does \"human intervention\" mean? If software is invented to only work with other software without any \"human intervention\", can it be patented?</p><p>The terms \"technology\" and \"human intervention\" will create long term confusion and uncertainty, and will deny patents for artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, quantum computing, 5G and other inventions critical to our national and economic security.</p><p>Section 100(k) defines the term \"useful\" used in Section 101, which means that examination under Section 101 requires that an invention \"provides specific and practical utility\".</p><p>But this analysis is already performed under Section 112. USPTO Director Iancu is on the record multiple times and under oath testifying to Congress that Section 112 is working well:</p><p>In other words, and pursuant to the Patent Act of 1952, we should keep invalidity rejections in their own lanes. If something is not novel or is obvious, we should invalidate it under 102 or 103. If something is indefinite, or too broad to be fully enabled or described, we should invalidate it under 112. We have decades of case law from the courts and decades of experience at the PTO examining millions of patent applications, which guide us in our 102, 103 and 112 analyses. People know these standards and know how to apply these well-defined statutory requirements. n121(emphasis added)</p><p>US Inventor supports changes proposed under Section 101(a) and (b) and the Additional Legislative Provisions eliminating judicially created exceptions.</p><p>We recommend that useful be removed for Section 101(a). Whether an invention is useful can only be determined when people use it. Not even the inventor can know if people will use it at the time of the invention. Often inventors file new patent applications or continuations in part to cover advancements to the original invention that make it useful after the inventor tests the market. These improvements may or may not already be covered in the specification.</p><p>In addition, no court can ever be tasked with determining whether an invention is useful. If it is not useful, it will not be infringed and therefore it not be litigated. A patent that is not useful will never make it to court.</p><p>No patent examiner can know if any given invention is useful because no patent examiner has the knowledge of the experience and needs of every human on the planet. One man's garbage is another man's treasure. An examiner can only guess what is useful and guessing brings flawed results that will undoubtedly eliminate patent protection for meritorious inventions.</p><p>The proposed Section 112(f) language is a Trojan Horse squarely favoring big tech monopolies.</p><p>Inventors describe our inventions in the specification of the patent using drawings, examples (or embodiments), details, and principles. The objective it to communicate, not to lawyers, but to other experts in the field - referred to as persons of ordinary skill. These drawings, examples, details, and principles elucidate the essence of the invention - a general description of the invention.</p><p>The claims are a separate part of the patent. They define the boundary line around what the inventor owns. This requirement was added in the Patent Act of 1836 to provide clarity and precision as to what subject matter is owned by the inventor.</p><p>We use a robust full-featured language relevant to the field of the invention in order to precisely define this boundary of our invention. It is often proper and indeed necessary for a precise boundary to use functional language. Terms like fastener, rotational, amplifier, filter, and volatile memory.</p><p>The proposed revisions to Section 112 would prohibit using functional language such as this, demanding that inventors describe each and every structure. For instance instead of fastener, we would have to claim a bolt, screw, rivet, cotter pin, zip tie, epoxy, and so on. This will require an exhaustive and costly effort to catalog each and every structure that can achieve every function employed in the invention. More importantly, leaving out one single option will render the patent useless by permitting a competitor to use the teachings of the inventor by merely substituting an unclaimed element into a copycat product.</p><p>An inventor must describe every possible way of performing the same function in a highly detailed manner in the specification, and for each possible way, a new set of claims must be written. There is very high risk that courts will not accept equivalents or will restrict equivalents significantly.</p><p>Nearly every claim in every issued patent would become significantly narrowed in scope on the day of enactment to require narrowing concepts named in the specification but deliberately omitted from the claim by the responsible claim drafter.</p><p>The proposed Section 112(f) language further exacerbates the first to file provisions in the America Invents Act. Under first to file, inventors file for patent protection before they test the invention in the market, develop a prototype or design for manufacture. As these tasks are competed, inventors often to file a continuation in part or a new application to incorporate what they learned. The first application may not have things detailed in the specification well enough until the later applications are filed, thus losing the earlier filing date. An inventor is forced to conceive of every possible way of doing the same thing on the day of invention, which is a severe disadvantage for the inventor.</p><p>Proposed changes to Section 112(f) will prove disastrous to tech patents. There are 571 coding languages each with multiple ways of doing the same thing. An inventor must list every imaginable way to avoid legal gamesmanship. This is an impossible task that will make most tech patents undefendable. The proposed Section 112(f) language will force the drafter to detail every function, well-known or new, in the claims and in the specification. Given the new requirements for detail, the inventor will have to claim the invention at a code level in as many coding languages as could be used to implement the invention.</p><p>To cover all possible way of implementing an invention in software code, the specification may need to be hundreds of pages long. Depending on the complexity of the invention, some specification may require thousands of pages to cover all the possible coding languages.</p><p>This is an impossible task. All patents, especially software inventions, will be rendered valueless for investment because nobody can figure out all of the possible ways to write code for every possibility coding language in a specification, each with multiple ways of coding to same thing.</p><p>Investors are smart enough to know that that if one coding method or language is missing from the specification, the patent may be worked around and not defendable. This means that when investors perform due diligence on the investment, they will undoubtedly require that all possible coding methods for the invention are covered in the specification.</p><p>Just the burden of hiring multiple coding experts to ensure that the patent covers each possible coding method and type of code will turn away most investors. Undoubtedly, it will turn away early stage investors who do not have the resources to hire the engineers to evaluate all possibilities. These are the most important investors because without the first investment, the startup does not start.</p><p>This is a foolish clause, which will benefit no one except big tech.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Don't get fooled again. We need to come together to examine the unintended consequences of the AIA, eBay, KSR, and other Supreme Court legislation, and really do the due diligence on what is being proposed by this 100 and 112(f) legislation and any other patent reforms.</p><p>First, please do no more harm.</p><p>Second, learn from our mistakes. Senator Crapo you were not on this committee during the AIA but Idaho's constituent Micron was. They co-founded the infringer lobby in 2006 - the Coalition for Patent Fairness. And their CEO even came to testify - the rare CEO witness. While under oath he told this committee how bad the patent troll problem was, yet his company was selling 5,000 patents to a patent monetization entity - exactly what the infringer lobby would call a troll. Was this CEO talking out of both sides of his mouth or lying to this committee? He is dead now but the facts speak loudly.</p><p>Lesson here is to ask each witness at these hearings where they get their money from and who their words stand to benefit. Let's have a real party in interest test for each and every witness.</p><p>In the Innovation Act, Congress asked patent owners to identify their real parties in interest for the sake of determining fees to shift. And the USPTO and the courts are being asked whether a party bringing an IPR or an appeal to an IPR decision by the PTAB needs to be a real party in interest.</p><p>Even the US Postal Service is being represented by the US DOJ at the US Supreme Court to argue that the US Postal Service should be construed as a human person in order to qualify to file an IPR to kill a patent created by a startup in Alabama that the US Postal Service asked the startup to provide but then decided it was cheaper to steal it and to lawyer up and fight off any infringement claims. Why are tax dollars being used to fund lawyers at DOJ to kill off a patent created by a startup? This case was argued at the US Supreme Court in February. n122 It was the first day back for a live hearing by Justice Ginsburg and she was on fire as were all the Justices talking at each other about how ridiculous it was for the government to put the thumb on the scales and have superior rights to due process and to the startup inventor.</p><p>What an embarrassment. China is laughing.</p><p>n1 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/07/23/call-enacting-urgent-patent-reform-new-patent-system-securing-u-s-technological-leadership/id=85906/\">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/07/23/call-enacting-urgent-patent-reform-new-patent-system-securing-u-s-technological-leadership/id=85906/</url></p><p>n2 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2016/06/06/supreme-court-legislated-patent-reform/id=69646/\">https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2016/06/06/supreme-court-legislated-patent-reform/id=69646/</url></p><p>n3 <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/state-of-seed-investing-in-2018-25eb28ac0e93\">https://medium.com/the-mission/state-of-seed-investing-in-2018-25eb28ac0e93</url></p><p>n4 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-state-of-competition-and-dynamism-facts-about-concentration-start-ups-and-related-policies/\">https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-state-of-competition-and-dynamism-facts-about-concentration-start-ups-and-related-policies/</url></p><p>n5 <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/06.13.17-Mossoff-Testimony.pdf\">https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/06.13.17-Mossoff-Testimony.pdf</url></p><p>n6 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/03/29/bad-patents-are-just-another-big-tech-false-narrative/id=107819/\">https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/03/29/bad-patents-are-just-another-big-tech-false-narrative/id=107819/</url></p><p>n7 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/paying-professors-inside-googles-academic-influence-campaign-1499785286\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/paying-professors-inside-googles-academic-influence-campaign-1499785286</url></p><p>n8 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/effector/32/3\">https://www.eff.org/effector/32/3</url></p><p>n9 See <url normalizedValue=\"http://english.sipo.gov.cn/news/official/201402/t20140226_907949.html\">http://english.sipo.gov.cn/news/official/201402/t20140226_907949.html</url>) TRENDS IN PATENTING AND THE GLOBALIZATION OF CHINESE INNOVATION, REUTERS September 2014</p><p>n10 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/business/02unboxed.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/business/02unboxed.html</url></p><p>n11 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2016/article_0017.html\">http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2016/article_0017.html</url></p><p>n12 <url normalizedValue=\"http://watchdog.org/283886/venture-capital-chases-patents-friendlier-climes/\">http://watchdog.org/283886/venture-capital-chases-patents-friendlier-climes/</url></p><p>n13 Handbook for Finnish Startups Entering the Chinese Market, ISSN 1797-7339, ISBN 978-952-457-630-7 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=tandrct=jandq=andesrc=sandsource=webandcd=2andved=0ahUKEwimwsnIspvVAhXFQiYKHRk3DFcQ\">https://www.google.com/url?sa=tandrct=jandq=andesrc=sandsource=webandcd=2andved=0ahUKEwimwsnIspvVAhXFQiYKHRk3DFcQ</url></p><p>n14 <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/08/news/economy/us-startups-near-40-year-low/index.html\">http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/08/news/economy/us-startups-near-40-year-low/index.html</url></p><p>n15 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/2017/04/04/silicon-valley-investing-slump-continues-fewer-startups-get-funded/\">http://www.siliconvalley.com/2017/04/04/silicon-valley-investing-slump-continues-fewer-startups-get-funded/</url></p><p>n16 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/07/23/chinese-president-xi-jinping-says-infringers-punished-pay-heavy-price/id=85953/#comment-2743864\">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/07/23/chinese-president-xi-jinping-says-infringers-punished-pay-heavy-price/id=85953/#comment-2743864</url></p><p>n17 <url normalizedValue=\"https://chinaipr.com/category/spc/\">https://chinaipr.com/category/spc/</url></p><p>n18 Statement of JUDGE PAUL R.

I love America and democracy, and I am also not a conservative. I have been center/center-left my whole adult life. You'll see in moment why this fact is relevant to my testimony.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am here today for three reasons: to explain why Google presents a serious threat to democracy and human autonomy, to explain how passive monitoring systems can protect us both now and in the future from companies like Google, and to tell you how Congress can immediately end Google's worldwide monopoly on search. My plan for ending that monopoly was published just yesterday (Monday, July 15, 2019) by Bloomberg Businessweek (Epstein, 2019d). I am attaching a copy of my article to my testimony and respectfully request that it be entered into the Congressional Record.</p><p>I have been a research psychologist for nearly 40 years and have also served in various editorial positions at Psychology Today magazine and Scientific American MIND. I received my Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1981 and have since published 15 books and more than 300 scientific and mainstream articles on artificial intelligence and other topics. Since 2012, some of my research and writings have focused on Google LLC, specifically on the company's power to suppress content - the censorship problem, if you will - as well as on the massive surveillance the company conducts, and also on the company's unprecedented ability to manipulate the thoughts and behavior of more than 2.5 billion people worldwide.</p><p>Data I've collected since 2016 show that Google displays content to the American public that is biased in favor on one political party (Epstein and Williams, 2019) - a party I happen to like, but that's irrelevant. No private company should have either the right or the power to manipulate large populations without their knowledge.</p><p>I've published articles about my research on Google in both scientific publications and a wide array of mainstream news sources: in TIME magazine, U.S. News and World Report, USA Today, Dissent, The Hill, and Huffington Post, for example, but also in The Daily Caller and even in Russia's Sputnik News.</p><p>I reach out to diverse different audiences because the threats posed by Google, and, to a lesser extent, Facebook, are so serious that I think everyone in the world needs to know about them. I put my own political leanings aside when I report my data and concerns because the problems these companies present eclipse personal politics. To put this another way, I love humanity, my country, and democracy more than I love any particular party or candidate. And democracy as originally conceived cannot survive Big Tech as currently empowered.</p><p>If you were to examine the data I have been collecting over the past 6-and-a-half years, every one of you would put partisanship aside and collaborate to reign in the extraordinary power that Google and Facebook now wield with unabashed arrogance.</p><p>Here are five disturbing findings from my research, which adheres, I believe, to the highest possible scientific standards in all respects:</p><p>1. In 2016, biased search results generated by Google's search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that gave at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton (whom I supported). I know this because I preserved more than 13,000 election-related searches conducted by a diverse group of Americans on Google, Bing, and Yahoo in the weeks leading up to the election, and Google search results - which dominate search in the U.S. and worldwide - were significantly biased in favor of Secretary Clinton in all 10 positions on the first page of search results in both blue states and red states.</p><p>I know the number of votes that shifted because I have conducted dozens of controlled experiments in the U.S. and other countries that measure precisely how opinions and votes shift when search results favor one candidate, cause, or company. I call this shift \"SEME\" - the Search Engine Manipulation Effect. My first scientific paper on SEME was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in 2015 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://is.gd/p0li8V\">https://is.gd/p0li8V</url>) (Epstein and Robertson, 2015a) and has since been accessed or downloaded from PNAS's website more than 200,000 times. SEME has also been replicated by a research team at one of the Max Planck Institutes in Germany.</p><p>SEME is one of the most powerful forms of influence ever discovered in the behavioral sciences, and it is especially dangerous because it is invisible to people - \"subliminal,\" in effect. It leaves people thinking they have made up their own minds, which is very much an illusion. It also leaves no paper trail for authorities to trace. Worse still, the very few people who can detect bias in search results shift even farther in the direction of the bias, so merely being able to see the bias doesn't protect you from it. Bottom line: biased search results can easily produce shifts in the opinions and voting preference of undecided voters by 20 percent or more - up to 80 percent in some demographic groups.</p><p>Bear in mind here that all Google search results are, in a sense, biased. There are no equal-time rules built into Google algorithm. It always puts one widget ahead of another - and one candidate ahead of another.</p><p>SEME is an example of an \"ephemeral experience,\" and that's a phrase you'll find in internal emails that have leaked from Google recently. A growing body of evidence suggests that Google employees deliberately engineer ephemeral experiences to change people's thinking. (For details about the methodology used in SEME experiments, please see the Appendix at the end of this testimony.)</p><p>Since 2013, I have discovered about a dozen subliminal effects like SEME, and I am currently studying and quantifying seven of them (<url normalizedValue=\"https://is.gd/DbIhZw\">https://is.gd/DbIhZw</url>) (Epstein, 2018i).</p><p>2. On Election Day in 2018, the \"Go Vote\" reminder Google displayed on its home page gave one political party between 800,000 and 4.6 million more votes than it gave the other party. Those numbers might seem impossible, but I published my analysis in January 2019 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://is.gd/WCdslm\">https://is.gd/WCdslm</url>) (Epstein, 2019a), and it is quite conservative. Google's data analysts presumably performed the same calculations I did before the company decided to post its prompt. In other words, Google's \"Go Vote\" prompt was not a public service; it was a vote manipulation.</p><p>3. In the weeks leading up to the 2018 election, bias in Google's search results may have shifted upwards of 78.2 million votes to the candidates of one political party (spread across hundreds of local and regional races). This number is based on data captured by my 2018 monitoring system, which preserved more than 47,000 election-related searches on Google, Bing, and Yahoo, along with the nearly 400,000 web pages to which the search results linked. Strong political bias toward one party was evident, once again, in Google searches (Epstein and Williams, 2019).</p><p>4. My recent research demonstrates that Google's \"autocomplete\" search suggestions can turn a 50/50 split among undecided voters into a 90/10 split without people's awareness (<url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/2EcYnYI\">http://bit.ly/2EcYnYI</url>) (Epstein, Mohr, and Martinez, 2018). A growing body of evidence suggests that Google is manipulating people's thinking and behavior from the very first character people type into the search box.</p><p>5. Google has likely been determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide since at least 2015. This is because many races are very close and because Google's persuasive technologies are very powerful (Epstein and Robertson, 2015a).</p><p>These effects are nothing like Russian-placed ads or fake news stories. Russian interference, although troubling and unacceptable, does not, in my opinion, shift many votes (Epstein, 2017d, 2018a). Ads and news stories are competitive and visible, like billboards. The kinds of ephemeral effects I am studying, however, are invisible and non-competitive. They are controlled entirely by Big Tech companies, and there is no way to counteract them.</p><p>I have also studied and written about Google's massive surveillance operations - most of which people are completely unaware of - and Google's pervasive and unpredictable pattern of censorship, but time does not not permit me to discuss my work in these areas today. On the issue of censorship, I refer the Committee Members to a 2016 report I published in U.S. News and World Report called \"The New Censorship\" (<url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/28PgBmW\">http://bit.ly/28PgBmW</url>) (Epstein, 2016d), which described nine different blacklists Google maintains to suppress information worldwide. We are all aware that Google deletes or blocks access to videos on YouTube, which it owns, but few people are aware that Google blocks access to millions of websites. On January 31, 2009, Google blocked access to virtually the entire internet for 40 minutes.</p><p>By the way, it is not just conservative content that gets censored (Epstein, 2018h). At times, Google also censors progressive and socialist content. The problem with Google is not that it censors conservatives; the problem is that it has the power to determine what content billions of people worldwide will or not see. No single entity - especially a private company that is not accountable to the public - should have such power (Epstein, 2016d).</p><p>I know how to stop Big Tech companies dead in their tracks, and that brings me, finally, to monitoring systems and the proposal I published yesterday.</p><p>Back in 2015, a telephone call from Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, prompted me to start a years-long project in which I learned to monitor what Big Tech companies are showing real users. In early 2016, I launched my first large-scale, Neilsen-type monitoring system that allowed my team to look over people's shoulders and, with user permission, to capture the search results they were seeing on their computer screens before those results disappeared (Epstein, 2018d). I successfully deployed such systems in 2016 and 2018, and I'm raising funds now to build a much larger and more comprehensive system in early 2020 - one that will allow us to catch Big Tech companies in the act - to instantly spot when Google is showing people politically biased search results; when Twitter is suppressing tweets sent by the President, Ann Coulter, or Elizabeth Warren; when Facebook is sending out \"Register to Vote\" reminders only to members of one party.</p><p>This system must be built to keep an eye on Big Tech in 2020 because if these companies all support the same candidate - and that's likely, needless to say - they will be able to shift upwards of 15 million votes to that candidate with no one knowing and without leaving a paper trail.</p><p>To let Big Tech companies get away with invisible manipulation on this scale would be to abandon the free-and-fair election, a cornerstone of democracy. It would make democracy meaningless, even if your chosen candidate prevailed.</p><p>A worldwide network of passive monitoring systems must be built to protect humanity and democracy from manipulations by today's Google and the Googles of tomorrow. Only tech can fight tech; laws and regulations will never keep up (Epstein, 2018d).</p><p>Finally, yesterday I published an article explaining how Congress can quickly end Google's worldwide monopoly on search (Epstein, 2019d). The solution to The Google Problem is to declare Google's massive search index - the database the company uses to generate search results - to be a public commons, accessible by all, just as a 1956 consent decree forced ATandT to share all its patents. There is precedent in both law and in Google's own business practices to justify taking this step.</p><p>Declaring Google's index a commons will quickly give rise to thousands of search platforms like Google.com, each competing with Google, each providing excellent search results, each serving niche audiences, large and small, exactly like newspapers and television networks and websites do now. Search will become competitive, as it was during its early years, and democracy will be protected from Google's secretive machinations.</p><p>In his famous departing speech in January, 1961, President Eisenhower warned about the possible rise of a \"technological elite\" that could control public policy without people's awareness (Epstein, 2016a, 2018c). That elite now exists, and they have more power than you think. It's up to Congress to determine where we go from here.</p><p>Chairman Cruz, Ranking Member Hirono, other Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to your questions.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/epstein-testimonyanddownload=1\">https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/epstein-testimonyanddownload=1</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSC716923057179971799</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKG-35N1-JCCP-02FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2134\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0004P2N</classCode><className>U S NEWS &amp;

Good afternoon. Let me say to folks who are attending, I apologize the hearing was delayed in our start time. We had a series of votes on the Senate floor that just concluded.  </p><p>And so, welcome. Welcome to our witnesses. This past April, this Subcommittee held a hearing on social media bias with witnesses from Facebook and Twitter. As I noted then, any inquiry into Big Text censorship practices must take an especially hard look at Google. That's what we're doing here today.  </p><p>Google's control over what people here, watch, read and say is unprecedented. Almost 90 percent of internet searches in the United States use Google. Google's domination of the search engine market is so complete that to \"Google\" is now a commonplace verb. With that market power, Google can and often does control our discourse. And sometimes tech companies talk about their products and the effects of those products as though they're forces outside of Big Text control.  </p><p>As we've heard time and time again, Big Text favorite defense is, \"It wasn't me. The algorithm did it.\" But Google Search engine isn't some supernatural force. It's a computer program written and maintained by people.  </p><p>So, every time we search on Google, we see only the webpages that Google decides we should see in the order that Google decides we should see them. Type a few letters into the search bar and Google will tell you what you should be looking for.  </p><p>The same is true of Google's subsidiary, YouTube--the second most visited webpage in existence. When you search on YouTube, programs written by people at YouTube provide you with the results. </p><p>When you watch a video, a program written by the people at YouTube suggests what you should watch next.  </p><p>And when you submit a video, people at YouTube determine whether you've engaged in so-called \"hate speech\"--an ever-changing and vague standard meant to give censorship an air of legitimacy. This is a staggering amount of power to ban speech, to manipulate search results, to destroy rivals and to shape culture. More and more, Americans are demanding accountability from Big Tech for that massive power. </p><p>One thing is certain, Congress never intended to empower large technology companies to control our speech when it passed Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That provision--Section 230--gave tech companies special privileges that nobody else gets. If the New York Times or the Wall Street Journey were to publish an Op Ed that libeled a private citizen, they can be held responsible. This is the case even when those organizations don't write the content that breaks the law. They can be held responsible merely for publishing it.  </p><p>Not so for companies like Google and YouTube. If someone uses one of those services to commit slander, or to transmit classified material, or to traffic guns, or drugs, far too often Google is off the hook. Section 230 makes it immune. </p><p>Big Tech gets a perk--a subsidy--that no one else does--Fox News, MSNBC, or anybody else. This immunity, however, was part of a deal. It was a trade. Section 230--the text of it--refers to the internet as \"a forum for a true diversity of political discourse\". That was the trade at the heart of Section 230. This is because we expected tech companies in the business of carrying other's speech wouldn't favor any side when they did so. </p><p>There wouldn't be a conservative internet and a liberal internet. There'd just be the internet. That bargain today is falling apart. Big Tech continues to reap the benefits of a Section 230 subsidy, but the American people do not. </p><p>The American people are instead subject to both overt censorship and covert manipulation. I believe it's time to rethink that deal. If Big Tech cannot provide with evidence--clear, compelling data evidence--that it's not playing Big Brother with its vast, immense powers, there's no reason on earth why Congress should give them a special subsidy through Section 230. </p><p>And that takes us to the heart of the problem. Big Tech is anything, but transparent. Google is happy to collect data on everyone, everywhere constantly--on you, on me, on all of us. They make sure they know what you search, what you shop for online, what you like. They track your location within a matter of feet, so that they know when you visit a physical store. </p><p>But the information sharing is a one-way street. This must change. Google cannot simply hide behind its algorithms. Big Tech's algorithms and search engines only do what humans at companies like Google tell them to do. Just as Big Tech needs and wants data on all of us, the American people need and want data on Big Tech. </p><p>They need it to profit. We need it to protect free speech. And I hope that today, Google will start to answer some of our questions fully and candidly, so that we can assess how we can work together to protect the robust marketplace of ideas that American political discourse has been built upon. Senator Hirono. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The calendar says it's July 16th, but it feels like Groundhog Day in the United States Senate. A little more than three months ago, this Subcommittee held a hearing to explore allegations of anti-conservative bias in the tech industry. My friends on the other side were critical of witnesses from Facebook and Twitter. They claimed a vast conspiracy to silence conservative voices. </p><p>After listening to some of the comments from that hearing, you might think that someone that's a real mastermind sets up the controls of those platforms looking at 510,000 Facebook posts and 350,000 Tweets posted every minute and removes anything that might other--align with the Republican Party platform. </p><p>I repeat now what I said then. Claims of anti-conservative bias in the tech industry are baseless. Study after study has debunked suggestions of political bias on the part of Facebook, Google and Twitter.  </p><p>In June of this year, the economists released the findings of a year-long analysis that ran on search results on Google's news tab. It found no evidence that Google biased its results against conservatives.  </p><p>In April, Media Matters completed a 37-week study into alleged conservative censorship on Facebook. It found that right-leaning pages actually outperformed--outperformed left-leaning pages in terms of overall interactions with users. </p><p>Earlier this year, Twitter performed a five-week analysis of tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate. It found no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democratic member is viewed as compared to a tweet by a Republican member.  </p><p>One of our witnesses, Professor Francesca Tripodi has done her own research in this area and she found no evidence that Google censors conservative content either in its main search product or on YouTube. </p><p>In fact, she's found that conservative commentators like Mr. Prager--another of the witnesses today--are extremely adept at optimizing their content for Google Search engine allowing them to capture massive audiences.  </p><p>Undeterred by this evidence, here we are again. Three months after that initial hearing with Facebook and Twitter, it is now Google's turn to be raked over the coals. Google will be accused of political motives for some common-sense actions that are entirely within their rights. </p><p>Just like we saw at the president's so-called \"Social--Social Media Summit\" last week, President Trump invited a rogue's gallery of social media's leading racist (PH) and conspiracy theorists to hear about supposed censorship by tech companies. But none of these people had actually been banned from any platform. Each remains free to use the megaphone social media provides to spread their messages of conspiracy and hate. </p><p>This toting at windmills comes at a cost. After years of being tarred as biased have made tech companies hesitant to deal with the real problems of racist and harassing content on their platforms.  </p><p>According to a report by Vice, Twitter is afraid to use a proactive algorithmic approach it uses to remove ISIS-related content, to rid the platform of white supremacist content. The reason? </p><p>Twitter is afraid it might also catch content posted by Republican politicians.  </p><p>YouTube dragged its feet before taking any action against conservative commentator, Steven Crowder despite being informed of Crowder's two-year homophobic harassment campaign against journalist Carla Masa (PH). When YouTube did finally take action, it took the half measure of removing advertisements from Crowder's videos rather than removing him from the platform entirely.  </p><p>Browbeating the tech industry for a problem that does not exist also draws attention away from the real problems with Google and other tech companies. Last month, a New York Times investigation found that YouTube's recommendation engine served as a roadmap for pedophiles to find videos of younger and younger girls sometimes as young as five or six years old. </p><p>That followed a wired report on the way that pedophiles use the comments section of YouTube videos to identify and share videos of children.  </p><p>A recent Wall Street Journal investigation found that YouTube is overrun by videos pushing fake claims for account secures. This is after YouTube stoked the flames of the antivax movement to the point that measles has returned to this country. </p><p>Another New York Times feature documented the radicalization of a young man who followed YouTube's recommended videos down an outright rabbit hole. </p><p>Google is a big, successful company. It employs some of the smartest people in the country. There is no question in my mind that it can solve these problems--real problems. Unfortunately, as long as we're make--busy making Google defend itself from clear and--with clear and convincing evidence no less, from bogus claims of anti-conservative bias it has no incentive to address these real issues. </p><p>I'm hoping another of our witnesses can shine some light in this area. Andy Parker is the father of journalist Allison Parker. Allison worked for CBS affiliate WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia. On August 26th, 2015 she and her colleague, Adam Ward were conducting a live interview when they were attacked by a gunman. Allison and Adam died at the scene. </p><p>Video of the shooting quickly spread on social media including Google's YouTube. For the past four years, Andy has sent letters to Google. He has met with Google. He has flagged videos on YouTube. He has begged and pleaded that these videos come down. </p><p>Despite Andy's efforts, you can still find video of the tragedy on YouTube to this day and I want Google to tell us why that is. I look forward to hearing from Andy. His work to shine a light on Google's failures honors Allison's memory. </p><p>It also provides a great public service as I hope this Subcommittee, the full Judiciary Committee, and the Senate at large start to focus on the real problems presented by the tech industry and demand action.  </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Now I'm happy to introduce our first witness, Mr. Karan Bhatia from Google. Karan Bhatia currently heads Google's Global Public Policy &amp; Public Relations department. </p><p>Before joining Google, he served as Deputy Undersecretary of Commerce for Industry and Security from 2001-2003, as Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Aviation and International Affairs from 2003-2005, as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative from 2005-2007 and as Head of General Electric's Government Affairs division from 2008-2018.  </p><p>He's--he is a graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School.  </p><p>Thank you for joining us, Mr. Bhatia. And would you please stand and be sworn in? </p><p>Raise your right hand. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give before this Committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? </p><p>BHATIA: (OFF MIC) </p><p>CRUZ: Mr. Bhatia, you may make your opening statement.  </p><p>BHATIA: Thank you, Senators. My name is Karan Bhatia. I lead the Government Affairs &amp; Public Policy function at Google. Previously as mentioned, I served in the George W. Bush Administration and earlier in my career, I spent time at the Heritage Foundation and the Clairmont Institute. And in college, I was Editor of our conservative publication The Princeton Tory. </p><p>I am a first-generation American. My parents imparted to me an abiding passion for the principles of free speech, Democracy and free markets. And this same passion makes me enormously gratified to work at Google--a company that embodies these values every day around the world. </p><p>Google is a proudly American company growing across the U.S. We're investing more than $13 buck--billion to expand our presence in 14 states this year creating thousands of American jobs.  </p><p>We are also a global company and a big American exporter competing vigorously with competitors from around the world. Through our Grow with Google program, we are proud to work with thousands of small American businesses enabling them to tap into the commercial opportunity of the internet. </p><p>We are a company focused on the future as well investing billions of dollars annually in R &amp; D and innovating new products to help people live better lives. For example, by applying artificial intelligence to enable earlier detection of cancer or predict natural disaster. </p><p>But above all, we are a company of more than 100,000 people with a wide range of views, nationalities, and backgrounds dedicated to the company's mission of organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful. </p><p>We live in an amazing time for the free flow of ideas. Never before in the history of mankind has it been possible for so many people to share so many ideas with so many others at so low a cost and through so many different avenues. Internet platforms have been transformative and powerful tools for the marketplace of ideas. </p><p>Among the many beneficiaries of the internet have been political groups. From the Tea Party movement in the United States to the Arab spring, the internet has enabled people to spread political messages and build political communities.  </p><p>Providing a platform for sharing a broad range of information is core to our mission. It is also core to our business model. Google needs to be useful for everyone regardless of race, nationality, or political leanings. We have a strong business incentive to prevent anyone from interfering with the integrity of our products or the results we provide to our users. </p><p>So, let me be clear. Google is not politically biased. Indeed, we go to extraordinary lengths to build our products and enforce our policies in an analytically objective apolitical way. Our platforms reflect the online world that exists. Our job--which we take very seriously--is to deliver to users the most relevant and authoritative information out there. </p><p>And studies have shown that we do just that. Objective third-party studies including most recently a comprehensive year-long assessment by The Economist of Google's results have found no evidence of bias in either direction. </p><p>Additionally, in May of this year, our data scientists analyze daily clickthrough rates on search results to the official websites of members of Congress. The data showed no difference in these metrics whether the member was a Republican or a Democrat. </p><p>We also analyzed official YouTube channels for all senators who had them and we consistently found a balance between Republicans and Democrats. </p><p>Our platform such as Google Search or YouTube deal with massive amounts of information and to manage these volumes, we rely on algorithms, and implement testing, and evaluation by third-party raters. </p><p>None of our systems are designed to filter out individuals or groups based on political viewpoints. Operating at the scale we do, we're bound to get criticism from both sides and we do.  </p><p>From time-to-time for example, political ads may violate our advertising guidelines. And we've disallowed ads from both Democrats and Republicans.  </p><p>From time-to-time our knowledge panels which help you find quick facts when you search for information about topics like Hillary Clinton or the California Republican Party may reflect erroneous information from the web and will need to be corrected.  </p><p>We work hard to learn from our mistakes and improve our products. But these mistakes have effected both parties and are not the product of bias. </p><p>As technology continues to play an increasingly essential role in the lives of Americans, we know that users expect the highest degree of integrity from our products and that we must meet that expectation every day. If we don't, our users will go elsewhere. And that is why we invest so heavily in these systems and tools that help us service the content that is most relevant to our users in an analytically objective a political way. </p><p>Thank you for this opportunity. I look forward to answering your questions. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Bhatia. My first question will not surprise you and it's a simple question. Does Google consider itself a neutral public forum? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, we operate a number of platforms. And they are constructed and operated to be politically neutral or--or apolitical. </p><p>CRUZ: So--so, let me--does Google--the Google Search page--let's just focus on that for a moment.  </p><p>BHATIA: Uh-huh. </p><p>CRUZ: Does Google consider the Google Search page to be a neutral public forum? </p><p>BHATIA: It--we--we construct it. We build it and we operate it to be politically neutral. </p><p>CRUZ: Does Google consider YouTube to be a neutral public forum? </p><p>BHATIA: Similarly, Senator we build and construct it, maintain it with our algorithms to be politically neutral.  </p><p>CRUZ: Mr. Bhatia, I'm going to ask my staff to--to give you a hard copy of a document that was released recently that--that we also sent to you ahead of time. So, this should not be a surprise. It is a document that at least purports to be authored by Google.  </p><p>The title of the document is \"The Good Censor: How Can Google Reassure the World That it Protects Users From Harmful Comment--Content While Still Supporting Free Speech?\" And it's dated March of 2018. Is this document in fact, a document that was--that was prepared within Google? </p><p>BHATIA: I--I--I've seen the document before, Senator. I've seen references to it. I understand that it was, yeah. </p><p>CRUZ: Okay. So, I want to refer you--and the copy you have, the only alteration to it is we've written page numbers on it just for ease of reference. So, those are handwritten. Other than that, this is identical from what we printed from online. And with no objection, I'm going to enter a copy of this in the record with a notation that we did write page numbers on it. </p><p>I want to refer you initially to page 14 wherein page 14 this Google document says, \"An important U.S. federal statute from 1996 supports this position of neutrality\" and it describes how section--under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act tech firms have legal immunity from the majority of the content posted on their platforms. This protection has empowered YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit to create spaces for free speech without fear of legal action. So, Google itself understood on the face of this document that Section 230--that immunity is predicated upon--as the title of this page says--neutrality. </p><p>I'd now like to refer you to page 65 of the document. Put this chart up as well. So, in page 65 of the document, this Google document says, \"Tech forms--tech firms are performing a balancing act between two incompatible positions. On the one side, they create an unmediated marketplace of ideas, 100 percent commit to the American tradition that prioritizes free speech for Democracy, not civility creating spaces where all values including civility norms are always open for debate.\" That's on the one side in Google's own assessment. </p><p>On the other side is \"create well-ordered spaces for safety and civility, 100 percent commit to the European tradition that favors dignity over liberty and civility over freedom by censoring--\" and I will note this is Google's word \"--censoring racial and religious patriot even when there's no provocation to violence.\" </p><p>Now this Google document lays this out as a balancing act between two incompatible positions. But yet, two pages later in the document on page 67, Google concludes \"In the eyes of Big Tech, which side has won out?\" </p><p>And indeed, according to Google's document \"The Good Sensor\" Google says, \"Tech firms have gradually shifted away from unmediated free speech and towards censorship in moderation.\" So, I guess--and my first question, is this accurate? Does Google engage in--using your own words--\"censorship in moderation\"? </p><p>BHATIA: So, Senator, first just to place this document in context, this was--as I understand it--sort of the thought experiment and sort of a discussion was underway among our marketing team. It was a marketing document and it was thinking about sort of this broader tension that exists between on the one hand, being a forum for free speech and on the other hand, seeking to introduce certain rule of the road or--or community guidelines to make sure that the online environment is one that is, you know, one that users will want to participate in. </p><p>And so, it was discussing that tension. It is not reflective necessarily of the views of the company as a whole. It is not-- </p><p>CRUZ: Let me--let me ask my question again, Mr. Bhatia. Is this document prepared within Google--is it accurate? Is Google engaged in--and the terms used are censorship in moderation and the moderation in this context, I understand not to mean being moderate, but rather actively moderating the speech that occurs. Is that in fact what Google is doing which is censoring and moderating speech on its platform? </p><p>BHATIA: So, I would not say that we are censoring the speech on our platform. In fact, there is a direct, you know, the--the--the--as I mentioned in my opening remarks, remarkable opportunities for every part of the political spectrum to be able to participate through online--through the online platforms. </p><p>We do have come--for instance, let's take our YouTube platform. We do have community guidelines that precludes for instance, people from uploading videos that might contain violent extremism, that might contain--and might contain hate speech that would prescribe or encourage/insight violence against protecting--  </p><p>CRUZ: And let's be clear. This is not--given also that you're prepared. You've got the logos if I'm recognizing them correctly for Facebook, for Twitter, for Google and YouTube all on the side towards censorship and moderation. And in fact, the chart goes on to say \"Create well-ordered spaces for safety and civil--civility.\" And then, it gives--has three words--politicized, editor and publisher. Are those accurate descriptions? Is--is Google or YouTube editors and publishers? </p><p>BHATIA: No, sir, Senator. I don't believe we are. And again, I'm not sure the context in which those words were placed up there. But--but no, we--we are not. </p><p>CRUZ: So--so, this Google document, your position is it's just wrong and is that correct? </p><p>BHATIA: My--my position is that this is--there are many documents that get produced where you have teams to go off and think about what's going on in the ecosystem. And I think this document reflects thinking, you know, that's being done by a marketing team. </p><p>CRUZ: And--and in fact, the next page of--of this slide deck--which I don't think I have in larger form, but I'll read it for--for you. It's page 68 in the version in front of you says, \"For a long time we thought of censorship in terms of government and nation states. And I think we're now in an era in which people are starting to realize that private companies probably more than ever before control people's ability to amplify their voices and whether or not their speech stays up or comes down, also what they see, and what they can listen to, and what they can read.\" </p><p>Now there has been considerable debate including an argument by the Ranking Member of this Committee just a few minutes ago that there is no censorship, that no one is engaging in--in--in a censorship. This document--and infer--fact the quote I just read I think reflects the concerns of a great many people that Google--a massive company with  monopoly power is choosing whether to amplify people's voices, whether their speech stays up or comes down, what they see, what they can listen to, and what they can read. Do you agree that's in fact what Google's doing? </p><p>BHATIA: No, Senator and this just to be clear, obviously is not--it's a quote from some third party. It's not-- </p><p>CRUZ: To be clear-- </p><p>BHATIA: --somebody at Google. </p><p>CRUZ: But Google put it in this presentation, so it presumably-- </p><p>BHATIA: To--to--to reflect the obvious discussion that is going out in general in--in society about whether  platforms in general which, you know, have on the one hand in many cases a mission--a goal--of trying to be available for free speech for--for new voices, for diversity voices to be heard. </p><p>And on the other hand, creating spaces where certain kinds of speech--violent extremists speech as an example which is clearly potentially damaging, and threatening to society, and to the community of users is not permitted. So, that's a tension--a natural tension that exists and I think it's, you know. Again, it's not our quote, but it's not an unreasonable thing to expect companies to be thinking about that. </p><p>CRUZ: All right, so let me ask the last question--my last question for the first round. You have repeatedly made reference to violent extremism and hate speech. One of the companies that has been demonetized by Google repeatedly is Prager University. And is Prager is sitting here, he will be testifying on the next panel. Mr. Prager is in my judgment, a highly learned, araldite (PH) individual, studied and well-thought on a great many issues. </p><p>And in my experience, I've always found that I learn when listening to Mr. Prager whether I happen to agree with a particular issue or yet--or not. And yet, YouTube actively censors the content Mr. Prager is producing. Is it your view that Mr. Prager is somehow disseminating dangerous ideas or--or ideas that fit into the buckets you were talking about of violent extremism or hate speech? </p><p>BHATIA: No, Senator. Maybe if I can just explain. Mr.-- </p><p>CRUZ: Please. </p><p>BHATIA: Mr. Prager is a YouTube success story. Mr. Tay (PH) Prager has more than two million followers as I understand it. Mr. Prager is--and--and all of Mr. Prager's content is available on YouTube--the--the--the--the main YouTube channel.  </p><p>We do have a very small percent of our subscribers who opt for what we call Restricted Mode. These are mostly institutions like churches or perhaps schools where there's certain  more mature content that they choose not to have access to.  </p><p>Now this is less than 2 percent of the overall YouTube watchers, but we do feel it's important that--to give those--those institutions that degree of control. There is a small percent of Mr. Prager's overall content--as I understand it, less than a quarter of his content that is deemed to be in that category of \"more mature\". </p><p>And so, for that very small percentage, they will not have access to Mr. Prager's more mature content. Other than that, it is completely--and that--and just to be clear, these are--this is content for instance, maybe perfectly acceptable to watch. But for those with perhaps references to violence, or war, or rape, things like that. </p><p>So, that's the-- </p><p>CRUZ: So, my understanding just for the record-- </p><p>BHATIA: That's the basis. </p><p>CRUZ: --is that Prager U. has produced 320 five-minute videos and that YouTube has censored 56 of them--so, roughly 20 percent. Among those that are censored include a video on the Ten Commandments.  </p><p>Another one censored includes a history on the Nation of Israel.  </p><p>The restrictions are purportedly for blocking things like pornography. But apparently, in YouTube's world, talking about the Ten Commandments and the Nation of Israel is comparable and--and--and should be blocked? </p><p>BHATIA: Respectfully Senator, that's not right. </p><p>CRUZ: Okay. </p><p>BHATIA: What I-- </p><p>CRUZ: Well, please explain. </p><p>BHATIA: So, what I--what I--what I was trying to explain is that all of Mr. Prager--those--those--the Ten Commandments--all those are available to 98 percent of YouTube viewers--98.5 I believe. </p><p>1.5 percent of our  viewers have in--have activated again, this Restricted Mode--churches, schools, maybe libraries that don't want to have their viewers exposed to more mature content. </p><p>The video--I believe the Ten Commandments video for instance, contains references to murder and I believe potentially Nazi-ism or World War II, something along those lines. There are other videos that have--in that category in the number that you referenced--56--whatever it is--that may make reference to rape. That's the reason. </p><p>But they're not censored. They are simply--they're available to everybody who's using normal YouTube. They are not available to the small subset who have chosen to activate Restricted Mode.  </p><p>CRUZ: Senator Hirono? </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. It's very clear that all of these platforms does--they do remove certain kinds of content. That is not the issue that the Chairman is trying to focus upon. And really, the premise of this hearing is not the removal of--of for example, violent speech. But the premise of this hearing is the targeted removal of conservative speech or content. So, you know, that's what the Chair would like to focus us on. </p><p>And apparently, the Ten Commandments video has Nazi imagery, so that may be one of the reasons that it's restricted. Does Google discriminate against conservatives in some way? Do you have actually have algorithm that somehow identifies--I don't know--the--the world of conservative content?  </p><p>Because you just mentioned that Mr. Prager who puts a lot of this kind of content on various platforms--that he has what? Five--two million followers and most of his content is totally available on YouTube? </p><p>So, I find it really amazing that he is here to testify that he's being targeted for content removal. So anyway, does Google discriminate against conservatives whether on Google Search, YouTube or any other platform? </p><p>BHATIA: No, Madame Senator. </p><p>HIRONO: Does Google Search discriminate against conservative content? </p><p>BHATIA: No, Madame Senator. We--we don't factor political leanings what--into our algorithms at all. </p><p>HIRONO: What role does a user's political party affiliation play in applications of Google's content moderation policies? </p><p>BHATIA: We don't know our users political, you know. We--it bears no relevance into our political--into our algorithmic returns. </p><p>HIRONO: You mentioned obviously, you're familiar with Dennis Prager. He is a witness on the second panel and he has sued Google for alleged censorship of his videos on YouTube. So, are you--you're familiar with his organization, Prager U? </p><p>BHATIA: I am. </p><p>HIRONO: Approximately, how many Prager U's videos are available on YouTube? </p><p>BHATIA: I don't have the exact number. </p><p>HIRONO: Does 672 sound, right? </p><p>BHATIA: That could be right. Yes, ma'am. </p><p>HIRONO: How much does Prager U pay to host those videos on YouTube? </p><p>BHATIA: I don't believe we charge anything.  </p><p>HIRONO: How many times have Prager U's videos been viewed on YouTube? </p><p>BHATIA: I don't have a numb--an exact number for how many views. All of them have. But again, I know that he has millions of subscribers. </p><p>HIRONO: Well, would it surprise you to learn that Prager U's videos have been viewed nearly one billion times on YouTube? </p><p>BHATIA: No, it would not. </p><p>HIRONO: Have any Prager U video--Prager U's videos been removed from YouTube--totally removed? </p><p>BHATIA: No, ma'am. </p><p>HIRONO: So, I want to show you a chart. This is a version of a chart Google submitted in the lawsuit by Mr. Prager. It shows the percentage of different organizations videos that are not available in Restrictive Mode--Restrictive Mode due to mature content. So, it shows that fewer than 23 percent of Prager U's videos are unavailable in Restrictive Mode and this is less of the percentage of videos unavailable in Restricted Mode from the Huffington Post, Fox Com--.com, The Daily Show, the Young Turks (PH), and other organizations are--that are generally viewed as liberal. </p><p>You notice that a lot more of those so-called liberal sites are--have a higher percentage. So, to your understanding, is this chart--which was submitted under penalty of perjury--accurate? </p><p>BHATIA: Yes, Senator. </p><p>HIRONO: So, if--if Google's treatment of Prager U is meant to show Google's anti-conservative bias, Google isn't doing a very good job of it.  </p><p>So, to go further, Andy Parker is in the audience and will be a witness on the second panel. Andy's daughter, Allison as I mentioned was murdered on live television while conducting an interview in 2015. Footage of that murder can still be found on YouTube today. </p><p>I understand that when Andy first approached Google about having the footage taken down, Google's response was that Andy himself should identify any videos of the murder and flag them to Google for a takedown. Google is an $8 billion company with nearly 100,000 employees. Why should a father have to search for, watch and flag videos of his daughter's murder in order to have it removed from YouTube? Why can't Google do this itself? </p><p>BHATIA: So, Senator, first of all, let me start by expressing my own--and on behalf of Google, you know, deepest sympathy for Mr. Parker for what he's gone through. The--and we have indeed, engaged with him over the course of time.  </p><p>There are a number of sets of potential concerns with different kinds of videos. So, if I can explain. The first are videos that are hoax videos. So, there were videos that were put out that is--essentially, tried to make the case that the shooting of his daughter had not happened. This videos we--violate our policies and we have indeed, taken all of those down. </p><p>The second set of videos that you're referencing are a variety of videos that may be for instance, news footage or other things of the--the shooting. And there--there are a couple of concern, you know. One is the question of copyright. In other words, are these videos that are owned potentially by Mr. Parker. I understand there is some evidence of that. </p><p>If there is, obviously we would seek to respect the copyright holder's desires. But where there are simply news videos that a major news network might have put out that would contain sort of portions of footage, that then becomes sort of the portion that we would generally tend to leave up. So, that's I think what we're trying to work our way through. </p><p>HIRONO: So, you have taken down some of this footage and the ones that you legally can take down. </p><p>BHATIA: Yes. </p><p>HIRONO: You have any--can you give us any idea of how many--what--what--whatever the right term is--how many of these individual posts that have been put up that--that you all take down?   </p><p>BHATIA: With respect to this video, I--I don't have the number. But I can happily get back to you on that. </p><p>HIRONO: I mean, are we talking about what? 100,000 of these? </p><p>BHATIA: We--in general, if you're talking about videos that--that we take down, I mean, there are hundreds of thousands of videos that get--seem to get uploaded every--every day--every week that we take down for-- </p><p>HIRONO: So-- </p><p>BHATIA: --violation of our terms one way or another. There are--just to put it into scale, every minute there are 500 hours' worth of video that is sought to be uploaded to YouTube, so. </p><p>HIRONO: Are you still taking down these kinds of videos relating to-- </p><p>BHATIA: Where we-- </p><p>HIRONO: --Allison's murder? </p><p>BHATIA: --find videos and we deploy--we deploy machine tools, you know, make algorithmic tools to make--try to capture what is violative of our--of--of--of legal restriction or policy. And we do indeed try to take them down based on those tools. </p><p>HIRONO: So, are you taking action really to--to do these or is it only as somebody points out that, \"Oh, there's another video\"? </p><p>BHATIA: No. No, Senator. I mean, there again, given the--the quantity of video that we have out there, we have to depend upon  machines effectively to try and spot--create fingerprints and then spot videos that are violative of our policies or community  guidelines rather.  </p><p>So, we certainly use that as a first instance. We then also do look to members of the community to inform us or point us to things that they also think should be taken down. And when pointed out to us, we have human reviewers look at them and--and take them down as well where violative.  </p><p>HIRONO: So--so when Mr. Parker first came to you, it was more than unfortunate that the message he got from Google is, \"Go out there and find all these yourself.\" That was definitely not a good thing-- </p><p>BHATIA: Understood. </p><p>HIRONO: --a good approach for you folks.  </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Senator Blackburn? </p><p>HIRONO: I'm sorry. Do we have seven-minute rounds? </p><p>CRUZ: We do have seven-minute rounds if you want to take some more time. </p><p>HIRONO: Sure. I thought we were on five minutes. Okay. </p><p>So, just this week we've been able to find more footage on Allison's murder on YouTube. And--and again, you know, it seems as though vis-a-vis Mr. Parker that Google has infinite resources--near infinite resources. And I would like to know that you are actively taking down on your own volition these videos. </p><p>And I think I have a screenshot of one of the videos still available on YouTube. And the person who posted the video made no attempt to hide his content. This--the title is \"Breaking: WDBJ Shooting Video Footage\". It's like screaming out there. And the description states, \"A gunman is on the loose after killing two broadcast journalists in a shooting that was captured on live television.\" </p><p>And so, I understand that content moderation can be a difficult task. But it doesn't look like it should be in this case. It's right out there. What possible explanation does Google have for why this video slipped through the cracks and has remained available on YouTube since August of 2015? </p><p>BHATIA: Again, I--I'm not familiar with this specific video--video that you've got a picture of up there, Senator. It--it--it--again, would depend upon the nature of the video that had been put up. If it was again, a hoax video of some type it clearly would transgress our policies, and would come down, and, you know, should come down. </p><p>If it is news footage that another organization had put up--  </p><p>HIRONO: Well, this--this--this is not any of those categories that you keep-- </p><p>BHATIA: If it violates--just to be clear, if it violates our policies, it should come down. I--and I wouldn't know why it would be up. </p><p>HIRONO: Uh-huh. </p><p>BHATIA: If it doesn't violate our policies, obviously would--would be a different matter. </p><p>HIRONO: So, isn't that--in and of itself, breaking the shooting footage, wouldn't that just raise-- </p><p>BHATIA: I--I--I-- </p><p>HIRONO: --a lot of red flags?  Wouldn't it-- </p><p>BHATIA: It would-- </p><p>HIRONO: --violate-- </p><p>BHATIA: It would depend really upon the nature of the video in all honesty. There are sometimes news events that would be things that might be difficult for viewers to watch, but nonetheless would be, you know, put out there on major news channels and would be probably appropriately included. But again, I can't really tell from looking at this. </p><p>HIRONO: Well, is it the same screenshot that I'm referring to? </p><p>So again, this is a screenshot from May 30, 2019. It's pretty recent showing that Andy flagged this video for Google. It appears that the only thing Google did in response is label the video as adult content and ask users to confirm their age before watching the video.  </p><p>Shouldn't--I would think this would be just taken down. And what is Google going to do to ensure that this video and others like it are removed from YouTube quickly and that they don't come back?  </p><p>So, why would you allow people to view something like this rather than taking it down? </p><p>BHATIA: Again, Senator it's difficult to comment on this specific video without knowing what it is. I--there will be videos that will be news footage that may be disturbing to people, but nonetheless is legitimate news footage in which case giving it the appropriately label may be the, you know, outcome consistent with our policies.  </p><p>On the other hand, if it is--violates and transgresses one of our policies whether it's be--whether it's the--the--the policy against hoax videos, whether it's, you know, any of the other policies that we might have, we would then look to take it down. </p><p>So again, difficult for me to say. But we're happy to look into this. </p><p>HIRONO: Why don't you look into this? </p><p>BHATIA: Yeah.  </p><p>HIRONO: Because I started again, I'm not sure where I am on the timeframe here. I think I had about two minutes left. </p><p>CRUZ: You were at seven when you stopped. </p><p>HIRONO: Oh. I'm so sorry! Oh. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Well, you all are being very nice. Thank you. </p><p>BHATIA: Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Senator Blackburn? </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bhatia, thank you for being here. </p><p>BHATIA: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>BLACKBURN: We appreciate it. About a year ago I said that I felt like 2018 marked the end of the age of innocence for the internet. And if you look forward to this summer, we've got Facebook that has been hit with the $5 billion fine from the FTC. In my opinion, that's not enough. It should've been $50 billion. We all know they've been in violation of their privacy agreements. </p><p>You all at Google are facing a Justice Department inquiry and if Microsoft's experience with their 20-year anti-trust saga is any indication, then, you know, I hope you realize this is very serious and it's a serious inquiry.  </p><p>And it seems like the problems around Big Tech--as it has become a mature industry--that they're just mushrooming. And when we talk about privacy or lack thereof, data security, lack thereof, offenders that are the biggest and the worst offenders, unfortunately for you all, people put Google at the top of the list.  </p><p>So, we appreciate that you are--that you're here. I want to start with you and talk a little bit about prioritization of search results. I think this is important to do because I will tell you I feel like you all push the boundaries until your hand gets slapped. As a mom and a grand mom , I would tell my kids, you know, \"Don't do that again\". And they would try it again and they would try it again. And that's kind of what I see with you all.  </p><p>But a big business company like you ought not to be having such childish behavior where you do something and you get your hand slapped waiting to see if we are going to get after  you or a federal agency is going to reign you back in. You're always out there pushing to the limit.  </p><p>And in doing this, you have a practice that seems that you suppress competition. And we know that you have--that Google has--through Google Plus you have prioritized search results over Yelp and Trip Advisor. You did that until local search providers really pushed back on you and said, \"You can't do that\".  </p><p>Now we see what you're doing is consolidating many of the travel offerings together. And so, you're trying to push forward to dominance in the travel market and you're doing that through an app called Trips. And now, you're going to be armed with all of these details, all of this data--all of this search data from people that use your service. And you're going to use that prioritization to wipe out competition from travel booking sites. And I'm concerned about the threat to competition that Google poses and how search prioritization harms new startups that are seeking to enter the marketplace. </p><p>So, let me ask you a couple of things. Does Google actively prioritize Google's own local search results, yes or no? </p><p>BHATIA: We seek to provide users, Senator with responses to their queries that are most relevant-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Sir, yes or no? </p><p>BHATIA: --and authoritative, so. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes or no? Do you prioritize? </p><p>BHATIA: No. No, un--unless our services--what we would put forward would be more relative and authoritative. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you. Does Google know if its own search results are better than the third-party competitors? </p><p>BHATIA: It would depend entirely on the different search that you're, you know, queries that you're looking-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: So, you have all the data. You're not quantifying and you're not prioritizing. </p><p>BHATIA: There are billions of searches that get run every day. Sometimes we would surface-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. </p><p>BHATIA: --information that we would have, sometimes others. </p><p>BLACKBURN: The answer is yes, you do prioritize and yes you do use that information. People--people aren't dumb. They can check how those search results come in.  </p><p>When the FTC investigated Google from 2011-2013, it discovered a business practice that is called Co-Occurrence Signals. That is Google products would be triggered to appear above the 10 blue links when the appearance of a competitor occurred in the page rank results. Does Google still use any fur--any form of co-occurrence signals to suppress the competition in search results? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, I--you're--you're deeper into that than I--I know the immediate answer to. I have to get back to you on that and I will tell you that the FTC-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Why don't you submit a--something in writing then for the Committee, so that we have that. This is a practice you're not supposed to be conducting at this point. You've been investigated for it.  </p><p>Okay. On Monday, you claimed in an Op Ed that Google is not politically biased. Yet you acknowledge that Google took down or limited the reach of conservative content and accounts, and only did so mistakenly.  </p><p>If you want us to believe that Google is an equal opportunity search engine and not an equal opportunity offender, let me clarify exactly what an equal playing field would look like for you all at Google. Google should equally promote video reporting in its search results whether the article is from CNN or Fox News. Do you agree? </p><p>BHATIA: We have both CNN and Fox News-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: In other words-- </p><p>BHATIA: --in our news corps. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. Should Google equally promote news articles in its search results whether the article be from The Huffington Post or Breitbart? </p><p>BHATIA: I--the--the--we surface the results-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. You don't know the answer to that one too. Did YouTube equally promote videos from Diamond and Silk at the same time as videos from John Oliver? </p><p>BHATIA: Again, both are in the corpus. What gets surfaced is most responsive. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. You don't know the answer to that one. Thank you. I'll move on. </p><p>In December 2018, reports surfaced that Google employees sought to block Breitbart from Google ads since less than one month after President Trump took office. Google employees sought to use what they called \"hate speech\" as a pretense for banning Breitbart from taking part the emails show. </p><p>Ultimately, these Google employees did not succeed in their efforts to censor Breitbart. Has your advertising platform ever enacted policy that tended to favor certain viewpoints over others? </p><p>BHATIA: No, Madame Senator. We don't use political indicia to influence our ads. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Okay. Has Google ever blacklisted or attempted to blacklist a company, group, individual or outlet from its advertising partners or its search results for political reasons? </p><p>BHATIA: No, ma'am. We don't use blacklists/whitelists to influence our search results or-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: For what reason does Google blacklist a company?  </p><p>BHATIA: We--as I said per your previous question, we do not utilize blacklists or whitelists in our search results to favor political outcomes. It's not--doesn't happen.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: I have one last question, Mr. Chairman if I have permission.  </p><p>In March 2019, Google set out to form a council on the future of artificial intelligence. That is something very important to us here at this Committee. One topic was fairness in machine learning. </p><p>BHATIA: Yes, ma'am. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Of the eight members appointed to the council, only one conservative was appointed. That was Kay Cole James. She's the president of the Heritage Foundation. She is widely respected as a leader in the conservative movement. </p><p>BHATIA: Yes. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Her appointment caused 2,500 Google employees to sign onto a letter opposing her appointment. The A.I. panel fell apart after Ms. James was unfairly tarred and targeted for her policies. </p><p>These days we hear a lot about implicit bias. </p><p>BHATIA: Uh-huh. </p><p>BLACKBURN: What has Google done to address the widespread implicit bias against conservative values that persist throughout your corporate culture? And we understand this is in the physical sense and in the virtual sense. </p><p>BHATIA: So, first of all, with respect to our corporate culture, let me again, emphasize we're 100,000  people. We are in many states around the United States including Tennessee. We are a diverse group of people with many different views.  </p><p>But we do recognize that there could potentially be challenges with implicit bias and that's precisely the reason that we construct our search engines, construct our platforms in such a way that bias does not get built in.  </p><p>And so--and core to that--core to that is the system of making sure that any change in the algorithm that could be proposed or is used is run based through a rating system--a system of search raters that consists of thousands of people throughout the United States. I think 49 states throughout the U.S. at any change to promote one change to the algorithm that's made more authoritative would need to be reviewed by all of them. </p><p>BLACKBURN: We appreciate that. And at this Committee, we're going to be looking and doing a deep dive into the issues of privacy, data security, antitrust, competition, censorship, prioritization. And we hope that you will come with an open mind to the table and be willing to work with us. I yield back. </p><p>BHATIA: Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Senator Blumenthal? </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you for having this meeting. Welcome to the Committee-- </p><p>BHATIA: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --and thank you for being here. I want to first ask you about an allegation which actually, the president surfaced on Monday. The president threatened to launch a treason investigation into Google for allegedly working with the Chinese government. The claim appears to be based on a comment and I'll ask that report of that comment be entered into the record if there's no objection. </p><p>CRUZ: Without objection. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: A political article dated July 16th, the claim appears to be based on Peter Thiel's allegation that Google has been somehow involved in treason. We know it's been a target of Chinese hacking most prominently in 2009. Have you found any evidence of infiltration of your management or your private data by Chinese intelligence? </p><p>BHATIA: Absolutely not, Senator. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Has Google made any decision about its contracts with United States government based on pressure or in consultation with China? </p><p>BHATIA: Absolutely not. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Has Google turned over or in any way turned a blind eye to a leak of its software or private data to Chinese intelligence? </p><p>BHATIA: Absolutely not. The take extremely seriously that the--the threat of any penetration of our systems. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And if Google software, private data or management is breached by a foreign intelligence agency including China, will you commit to notifying this Committee immediately? </p><p>BHATIA: Certainly, sir. And indeed, we work closely with the law enforcement agencies of the U.S.</p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And other appropriate-- </p><p>BHATIA: Yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And other appropriate agencies? </p><p>BHATIA: Yes. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. You know, I want to make an observation which I think perhaps you've already sensed from the hearing, but also from comments made well prior to this hearing by myself over months, years. But my colleagues today on both sides of the aisle, the hourglass has run out on antitrust, on privacy, on moral imperative.  </p><p>Big Tech--most particularly Google--is right now in midst of a perfect storm. And it will require a restructuring and repurposing of what you do. And I hope that you are thinking radically--if I may use that term. Not radically politically, but radically in terms of the role and responsibility that you have in modern American society because I think it has to be changed profoundly. </p><p>My complaint about the Facebook settlement so far as what we know of it right now is not the abjectly inadequate amount of the proposed penalty. Five billion dollars is barely a tap--not even a slap on the wrist. But the--the apparent lack of any structural behavior or leadership reform that will be required. We don't know precisely what the outcome will be, but I think that it is more than a missed opportunity. It is a forsaken obligation if there is no radical order to restructure and change Facebook. </p><p>On the issue that brings us here today, I want to first disclose that Robbie Parker is a former constituent of mine. His eldest daughter--his six-year-old daughter, Emily was killed in a shooting that is painful for any of us to recall, but most especially for him. So, I want to thank him, and pay tribute to his bravery, and his courage for being here a second time. </p><p>Also, in the interest of full disclosure I should tell you that the Connecticut firm representing him in his lawsuit against Alex Jones is one where one of my son's--my oldest son--works as a lawyer. But he and I have not discussed this case.  </p><p>Mr. Parker and other parents of those children repeatedly went to Google when Alex Jones and others used YouTube--YouTube to--and I'm quoting him--\"regurgitate demonstrably and undeniably false information about the Sandy Hook shooting while simultaneously attacking victims' families for profit\". </p><p>These lies were more than just false. They were malicious. They were cruel. They incited harassment, physical threats. They forced this family literally every day to relive their loss. And  as Robbie Parker told us last time he was here, for too long Google and its peers were \"complacent to the threats\". </p><p>This stuff is not speech. It's incitement, harassment, defamation. I respectfully suggest whatever your machines are, they're not working. Would you agree? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, if I may just again, our hearts go out to Mr. Parker and his family for that tragedy. We--and absolutely, we believe that hoax videos of the kind that you reference and more where he had to experience have no place on any of our platforms. And we have taken the--the challenge--the--the--the--the need to address that very seriously including most recently amending our policies earlier this year or--or--or community guidelines to make clear that any such video that comes up will be taken down immediately. </p><p>We do--again, due to the quantity of video that gets uploaded at any point in time, we have to depend on tools--on---on machines to--to try and spot those videos. We constantly are trying to improve them and--and they are improving.  </p><p>Where we miss something and it gets caught  by another, you know, a--a viewer, we then take action against it. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, speaking for Mr. Robbie Parker who's not here today, but Andy Parker is, these kinds of policies, guidelines--forgive me--platitudes are no substitute for affective enforcement. And I have said--if I've said it once, I've said it 100 times. The best policies--the best laws that we make are dead letter unless they're effectively enforced.  </p><p>I say that as someone who spent most of my time-- </p><p>BHATIA: Yeah. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --in enforcement, not legislative. And I have to conclude given what I saw before today and then what Senator Hirono showed you, that the machines are not working and that you are dependent as much on the victims coming to you. And then, often the victim's not believed or not heeded. And I guess I'm looking for a commitment that you'll do better machines or you'll have different ways of detecting and different ways of enforcing. </p><p>But again, not just guidelines or policies, but actually investing in what's needed to make these policies and guidelines real.  </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, you absolutely have our commitment--my commitment that we continue--will continue to invest in that space. I--I--I--all I can tell you is that we don't want those kinds of videos up. There's--there's--there is an--it's certainly not conducive to the kind of a community we're looking to build at YouTube. </p><p>It is--given the sheer quantity of video that gets uploaded, it is a tough computer science challenge. But we-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: But you're the ones that upload it. </p><p>BHATIA: Well, individuals will be. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: You're the ones that are responsible for it. You happen to have a provision of law that dates from the inception of the internet that gives you--in my view---a very excessively broad shield of immunity. We can debate the merits of Section 230 at another time. </p><p>But you can't simply unleash the monster and say, \"It's too big to control.\" You have a moral responsibility even if you have that legal protection. And again, with all due respect, I think there is a moral imperative here and the hourglass has run out.  </p><p>BHATIA: We--we agree that it is a responsibility that we and all platforms have to make sure that, you know, videos like that don't appear on our system. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And what specific steps are you going to take besides guidelines and policies? </p><p>BHATIA: I--I--it--it can take--it's--it--it--a lot of it will come down to improving the--the algorithms--excuse me--improving the--the--the--the--effectively the tools that make the machine learning tools that we have to spot videos--to spot violative videos. </p><p>Again, I--I will say that there's dramatic improvements happening in this space as technology improves and we are already catching far more. People will sometimes put up videos that contain snippets or will contain a bit of video and then enter slice--spliced with other forms of video and then back to the video. </p><p>And so, there are all sorts of tools that people sometimes try to utilize to get around our policies. And again, we're training machines to try and catch those as well. Ultimately, technology is going to have to be a part of the solution here and we're--we're, you know, working. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: My time is limited, but I want to ask you just a couple of more questions. Has Google committed to an independent audit of how it enforces these policies as Facebook and Twitter have promised? </p><p>BHATIA: We consult with many people on trying to figure out what the best way of meeting these challenges are, Senator, you know. So, we--we, you know, them--we look to them for input on how we're doing. We're looking for advice on how to best to make the challenges. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: What about an independent audit? Facebook and Twitter promised it. Have you committed to it? I think the answer is no. </p><p>BHATIA: Not along the lines of what exactly you're--you're referencing, I think.  </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Yeah. </p><p>BHATIA: But we do-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: The answer is no. Why not? </p><p>BHATIA: Well, are you talking about against hoax videos specifically, Senator? </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, they've committed to an independent audit of how their policies and guidelines are enforced. </p><p>BHATIA: We--we--again, the--there are a lot of </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>individual  policies and guidelines that we apply. So, YouTube community guidelines is an example. Our advertising guidelines, our search rater guidelines--there are a lot of different guidelines. Each one we utilize different forms of effectively testing and verification to see how we're doing. </p><p>So, I'm not sure that a single audit of the entirety of what our guidelines--our policies are would be--would be viable. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, they--they committed to an audit of policy guidelines on--specifically on Civil Rights which is what has brought us here today. </p><p>BHATIA: So-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Will Google commit to that same kind of audit? </p><p>BHATIA: We--we have not yet. I think it's something that we will be looking at. We certainly have a great deal of, you know. We look to--we look to the civil--we have engaged with the Civil Rights community with leadership in that community to figure out how are-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: My time is limited, so I want to ask you and I apologize for-- </p><p>BHATIA: Please. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Last month, one of your colleagues told the Commerce Committee-and I was doing some of the questioning--that recommendations for harmful misinformation have dropped \"by over 50 percent in the United States\". These are views from YouTube's recommendation system directed by YouTube itself from systems that it controls. Why have the number of views for harmful content dropped by only one half? Doesn't that--why hasn't the amount of traffic that YouTube itself is driving dropped to zero? You can control that. </p><p>BHATIA: I'm not sure I entirely follow the question, Senator. But let me see. So, the--the recommendation system that you're referencing beforehand-- </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Right. </p><p>BHATIA: --we have seen a significant diminution (PH) as we've implicated policies earlier this year that are designed to sort of get at some of these kinds of, you know, content that you're referencing before. So, maybe hoax videos or content that tends to be, you know, anti-vax kind of content, you know, marginal content significantly deprioritized as we have improved our algorithms for what is recommended. So, we have seen a significant decrease in that. We're going to continue to work on it.  </p><p>With respect to--I'm sorry. The second--I didn't follow the other part of the question. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Well, I guess the question is why haven't you reduced it to zero? And I'm going to yield back, Mr. Chairman because I (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. I'll continue to engage. Thank you, Senator. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: (INAUDIBLE) or we can pursue it in writing. </p><p>BHATIA: Please. Happy to. Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Senator Hawley? </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You said that Google takes its content moderation responsibilities very seriously. That's your testimony here today, is that fair to say? </p><p>BHATIA: We-- </p><p>HAWLEY: You started to be even-handed and neutral.  </p><p>BHATIA: We--yes, we construct our--our algorithms to be politically neutral to say-- </p><p>HAWLEY: And \"politically objective and apolitical\" I think were your exact words. </p><p>BHATIA: Exactly, yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: Is that right? And you don't--you don't oppose filters based on your political viewpoints, that's your testimony?   </p><p>BHATIA: That's correct. </p><p>HAWLEY: And despite the fact that almost exclusively, your executive's employees donate to one political party. I think 1 percent of the donations that came from Google in 2016 went to Republicans or Donald Trump. All the rest went to the other party, Hillary Clinton, the Democrats. It is your testimony that you do--you never use content moderation to advance an ideological agenda, is that correct? </p><p>BHATIA: Yes, Senator and it's, you know. We--we--it is both contrary to our mission, contrary to our business interest and it would be incompatible with the systems that we build to work political bias in there which I think is why we have third party studies-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Right. </p><p>BHATIA: --including the ones that I referenced that demonstrate that we do not have political bias in our products. </p><p>HAWLEY: And inconsistent with your basic values I imagine you would say as well? </p><p>BHATIA: Inconsistent with our values. </p><p>HAWLEY: Except for when you do it in China, right? </p><p>BHATIA: We have no-- </p><p>HAWLEY: I mean, you're happy to censor for the oppressive, authoritarian Chinese regime like for instance, with Google.cn happy to censor away any mention of Tiananmen Square, happy to help the Chinese government maintain control of all information within the company--the country, happy to help them control the information flow to their own citizens. You're happy to do all of that. Would you call that censorship with an ideological agenda? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, we don't offer almost any of our products in China. We don't offer search-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Google.CN--wait. Wait. Wait. Are you saying that Google.CN did not include censorship tools based on what the Chinese regime asked for? Is that your testimony? </p><p>BHATIA: Google-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Just remind you, you're under oath now. </p><p>BHATIA: We have not--we have not-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Google.CN did not offer--did not include censorship material? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, I don't know what you're-- </p><p>HAWLEY: You're not familiar with Google.CN? </p><p>BHATIA: I--I am--I'm using--I'm referencing the fact that we exited China in 2010 and we did so because Google at that point, we--in addition to being under attack, we felt that the censorship requirements that were being applied to Google were not compatible with this--with the products that we were able to offer. </p><p>HAWLEY: But you did offer Google.CN. You developed it and it included censorship tools that would've screened out things like mentions of Tiananmen Square, is that correct? </p><p>BHATIA: I--I'm sorry, Senator. Are you referring to Project Dragonfly? Is that-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Well, since you--I wasn't, but since you--   </p><p>BHATIA: Okay. </p><p>HAWLEY: --because that's a separate thing.  </p><p>BHATIA: Yeah. </p><p>HAWLEY: But since you mention Project Dragonfly, why don't you tell us about it? Is it active right now? </p><p>BHATIA: It's not, Senator. </p><p>HAWLEY: You're able to say that for the record it's not active? You've abandoned Project Dragonfly? </p><p>BHATIA: I mean, yes. We have--we have terminated that, so. </p><p>HAWLEY: Are--are you willing to commit today here that Google will not agree to participate in any form of censorship with the Chinese regime in China against Chinese citizens or will you commit to that? You will not agree to any information or--or restrictions on data flow in China--the Chinese market? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, I don't--I can probably imagine hypothetically what you're referencing. We don't-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Well, I was talking about Google.CN for instance. </p><p>BHATIA: We don't represent--reference China's search in China. Fundamentally in China, we actually do very little today certainly compared to any other major technology company. We really-- </p><p>HAWLEY: So, you won't block search terms for (INAUDIBLE) in concentration camps or Tiananmen Square? You won't do that in any venture--   </p><p>BHATIA: We-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --any venture going forward?   </p><p>BHATIA: We--we--we don't-- </p><p>HAWLEY: No, I'm not ask--I'm not ask--   </p><p>BHATIA: --Senator. </p><p>HAWLEY: --I'm asking you won't because we know you have in the past. That's what Google.CN was, you know. You've contemplated it with Project Dragonfly. I'm asking you now for a commitment. I'm glad to hear you say that Project Dragonfly's been cancelled. I think that's news. So, that's good to hear because there's been news reports that it's still active, so I'm delighted to hear that. </p><p>BHATIA: We've made clear that we have no current plans to go into China in the search market. </p><p>HAWLEY: That's great. So, that--that's great. And you're committing to me here today that you will not in the future do so and you will not engage in censorship in China, is that correct? </p><p>BHATIA: What I--what--what--what we are willing-- </p><p>HAWLEY: That's a yes or no actually. Yes or no. </p><p>BHATIA: --to commit to Senator is that any decision at ever look at going back into the China search market is one that we would take only in consultation with key stakeholders. </p><p>HAWLEY: Yeah. That's what you said in response to Senator Blumenthal's questions about whether or not you submit to an audit. It was the longest no in the English language. Now you're not giving me a yes or a no.  </p><p>Are--are you--let me just come back to a question that--that Senator Blumenthal asked I thought was interesting. You're confident that Google hasn't been infiltrated by a Chinese intelligence?  </p><p>BHATIA: We see no evidence of that, Senator. </p><p>HAWLEY: What--what do you think about General Dunford of the Joint Chiefs of Staff comment at the Atlantic Council a few months ago that typically--I'm quoting him, \"Typically, if a company does business in China, they are automatically going to be required to have the cell of the Communist Party in that company and that is going to lead to intellectual property from that company finding its way to the Chinese military.\" Do you--do you think he's right about that? Wrong about that? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, we don't--we do as I mentioned before, barely any business in China. So, I don't understand the basis. </p><p>HAWLEY: But you have and you have tried.  </p><p>BHATIA: In 2010, we exited the country. </p><p>HAWLEY: That wasn't--that wasn't that long ago. </p><p>BHATIA: Ten  years ago. </p><p>HAWLEY: Okay. Well, you've been--my point is this. You've been more than willing to engage in ideologic censorship in the largest market in the world. You have been more than happy to partner with the most repressive, authoritarian regime on the planet all for profits--whatever it is that is good for Google. Why would anybody believe you now when you say you won't--you won't submit to a third-party audit. You just answered Senator Blumenthal no to that.  </p><p>You won't commit to me that you won't engage in censorship when it suits your purposes in China and the Chinese market for instance, in the future. Why would anybody believe you now when you say, \"We don't ever impose an ideological agenda\"? What assurances can you give us? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, I think what I can tell you is that in China today, we don't offer any of the products that you're referencing that would-- </p><p>HAWLEY: No, I mean here. What assurances--why would we believe you now when you say in the United States or anywhere that you do business--why would we believe anything that Google says about what it does or does not do in terms of promoting an ideological agenda?  </p><p>We know you've done it in the past. We know you do it when it suits your--your bottom line. Why would we believe you now? What assurances can you--besides your own testimony? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, I--I fundamentally disagree that we're doing, you know, that these are practices for a bottom line. I--I--I will tell you that the--Google has a demonstrated track record of building search engines that meet the needs of consumers here and around the world. We are a trusted brand, you know. </p><p>I--I don't know what answer you're looking for, but it's--  </p><p>HAWLEY: Uh-huh. Well, what I'm looking for is a little honesty and what I'm also looking for is some accountability. So, let me just ask. Let me give you another shot at Senator Blumenthal's question. Will you submit to an independent third-party audit about your content moderation practices? </p><p>BHATIA: Again, we have plenty of people looking at our content moderation. </p><p>HAWLEY: You just (INAUDIBLE) which is basically a no. </p><p>BHATIA: The Economist just did a year-long study on-- </p><p>HAWLEY: The Economist is not an independent audit. They're not-- </p><p>BHATIA: It was entirely independent of Google. </p><p>HAWLEY: So, is that a yes? </p><p>BHATIA: I mean, if-- </p><p>HAWLEY: If you're happy to do it, if-- </p><p>BHATIA: If third parties want to moderate-- </p><p>HAWLEY: You'll open your books to them? </p><p>BHATIA: --and look at us-- </p><p>HAWLEY: This is big news we're going to make today. Is this a yes? </p><p>BHATIA: I-- </p><p>HAWLEY: Is this a yes? We're going to need a yes.  </p><p>BHATIA: No, I'm--I'm telling you that </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>that Google--that Google's content moderation has been looked at by-- </p><p>HAWLEY: So sad. Let me--so sad.  </p><p>Let me ask  you about YouTube and some other difficult decisions. China seems to be difficult for you. YouTube is also apparently very difficult for you. Why isn't it--what is so hard about ending the automatic referral of videos featuring minors to pedophiles? Why is that difficult? Why doesn't YouTube just do it? You--you--you know you can stop it. Why? Why won't--why won't you just do it? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, I'm not sure. We--we-- </p><p>HAWLEY: You're not familiar with this issue? </p><p>BHATIA: No, I'm familiar with the issue that you're referring to. Based on our policy decisions that we've made earlier this year, we have eliminated referencing or recommending videos that contain minors in risky situations--risky--risky conditions. </p><p>HAWLEY: Wait. So, you're telling me that you've--you've turned off the auto--you've taken them out of the algorithm, you've turned off the auto referral? You're no longer recommending them to minors? </p><p>BHATIA: Yes, not all minors. There will be situations where there's perfectly legitimate video footage containing minors. But videos that contain minors in risky situations--risky conditions-- we have stopped recommending those videos. </p><p>HAWLEY: How--how  much money does YouTube make from videos featuring children? </p><p>BHATIA: I--we don't breakdown money that way, Senator. </p><p>HAWLEY: You don't? You don't know the--you don't know what the--really? Because I thought the response to the New York Times was that it would not be--it--it--it would be devastating for your business model?   </p><p>BHATIA: I--I don't know-- </p><p>HAWLEY: You don't know? </p><p>BHATIA: --that reference. We don't--that--I can tell you that the kinds of videos that you're referencing, we don't. We have no desire to see pedophiles utilizing YouTube or-- </p><p>HAWLEY: I wouldn't have thought so either. </p><p>BHATIA: --for--and that's the reason we've taken a number of steps. </p><p>HAWLEY: How about this? Will you support--you may know that I've introduced a bill that would--that would citify (PH) this into law--steps sounds like the ones you say you've voluntarily taken. </p><p>So, will Google support that bill that would stop any company, yours or others, from automatically referring videos featuring minors in this way? </p><p>BHATIA: I'd be happy to. I haven't looked at the bill, but I would be happy to look at it and certainly it's an area, it sounds like that we have a common interest in working towards successful outcome on. </p><p>HAWLEY: Well, it's certainly an area in which the American people have an interest to protect the children, just as the American people have an interest in getting inform news--information that is free and fair. Just as the American people have an interest in having their data promote--protected.  </p><p>BHATIA: Absolutely.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Just as the American people have an interest in having companies that describe themselves as a probably American company. Those are your words. </p><p>BHATIA: Absolutely. </p><p>HAWLEY: From not doing business with, sharing secrets with, or otherwise promoting the worst most authoritarian regime on the planet, which is China. So, you know I'll disassociate myself with the remarks, but I think all of my colleagues here, clearly, trust inpatients in your company and the behavior of your monopoly has run out. It has certainly run out with me and I think it's time for some accountability. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Senator Hawley. Mr. Bhatia, you talked about the Google values being a trusted band--brand. I will tell you; I think that trust has been severely eroded. Google as I understand it was founded on a motto of don't be evil. There are more than a few Americans who have skepticism that Google is living up to that promise. You answered Senator Hawley that, well, gosh the economist and others have done studies. Did the economist have access to Google's internal records? </p><p>BHATIA: No, Senator. I believe it was done externally. They looked--they ran a series of tests based on results that they were plugging into our search engines.  </p><p>CRUZ: So, one of the very frustrating things about this topic is there are very limited data. Much of this topic gets argued by anecdote, which is a less than satisfying way to consider any topic or to consider any analysis and it yields things such as Democratic Senator saying there is no censorship. The problem is Google has all the data, as does Facebook, as does Twitter. Let me--let's--let's see if we can get a little bit of that the data. In the year 2018, how many ads by Republican officeholders did Google block? </p><p>BHATIA: How many political ads? </p><p>CRUZ: How many ads by Republican officeholders did Google bach--block? </p><p>BHATIA: I don't have the number off the top of my head. I would say the vast majority of ads that gets submitted, get.  </p><p>CRUZ: Will you commit to answering that question?  </p><p>BHATIA: We--we would be happy to come back to you.  </p><p>CRUZ: And I want the same answer. How many ads by Democrats did Google block? How many video--how many videos by Republican officeholders did the YouTube block? How many videos by Democratic officeholders did you to block? Those are objective. Data-- </p><p>BHATIA: Yeah. On the latter question, I did--we looked into that. There are--there were no videos blocked by Republicans or Democrat members of--of the Congress.  </p><p>CRUZ: Okay. So, my understanding actually is one of the members of this committee Senator Marsha Blackburn, had one of her ads blocked because you deemed it shocking content. What-- </p><p>BHATIA: Ads--ads again, distinguish ad from videos. I thought you divided those two. Ads, we have had both Democrats and Republicans on occasion be blocked. In the case of Senator Blackburn, yes, there was an ad that she submitted. It involved one of the people on the ad voicing an obscenity that-- </p><p>CRUZ: Although that was bleeped out. Is that correct? </p><p>BHATIA: That violates our policies. Well, it was clear what it was apparently and that was fine. And so, we went back, we talked to the Senator office and fix that. </p><p>CRUZ: So--let me--let me say, I appreciate your commitment to answer these questions and I'm going to ask them to you in writing. </p><p>BHATIA: Um-hum. </p><p>CRUZ: If Google will answer some straightforward questions, that provide the data, that may go a long way either to exonerating Google or to demonstrating there's a real problem. And--and not only on the metric of Republicans versus Democrats, also on the metric of how many pro-life ads has Google refused to run.  </p><p>We--this committee has heard testimony, for example, is the movie Unplanned. The true story about a former employee of Planned Parenthood. Google refused to run their ads. So, that's a question I like an answer to. How many pro-life ads did Google refused to run and how many pro-choice ads did Google refuse to run?  </p><p>Likewise, how many pro-Israel ads has Google refused to run? How many--how many anti-Israel ads? Those data--right now, Google is a black box, and nobody knows. Let me ask another question. What was the average add rate Google charged the Trump Campaign in--in the 2016 campaign?  </p><p>BHATIA: Add--ad rates Senator are set by auction. So, Democrats, Republicans, it's--it's entirely based on when they would want to run it.  </p><p>CRUZ: There is an average ad rate, that is a number. It would be the average of the rate you charged across the board. And I'm going to ask you in writing, what was the average ad rate the Trump Campaign paid and the--the Clinton Campaign paid? And if those two numbers are roughly equal, that will indicate one thing. If those two numbers are wildly different, that may indicate something else. And right now, it is Google that knows that. And--and as far as I know nobody else.  </p><p>BHATIA: If I may again, just on ads specifically, all ads or not the same. In other words, if you are running a banner headline on YouTube that may be a higher price than a lower, less price.  </p><p>CRUZ: If--if--you like-- </p><p>BHATIA: So, it's a matter of going to be like for like.  </p><p>CRUZ: That would be fabulous. And you're more than welcome to break it down the average banner ad rate for the Trump Campaign was X and the average--if they're three--three different types of ads, break it down and whatever category, but compare apples to apples.  </p><p>BHATIA: And if I could also Senator, we do have all of the advertising spending for all members on our website, where we publicize this. There's a transparency report that we put out annually on spending by--candidates. It's all up there. Welcome to--we would be happy to point it out to your staff.  </p><p>CRUZ: Now--now--now let me ask you. You know, some have asked well, gosh who would possibly think that Google was discriminating against conservative views. --The senior leadership at Google, does it lean left, or does it lean right?  </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, senior leadership that the whole team consists of people from a variety of different perspectives, from outside the United States, from Americans-- </p><p>CRUZ: Mr. Bhatia, you are doing something rather remarkable, which is your man--managing to be less candid than Mark Zuckerberg. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, when he testified before this committee ,admitted Silicon Valley is overwhelmingly liberal and anyone operating in the realm of--of simple reality would acknowledge that. Would you agree with that? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, I go back to 100,000 people, 70, 80 different countries, leadership teams pulled from all over the world, I don't think it's an--a matter of easy caricature. The days when we were just a Silicon Valley company has changed.  </p><p>CRUZ: Okay. Let--let--let--let's--let's focus on--on some simple data. It's where data is helpful. I did a FEC analysis in 2016, of senior executives at Google. People who had the title of some form of Executive, Vice President, or Director, found at least 88 unique senior--senior officials at Google who made contributions to the Hillary Clinton Campaign. 88. Do you know how many--how many senior executives at Google made contributions to the Trump Campaign? </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, it's not my business to look into that.  </p><p>CRUZ: Care to field a guess? Zero. Goose egg. Not a single one. This isn't close that you can't say, gosh, I don't know anything about the politics here. That--that is disconnected from reality. Let's look at other--at another example. Senator Blackburn asked about the Advisory Council that you put together on artificial intelligence. One of the people on the Advisory Council was Kay Coles James. </p><p>BHATIA: Um-hum. </p><p>CRUZ: Who is the head of the Heritage Foundation? </p><p>BHATIA: Yes sir.  </p><p>CRUZ: You worked at the Heritage Foundation; I believe you said. </p><p>BHATIA: I did. </p><p>CRUZ: Do you consider the Heritage Foundation some fringe organization?  </p><p>BHATIA: No, Senator. I consider it a conservative organization. </p><p>CRUZ: So, 2500 Google employees signed a petition to have Ms. James removed from the Council and they said, \"by appointing James to the ATEA, Google elevates and endorses her views, implying that hers is a valid perspective, worthy of inclusion in its decision-making.\" This is unacceptable. So, you have 2500 employees at Google saying that Ms. James, who by the way is an African American woman, was one of the first women to desegregate the Richmond Public Schools. 2500 Google employees saying that her view is not valid or worthy of inclusion. Google in response to this dissolved the entire committee. Do you understand when you see that kind of bias saying a conservative African American woman's views are not valid and not worthy of inclusion, that the American people would say these guys are silencing voices they disagree with?  </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, the 2300 amounts to something around 2 percent of the Google employees. </p><p>CRUZ: But Google acted on their recommendations.  </p><p>BHATIA: No, Senator.  </p><p>CRUZ: They dissolved the committee. </p><p>BHATIA: We did not, Senator. What happened in that situation was it was a committee that consisted of a number of--of members. As time progressed, a number of members of the committee, other than Ms. James decided to--re--to--to fall off the committee--to withdraw from the committee. So-- </p><p>CRUZ: So, is--is it your testimony, Mr. Bhatia because I'm finding this--this--this difficult to credit. Is it your testimony that you--that Google did not dissolve the committee because your employees were mad that anyone right of center was included? </p><p>BHATIA: We dissolved the committee, Senator. I think we were clear at the end of the day that--that--that it was not going to be viable to continue the--the--the Council given what we were seeing happening with other members of the committee.  </p><p>CRUZ: In March 18 email, to at least 17 other Google employees, Google employee Liam hot--Hopkins stated that, \"pay--Prager U, Jordan Peterson, and Shapiro at all are all Nazis.\" This is a quote. \"Are using dog whistles.\" He further suggested that Google isolate this quote far right content. Is it your judgment that Mr. Prager, Mr. Peterson, and Mr. Shapiro are Nazis? </p><p>BHATIA: No Senator.  </p><p>CRUZ: At least two of the three Mr. Prager and Mr. Shapiro are Orthodox Jews. Are you familiar with any Orthodox Jews who are Nazis?  </p><p>BHATIA: No Senator.  </p><p>CRUZ: Is that not a horrifically offensive nutty statement?  </p><p>BHATIA: Senator, we have 100,000 people in the company and there are 5,7 times the number of people who work in Congress. We have people who will say things on you know chat rooms, and other things that-- </p><p>CRUZ: So, there were--there were at least 17 Google employees on that email. Did even one of them object to this characterization?  </p><p>BHATIA: I don't know whether they did or not, Senator. We have a lot of these chat rooms that go on. People say things in chat rooms that certainly don't reflect the views of the company. You know, that--it's--it's not unlike many other workplaces around the world. What--people may say things that--you know don't reflect the views of the leadership team and management. We're--you know, it is what it is.  </p><p>CRUZ: Do you understand why people would be skeptical of Google's judgment and the radical politics of Google employees when you believe Orthodox Jews like Mr. Prager and Mr. Shapiro are secretly Nazis. </p><p>BHATIA: Again, Senator, this is a statement that was made by an individual employee on some chat room, board.  </p><p>CRUZ: Google Executive Jen Gennai, was videoed saying that Google is \"training its algorithms\" with an eye to prevent something like 2016 from happening again. Is that what Google is working to do? Oh, and here--here's the quote. \"We're also training our ag--algorithms, like, if 2016 happened again, would we have, would the outcome be different.\"  </p><p>BHATIA: So, Senator, this was taken I believe from the project Veritas videos. Where Mr. Gennai was--who is a--Google employee without responsibility for our search algorithms, was secretly videotaped without her consent. Her reference that you're quoting here and that the video subsequent made, was to activities that we have undertaken to make sure that election interference that would seem foreign state interference in elections that was seen in 2016, does not happen again. That's what the reference is to.  </p><p>CRUZ: Well, I--I think one of the best things to come out of this hearing, is your commitment to answer the clear and direct questions from this committee, with real numbers and specific hard data on Google's practices. That will go a long way to providing transparency that has for too long been missing. And let me echo both Senator Blumenthal and Senator Hawley, that I would strongly advise Google to submit to an independent third-party audit, that has no bias, that has no ax to grind, with access to Google's records. An audit that doesn't have access to the record is meaningless. Your competitors are doing so, and I believe the American people expect transparency from all of Big Tech. Senator Hirono.  </p><p>HIRONO: Just for clarification. So, my understanding is that Google has a very different business model than Twitter or Facebook. So, while those entities can agree to a third-party audit that would include I guess content, looking into their--their records in a way that--that they can that--that still enables them to retain their, I don't know the business methods or whatever it is, but you're in a very different kind of category. Is that why you are having such a hard time saying that you would sub--submit to a third--party audit of--your content moderation practices?  </p><p>BHATIA: Well, Senator, we are in a very different business. We're not a social media platform, the way you--the other companies Facebook and Twitter you referenced are. We're actually many different platforms that we have Gmail, Android.  </p><p>HIRONO: Um-hum.  </p><p>BHATIA: So, there are a lot of different parts to our business. Certainly, that adds to the complication.  </p><p>HIRONO: So, you--you were asked whether--regarding your ads. Okay. I understand that--that the business motto is--is very different. So, you were asked whether you know you've taken down pro-life, pro-choice, pro-Israel, anti-Israel ads. Do you have an algorithm that actually flags out these words?  </p><p>BHATIA: No.  </p><p>HIRONO: Or-- </p><p>BHATIA: No Senator. </p><p>HIRONO: So, how would you even be able to respond to a question if your--your algorithms don't even flag out these kinds of--these adds based on these identifying terms.  </p><p>BHATIA: Yeah, we--again, we--we--are--as I explained before, what we do trying to do is--what we do is create algorithms to try and surface the most responsive results. We don't factor in you know whether they contain the word Israel or abortion or any of the other thing. So, it's--it's--they're not constructed that way.  </p><p>HIRONO: So, Google is a multibillion-dollar business. So, regardless of your employees exercising their First Amendment rights to put whatever--whatever things that they want to put out there, you don't even agree with I mean Google is a business. Does it even--does it make business sense for Google to start doing content moderation that's based on somebody's political affiliations or that--their views? Does that even make sense?  </p><p>BHATIA: Absolutely not. And you know if we--if we lose user trust, it will be damaging to our business.  </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you.  </p><p>BHATIA: Thank you.  </p><p>CRUZ: All right. Thank you, Mr. Bhatia. </p><p>BHATIA: Thank you.  </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you for your testimony. I appreciate you coming. The Senate is right now in the midst of three--three votes. So, what we're going to do is we're going to briefly recess this committee, go and--and cast those votes. </p><p>HIRONO: (OFF-MIC) Three votes. </p><p>CRUZ: There's three votes, so we're at the tail end of the first vote and so we will vote on those three. I will ask the members of the committee to vote at the very beginning of the third vote and as soon as we do so, we will come back and convene the second panel. So, but--but for now, the--the committee is temporarily recessed.  </p><p>BHATIA: Thank you. </p><p>(RECESS) </p><p>CRUZ: Good afternoon everyone and welcome back. I would ask each of the witnesses for the second panel to please take your seats. I apologize for that delay. While we went through the three votes we had. We will now begin the second panel of five witnesses. Each witness will have a five-minute opening statement, followed by rounds of questions.  </p><p>Our first witness is Mr. Dennis Prager. Dennis Prager is a best-selling author, a columnist, and a nationally syndicated radio talk--talk show host. He is also the co-founder Prager University, an institution of higher learning on the Internet that produces five-minute videos in which experts distill complex topics in political science, history, philosophy, religion, economics, and psychology. Mr. Prager was previously appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the U.S. Delegation to the Vienna Review Conference on the Helsinki Accords. He was also appointed by President George W. Bush to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council.  </p><p>Our second witness is Jason Kint. Jason Kint is the CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade association that serves the unique needs of digital content companies. Before joining Digital Content Next in 2014, Mr. Kint served in various executive roles, including as General Manager and Senior Vice President at CBS Interactive and as the Director of Online Publishers Association. He is a graduate of Washington University in St. Louis.  </p><p>Our third witness is Mr. Andy Parker. Mr. Parker is the father of Allison Parker. In 2015, Allison was tragically shot and killed during a live TV broadcast. Mr. Parker now travels across the country to advocate on gun control issues and have been working tirelessly to remove footage of his daughter's murder from YouTube and other Internet sites. Mr. Parker recently published a book about his daughter's life and leg--legacy entitled For Allison: The Murder of a Young Journalist and a Father's Fight for Gun Safety.  </p><p>Our third witness is Doctor Francesca Tripodi, who is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at James Madison University and an Affiliated Researcher at Data and Society. Doctor Tripodi's research focuses on how partisan groups interact with the media and the role that community plays in understanding what constitutes news and information. Both She received a PhD and an MA from the University of Virginia, an MA in Communication, Culture, and Technology from Georgetown University, and a BA in Communications from the University of Southern California.  </p><p>Our final witness is Doctor Robert Epstein. Doctor Epstein is the--an Author, Editor, and longtime Psychology Researcher and Professor. He is currently a Senior Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and he is a Contributing Editor for the Scientific American Mind. He is also the Founder and Director Emeritus of the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies in Massachusetts and the Former Editor-in-Chief of Psychology today.  </p><p>Mr. Prager, we'll start with you.  </p><p>PRAGER: (OFF-MIC) Thank you, Mr. Chairman (INAUDIBLE--)  </p><p>HIRONO: Microphone. </p><p>PRAGER: (OFF-MIC) Oh, I thought I'd put it on. Ah, okay. Do I get my 20 seconds back? </p><p>CRUZ: You--you--you would think a radio host would know how to do that. </p><p>PRAGER: You would. You would. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>That is a very fine point. I have no response.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I will take just a moment, because my opening comment is under five minutes, just to respond on the issue of the 10 commend mint--10 Commandments video that was placed on the restricted list by Google. The representative from Google mentioned that--a reason that it would be on the restricted list was that it contains mentions of murder. So, I was thinking. I have a solution that will I think appeal to Google. I will re-release it as the nine commitments. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>That should solve the problem of including murder in my discussion of the 10 Commandments. And as regards to swastika. Yes, there is a swastika. It is again in the commandment of do not murder wherein that murder--there are people that believe murder is all right even today and I use the swastika and the--and the hammer and sickle as two examples. I would think we would want young people to associate the swastika with evil. That was why I had a swastika. </p><p>It is an honor to be invited to speak in the United States Senate, but I wish I were not so honored. Because the subject of this hearing Google and YouTube, and for that matter Twitter and Facebook, suppression of Internet content on ideological grounds threatens the future of America more than external enemy. In fact, never in American history has there been a stronger threat to freedom of speech as there is today. Before addressing this, however, I think it important that you know a bit about me and the organization I co-founded.  </p><p>Prager University, Prager U as it is often referred to. I was born in Brooklyn, New York. My late father Max Prager was a CPA and an Orthodox Jew, who volunteered to serve in the U.S. Navy at the start of World War II. My father's senior class thesis at the City College of New York, was on anti-Semitism in America. Yet despite his keen awareness of the subject, he believed that Jews living in America were the luckiest Jews to have ever lived.  </p><p>He was right. Having taught Jewish History at Brooklyn College, written a book on anti-Semitism, and fought Jew hatred my whole life. I thank God for living in America. It breaks my heart that a vast number of young Americans have not only not been taught how lucky they are to be Americans but have been taught either how unlucky they are or how ashamed they should be. It breaks my heart for them because contempt for one's country leaves a terrible the hole in one's soul and because ungrateful people always become unhappy and angry people. And it breaks my heart for America because no good country can survive when its people have contempt for it. </p><p>I have been communicating this appreciation of America for 35 years, as a radio talk show host. The last 20 in National Syndication with the Salem Radio Network, an organization that is a blessing in American life. One reason I started Prager U was to communicate America's moral purpose and moral achievements. Both for young Americans and to young people around the world. With 1 billion views a year and with more than half of the viewers under age 35, Prager U has achieved some success.  </p><p>My philosophy of life is easily summarized, God wants us to be good. Period. God without goodness is fanaticism and goodness without God will not long endure. Everything I and Prager U do emanates from belief in the importance of being a good person. That some label us  extreme or \"haters\" only reflects on the character and the broken moral compass of those making such accusations. They are the haters and extremists.  </p><p>Prager U releases a five-minute video every week. Our presenters include three former Prime Minister's, four Pulitzer Prize Winners, Liberals, Conservatives, Gays, Blacks, Latinos, Atheists, Believers, Jews, Christians, Muslims, and professors and scientists from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, and a dozen other universities. Do you think the Secretary General of NATO or the former Prime Ministers of Norway, Canada, or Spain, or the late Charles Krauthammer, or Philip Hamburger, distinguished Professor of Law at Columbia Law school would make a video for extreme or hate filled site? The idea is not only preposterous, it is a smear.  </p><p>Yet Google, which owns YouTube has restricted access to 56 of our 325-minute videos and to other videos we produce. Restrictive means families that have a filter to avoid pornography and violence cannot see that video. It also means that no school or library can show that video. Google has even restricted access to a video on the 10 Commandments as we have seen. Yes, the 10 Commandments.  </p><p>We have repeatedly asked Google, why our videos are restricted. No explanation is ever given, but of course we know why. Because they come from a conservative perspective. The liberals and conservatives differ on many issues, but they have always agreed that free speech must be preserved.  </p><p>While the left has never supported free-speech, liberals always have. I therefore appealed to liberals to join us in fighting on behalf of America's crowning glory, free speech. Otherwise, I promise you one day you will say, first they came after conservatives, and I said nothing. And then, they came after me, and there was no one left to speak up for me. Thank you.  </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Prager. Mr. Kint.  </p><p>KINT: Good afternoon, Senator Cruz, Ranking Member Hirono, and Members of the Committee. Thank you, for the opportunity to appear before you today.  </p><p>I am the CEO of Digital Content Next and I'm here to speak on behalf of high-quality digital publishers. DCN is the only association is conclusively focused on the future of publishing. Our members include some of the most trusted brands on the web. Hundreds of them large and small, old and new. From the Wall Street Journal to the New York Times, Disney, Warner Media, NBC, and Fox. To native digital publishers like the Insider and IJR in the Texas Tribune. </p><p>I was invited here today to specifically address Google, a company which reaches billions of people across its platforms on which it determines the rules and limits access to its massive data pool. At the same time, Google leverages this data to \"compete\" against those who depend on its platforms. The web was supposed to be competitive and open, but it simply lost much of that vision as Google's dominance has grown. Google is the primary gatekeeper to any digital content business in four ways which I'll cover today. I'll call them the four D's. Discovery and design of the content and then the data and the dollars that come from consuming the content.  </p><p>First, discovery. Prior to my move to Washington, I spent over 20 years running digital media businesses. Like publishers today, we had entire teams focused on optimizing content for the maximum clicks from Google search. As it controls more than 90 percent of the search market. Over time, Google has pushed search results off the first screen in favor of more lucrative Google ads and Google's own properties.  </p><p>Second, design. Google more than any company influences the design of our members content. Google's web browser chrome is responsible for more than 60 percent of the traffic on the web. Therefore, publishers design their websites to work best inside of Google's browser. With the-- with the increase of mobile device usage, Google even developed its own code for the mobile web, which promises even better search results for the publishers who choose to adopt it furthering their grip on the web.  </p><p>Third, data. Today personal data is collected and used to micro target users across the web as cheaply as possible. Our industries opaque data-driven ecosystem has mostly benefited intermediaries, primarily Google, at the expense of publishers and advertisers. Last month, for the first time, we saw empirical research that demonstrated this. Google's revenue concentration ties directly to its ability to collect day--to collect data in ways that no one else can.  </p><p>It's important to understand that Google owns the top five domains on the web that track us, on more than 75 percent of the top 1 million websites. They see much of what we do. Data is the source of Google's power and the leverage it to the hilt. With this in mind, the industry's rules around privacy and data are heavily determined by Google's best interest. Legal teams at publishers are forced to adopt Google's rules or choose not to do business with Google. In other words, there is no choice.  </p><p>Finally, and forth the dollars. We've been on record since 2015, describing the duopoly of digital advertising, where almost all the incremental growth in our industry is going to Google and Facebook. But in the case of Google, it has cornered the advertising server market. On the supply side, advertising teams are optimizing for Google's ad server and the often-opaque business rules and measurements that Google establishes.  </p><p>And on the demand side, because Google oversees more advertising demand than any of the top five advertising agencies, Google is able to in effect set the prices of ads in the auction markets. Google determines the rules of their auctions with full knowledge whether or not they will help Google, or they will help publishers. It can't be both. To make matters worse, all these products hinge on Google's algorithms, which are shrouded in a proprietary black box of secrecy, which absorbs most of the data across the web and spits out profits according to how Google decides to tune them.  </p><p>In closing, I want to thank Chairman Cruz and Ranking Member Hirono, for convening today's hearing. From my perspective, it's abundantly clear that Google dominates the digital landscape and uses that dominance to enhance its own bottom line, to the detriment of the marketplace, and most importantly consumers. In the absence of meaningful competition or constraints, the question we as a society must be asking ourselves, is whether we're comfortable with the world Google is creating for us. It is time to end Google's stranglehold on digital media. I thank you and I look forward to your questions.  </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Kint. Mr. Parker.  </p><p>PARKER: Mr. Chairman, Ranking mender--Member Hirono, and Senator Blackburn. Thank you all for hearing my testimony today. In August 2015, my daughter, Journalist Allison Parker was shot and murdered while recording on live television. The unimaginable pain felt by my family was amplified after the killer uploaded a first-person video of the murderer to YouTube.  </p><p>I pledge to honor my daughter's memory and advocate for sensible gun laws, so that others wouldn't suffer the same fate as Allison. In response to my advocacy, countless people have targeted me, my family, and Allison's boyfriend online. Claiming that Allison's death was part of the con-spirit--conspiracy to seize their guns. They have taken the gruesome footage of my daughter's murder, edited it into videos and flooding YouTube and other social media platforms with hate filled diatribes maligning us.  </p><p>As the company with a virtual monopoly on Internet search and online video hosting, Google has a duty to make sure the information they make accessible to the world is based on facts and not harmful conspiracy theories. I implored Google and YouTube to take down the footage of her murder and the related conspiratorial cons--content. Their response was to suggest that I view and flag the content I found offensive. Instead of self-policing, they put the onus on me. In essence, they wanted me to watch my daughter's murder and explain to a robot why it should be removed. I never have, nor ever--nor will I ever watch any of it, for obvious reasons.  </p><p>So, in 2017, I reached out to Lenny Posner, whose son Noah was murdered in Sandy--the Sandy Hook shooting and the honor network who worked long hours flagging videos, so--so that I was spared. Although hundreds of videos have been taken down due to their diligence. They are often stymieing even--even with an enforceable copyright. I've engaged in direct communications with Google regarding the proliferation of these videos, but while they profess a desire to help, in reality they do nothing.  </p><p>On May 1st, of this year, in the company of Georgetown University civil rights Law clinic, I had videoconferences--conference with representatives from Google regarding specific content and our attempts to have it removed. Their response was, we're really trying. Since that meeting there has been nothing but silence until coincidental--coincidentally not so, but today we got an email from them at 9:47 AM. Thanks to section 230, Google has complete immunity and therefore no incentive to respond and you saw some of the examples earlier in utter fail--failure of their AI, one video self-flagged by Google, then later the flag was removed.  </p><p>Some videos were not removed and instead given this label: this video may be inappropriate for some users. That was also shown today. Which is tantamount to a perverse invitation to click and watch. The video has had over 700,000 views and was still--and was specifically pointed out to Google and our teleconference and it's still up as we speak.  </p><p>I understand that the general purpose of this hearing is to consider whether Internet gatekeepers such as Google should or should not censor the speech of the politically unpopular. However, it is important to note that turning a blind eye to targeted harassment over the Internet. In the name of preserving free speech, has real world and life altering consequences. Furthermore, this harassment itself is--has a significant chilling effect on free speech and public advocacy of the people these conspiracy theorists target. Even though some on this committee may not agree with my cause, they must recognize that the harassment and threats of violence I faced, was an attempt to attempt--to intimidate me, prevent me from telling Allison's story, and speaking out against gun violence, and to silence my free speech rights.  </p><p>I recognize the First Amendment gives everyone the right to publicly speculate that the moon landing didn't happen or the Earth is flat, but there's a difference between someone venting about a favorite conspiracy theory and Google turning its platforms over to anonymous users for them to target and harass victims of public tragedies. The former is free speech. The latter is violence. As more and more public tragedies and horrific mass shootings occur, they will be recorded, broadcasted, and disseminated on platforms like YouTube. Like so much cheap entertainment for Google to use to add a few more millions to their bottom line.  </p><p>Google--profits massively off of lack of reg--regulation. If it cannot properly protect citizens from online harassment, hate speech, and moment of death videos, I call on Congress to step in and make sure these--that proper protections are in place for private citizens like me, who are continually harassed and exploited. Currently, platforms like Google are protecting against civil or criminal liability under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Removing the section 230 protection, will allow users to hold Google responsible for the conspirial--conspiratorial content it allows on its platforms.  </p><p>Mr. Chairman, there may not be a lot of issues that you and I agree on, philosophically that is, but we do agree on this. We should protect the First Amendment, but it's time for Google and social media to be regulated. It's the original founders as you mentioned earlier, had a motto. Their original motto was \"don't be evil.\" This motto was replaced in 2015, by \"do the right thing.\" Google fails miserably on both counts. Thank you, sir. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Parker and thank you for sharing your powerful story and--and your powerful testament to your daughter. </p><p>PARKER: Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Doctor Tripodi. </p><p>TRIPODI: Good evening. It is an honor to return before the Senate Committee to discuss my research. During the last hearing and today, conservatives have claimed that Google is biased. Scholars, such as Doctor Epstein, argue that this bias has the capacity to sway elections.  </p><p>My research also confirms that people trust algorithmic output. But where we differ is that my research demonstrates that the phrases we choose are encoded with bias before they hit the browser. Epistemological frameworks shape what we will search for, how, and why. And simple shifts and syntax's, dramatically change what Google will return to us.  </p><p>For example, in the fall of 2017, if one were to Google NFL ratings down. All of the top returns supported President Trumps claims that the anthem protest hurt NFL ratings. However, if you searched, NFL ratings up. Google returned entirely different headlines, supporting the position.  </p><p>When you Google for information about conservative censorship, the top returns are conservative news that support this claim. Google the phrase Prager U, and you get their website, their twitter account, there YouTube channel, and their Wikipedia check--page. Those interested in learning more from conservative thinkers have ample access to show--do so. My data show, that users, shape our own realities. Because we teach Google what we want to see based on the keywords that we enter.  </p><p>My findings also indicate that the process of matching keywords to content can be gamed to maximize exposure. For example, the phrase AOC, returns conservative videos on YouTube. Even though this is the Twitter handle of Representative Ocasio-Cortez. This matching is not accidental.  </p><p>By partnering with the data scientist, I have obtained and analyzed to the metadata of 13 different YouTube channels, including thousands of videos and in this data you can see that Fox News is 6.7 times more likely to use AOC as a search engine optimization tag than MSNBC. Thereby increasing the probability that searching for the phrase will link audiences to conservative news coverage of a liberal politician. YouTube have a vested interest in keeping people on the site for as long as possible, and intentionally feeds audiences content they can't stop watching. Producers also want to commodify their content, to maximize exposure and conservative channels cross promote guests and ideas in order to feed these algorithmic connections.  </p><p>Now, as a marketing strategy, this is not nefarious. But because they also host far right thinkers and provide them a platform to validate their opinions. It amplifies those ideas is well. That is because YouTube is a social media network of content creators, featured guest, as well as users who comment, like, or share the videos.  </p><p>Freedom of speech is one of the fundamental rights designed by our forefathers. It is crucial for allowing Americans to express both widely accepted and unpopular opinions, without fear of government punishment or censorship. However, privately held corporations like Facebook, Google, and Twitter are not the new public square. They are sophisticated advertising firms designed to profit from the data we provide to them.  </p><p>They are also spaces where people can create mass followings and those who want to profit from YouTube must adhere to their terms of service. These terms are not written to disenfranch--to disenfranchise conservatives. These policies were created in the interest of safeguarding members of protected groups and are designed to reduce hatred, harassment, discrimination, and violence.  </p><p>In sum, what we get from Google depends primarily on what we search and depending on what you search conservatism thrives online. For progressive nonprofits, conservative media are the Goliaths. Well-funded companies with large production budgets and sophisticated digital marketing campaigns. This is why YouTube's top returns for phrases like gender identity or social justice are conservative videos. Click on these videos and YouTube doesn't try to steer the audience left, it auto plays a steady stream of conservative ideas.  </p><p>Simply put, if content is readily available, it is not being suppressed. What conservatives who are arguing censorship are frustrated with, is not the constitutional right to free speech, but is actually a grievance against a free market economy. The right for everyone to speak their ideas does not guarantee the right to captivate a large audience, nor the right to profit from them. Given how YouTube tries to keep audiences on their platform.  </p><p>I think we can all agree that a more pressing issue for this committee to pay attention to, is how metadata can amplify hate speech, pedophilia, conspiracy theories, and disinformation. Thank you, so much for your time.  </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Dr. Epstein. </p><p>EPSTEIN: (OFF-MIC) I am indeed Dr. Robert Evan Stein-- </p><p>CRUZ: Please--please turn your microphone on.  </p><p>EPSTEIN: I am indeed Dr. Robert Epstein. The most important thing for you to know about me is that I'm the father of five wonderful children. As it happens, I'm also a Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology. I have been center, center left my whole adult life, but I value my country and democracy more than I value any party or candidate. That is why I'm speaking out today. I'm here to explain why Google poses a serious threat to democracy, how monitoring systems can protect us from companies like Google, and how Congress can immediately end Google's worldwide monopoly on search.  </p><p>My plan for ending that monopoly was published, just yesterday, in Business Week. I respectfully request that my article be entered into the congressional record. It's attached to my full testimony.  </p><p>CRUZ: It will be entered without objection.  </p><p>EPSTEIN: I've been a Research Psychologist for nearly 40 years. My PhD is from Harvard and since 1981, I've published extensively on AI and other topics. Some of my research has focused on Google. On the company's massive surveillance operations, censorship capabilities, and unprecedented ability to manipulate the thinking of 2.5 billion people. Soon to be four plus billion.  </p><p>I've written article--articles about Google for Time Magazine, USA Today, that kind of thing, but also for the Daily Caller and even Russia's Sputnik News. I reach out to diverse audiences because I believe the threats posed by Google and to a lesser extent Facebook, are so serious that everyone needs to know about them. Here are just three disturbing findings for my research, which adheres to the very highest standards of scientific integrity.  </p><p>Number one. In 2016, Google search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that shifted at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton, whom I supported. I know this because I preserved more than 13,000 election related searches prior to election day and Google's search results were significantly biased in favor of Secretary Clinton. I know the number of votes that shifted because I've conducted dozens of controlled experiments that measure how opinions shift when search results are biased. I call the shift SEME, the Search Engine Manipulation Effect, which I first published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015.  </p><p>Biased search results can easily produce shifts in the opinions and voting preferences of undecided voters by up to 80 percent in some demographic groups because people blindly trust high-ranking search results over lower ones. SEME is an especially dangerous form of influence because it is in effect subliminal. It also leaves no paper trail for authorities to trace. It's an example of a short-lived or \"ephemeral experience.\"  </p><p>That's a phrase you'll find in internal emails that have leaked recently from Google. I'm now studying seven such manipulations like SEME and unlike billboards or those Russian placed ads, these manipulations are invisible and noncompetitive. They're controlled entirely by Big Tech companies and there is no way to counteract them.  </p><p>Number two. On election day in 2018, the Go Vote reminder that Google displayed on its homepage, gave one political party at least 800,000 more votes, than it gave the other party. That reminder was not a public service. It was a vote manipulation. </p><p>Number three. In the weeks leading up to the 2018 election, bias in Google search results may have shifted upwards of 78.2 million votes, spread across many races, to the candidates of one political party. This number is based on bias in data captured by my 2018 monitoring system, which preserved more than 47,000 election related searches conducted by a diverse group of American voters. I know how to stop Big Tech in its tracks. And that brings me briefly here to monitoring systems and the proposal I published yesterday. A 2015, phone call from the Attorney General of Mississippi, prompted me to start a year's long project, in which I have learned how to capture online ephemeral experiences.  </p><p>In early 2016, I deployed a system that allowed my team to look over people's shoulders as they conducted online searches with their permission, I deployed a more sophisticated system in 2018, and I'm raising funds now to build a much more comprehiss--comprehensive system in 2020. One that will allow us to catch Big Tech in the act, to instantly spot when Facebook is biasing newsfeeds, or when Twitter is suppressing tweets sent by Ann Coulter or Elizabeth Warren. This system must be built to keep an eye on Big Tech in 2020, because if these companies all support the same candidate, they will have the power to shift 15 million votes to that candidate. To let Big Tech, get away with subliminal manipulation on this scale, would be to make the free and fair election meaningless.  </p><p>Finally, regarding yesterday's article. Congress can quickly end Google's worldwide monopoly on search by declaring Google's massive search index, the database the company uses to generate search results to be a public comment, access--accessible by all. Just as in 1956, consent decree forced AT&amp;T to share all its patents. There is precedent in both law and Google's business practices to justify taking this step, which will make online search competitive again and dramatically diminish Google's power worldwide.  </p><p>In 1961, Eisenhower warned about the possible rise of a technological elite that would control public policy without people's awareness. That elite now exists, and you must determine where we go from here. Chairman Cruz, Ranking Member Hirono, Mrs. Blackburn, other Members of the Committee. Democracy as originally conceived cannot survive Big Tech as currently empowered. I look forward to your questions.  </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, very much for that fascinating testimony. Senator Blackburn has asked that she might go earlier, so I'll yield my time to her and I'll ask my questions later in this round.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. We've got a telephone town hall with Tennesseans and I--but I did not want to miss hearing your testimony because I think this is a tremendously important topic and one that Congress--time has arrived for Congress to take some action and to focus on appropriate light touch regulation to hold Big Tech responsible.  </p><p>And Mr. Epstein--Dr. Epstein, I agree with you. They are manipulators. It is not lost on me that Mark Zuckerberg at one point said Facebook worked more like a government than a corporation, and it is a very manipulative one.  </p><p>And Dr. Tripodi, I--I will tell you I agree with you too. They are nothing but big advertising companies and you know their business model is pretty much built on greed.  </p><p>And Mr. Parker, I say my heart breaks for you. I very much remember--very vividly remember seeing that footage with Allison and I can only imagine is a mom and a grand mom, I can only imagine what you and your family have lived through. And so, I thank you for your courage in speaking up.  </p><p>Mr. Kent, I will say to you, privacy is important, and I think probably it is time that we do something on privacy. I have had the Browser Act. I introduced that when I was in the House. It is light touch regulation, but what it does is to give the consumer the opportunity to own as I call it, their virtual you, which is you and your presence online. It gives you control over that and I think this body would be well advised to move forward with legislation, such as that.  </p><p>Mr. Prager, I have been to your website. Know your work and I share your frustration with Google and YouTube, and I know that you filed a lawsuit against both companies in 2017, and I feel for you and sharing your frustration. As you probably know, I have borne the worst of Google's culture--their corporate culture and their employees political bias.  </p><p>And yes indeed Dr. Tripodi, you and I can have a good discussion about this, but they do bring that bias to work and it does inform those algorithms. And one of their Senior Engineers actually singled me out, for my political views and then double down on that. And then Google came along and refused to put up an ad from the Tennessee Republican Party in support of my campaigns. So, is there bias? Yes. Have I experienced firsthand? Yes, I have and--but Mr. Prager, I've got just a couple of questions before we move on and I want to go through these quickly. How did Google and YouTube censorship harm your ability to communicate your message online? </p><p>PRAGER: Well, it's--it's fairly evident. If--if things cannot be seen by any family that restricts pornography and violence, if no school can see it by definition, if it's on the restricted list, if no library can show it,  that--that's a very serious restriction. Especially given that our target audience is young people, so they're depriving us of the--of the very people that we most want to touch with our message. So, that's pretty dramatic.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: And so, how did your viewership go down, after they restricted you? </p><p>PRAGER: Well, I can't give you a number, obviously. There's no way of knowing what number of people are in homes that have already--already have filters and don't even therefore know about a video because it just can't be--accessed. We know that many teachers try to show our videos in classes, and they come up--they can do it on their own, but they can't do it through the school.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: What explanation has Google given you for the restrictions? </p><p>PRAGER: That's--well, you--you used the great word, frustration.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>We have gotten none--and actually it's almost unbelievable. Because if you look at the list, and--and like the 10 Commandments being a perfect example of--of how people will go you have got to be kidding. Well, I finally found out today, you did. We all heard. The Representative of Google told us why the 10 Commandments video was taken down. Because it contains murder.  </p><p>So, as I said we have a solution. We'll put up one without thou shall not murder in it, but it--it--it is--that's so absurd as to be hilarious. This is--this will be something I will replay on my radio show for years. It--it--it--it's--that is the level of absurdity. I feel like I'm in a Monty Python skit here, when--when he says something like that. They're--the--the only possible explanation for all of this is they don't like Prager U, because we're a very, very influential conservative voice touching a lot of lives. There is no other explanation.  </p><p>BLACKBURN: I thank you all. My time's expired but thank you for your attention to the issue. </p><p>PRAGER: Thank you. </p><p>BLACKBURN: And Mr. Chairman, thank you for the focus on--on this. I yield my time.  </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Senator Hirono. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and--and Mr. Parker, of course you have all of our sympathies and empathies for all that you've been going through. You did hear the Google witness say that they are proactively eliminating that--the--this kind of content and you said though that--I think you testified that they're doing nothing. They've done nothing.  </p><p>PARKER: That's--yes. And--and that is correct and--and his testimony was not accurate at all. They are not doing anything. They continue to--well, you heard a lot of responses from--from him today that tap danced around your questions. It's similar to what I've experienced over the last 2 1/2 years.  </p><p>HIRONO: So, Mr. Parker, then is it still all on you, basically. And--and--and you have hired someone to help you. Because it's an engineer to help who specializes in AI, to help track down copies of the video. </p><p>PARKER: Well, I haven't hi--I've gotten thankfully volunteers. There's a gentleman here that's an engineer Eric Feinberg (SP) whose flagged a lot of these videos. Lenny Posner, again, has--and his--and his group have flagged videos, but essentially yeah. The--the onus is still on me. And--and the--the people that--and the volunteers to--to take this stuff down.  </p><p>HIRONO: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>PARKER: And when they do self--and when they do quote on quote \"self-flag something.\" There was one that literally it was flagged to be taken down and then two days--two or three days later it was back up again.  </p><p>HIRONO: I think in--in listening to both your perspective and that of the Google witness, there's obviously not a meeting of the minds and I think--it bears further inquiry on it though. At least on my part. I understand that the TV station that was involved has--has given you the copyright to the video. </p><p>PARKER: Yes.  </p><p>HIRONO: In order to assist efforts. So, why was it necessary for you to resort to claiming copyright infringement. Don't the YouTube community guidelines already prohibit violent or graphic content? </p><p>PARKER: They do, but that was a--a--another avenue for us to say, well, wait a minute. If you're not going to remove violent content and--and moment of death. That was--you know they have a certificate that you apply to these videos that say--says. If you apply the moment of death video or certificate, then we take it down. Except that they don't. They--it's--it's--what they've done is purely ad hoc, arbitrary, random, there's no rhyme or reason to it. So, that was one avenue to turn. You know, if--if we can get them to--to flag content. Then we'll you know we'll go after them from copyright infringement. We own the digital rights to this, and they ignore that too. Again, because they can.  </p><p>HIRONO: So, the--the basis of this hearing is that--that the of the Chairman is trying to show that these platforms set--figure out a way to--to seek out conservative content. That is not your question. </p><p>PARKER: That is not my issue. </p><p>HIRONO: That is not your issue at all.  </p><p>PARKER: Right. And I think it's--it's a much more--I mean, not that this isn't important--your issue is it important, but you know the fact that they're showing murder and execution on--on you know on the web. You know, section 230 was--my understanding is that--that it had been addressed, but with--with child photography and there was some legislation on that. And I think if we can take--I would implore this committee and--and Congress to take--at least address a narrow issue with this. Similar to that--to that precedent and--and say, you can't show this stuff. </p><p>HIRONO: So, are--are you suggesting that section 230. They make exceptions to the Immunity from Liability be expanded. </p><p>PARKER: Yes. </p><p>HIRONO: Possibly that we should? </p><p>PARKER: Absolutely. </p><p>HIRONO: Sure. </p><p>PARKER: Yes. </p><p>HIRONO: I agree with that. So, for Dr. Tripodi. I think you know it's very clear that from the examples you gave that the inquiry that what--that you put in can come up with totally different results. So, I--I have to say that when--that when we're told that when search results are biased but the results are not biased. It's--it what--what you're asking. That results and the and they--they--whatever information you get. So, there's a lot of stuff on all these platforms and this past summer, President Trump tweeted that Google raise its search results in favor of supposedly liver--liberal. I'm sorry. In favor of liberal news outlets, but you testified that the results depend on what inquiry you put in. So, you can put in a totally innocuous kind of result and get a lot of what would be called conservative content. So, based on your research, does Google really good its search results against conservatives?  </p><p>TRIPODI: So, based on my research. I don't look specifically at rigging within my research, but I look at how algorithms are working. And so, algorithms are a product of both the input plus the output and for me and what my research demonstrates is that the input, which is largely driven by the user does determine the kind of output that you're going to receive. </p><p>HIRONO: Yeah. So, I think that's why--to show that there--there's--there's an actual bias in--in how they do a moderate the content to issues it's not so easy. Not to mention that I think I should--you know I--I showed in the draft--graph rather. The chart that I showed that actually there seems to be a lot more content that put in the restrictive mode. Not of Prager U, but of these other entities that are deemed a lot more liberal. So, I'm really not understanding Mr. Prager's concerns.  </p><p>Before I end Mr. Chairman, I would like to get unanimous consent to enter the following into the record. A report titled Searching for Alternative Facts Analyzing's Scriptural internal--Inference and Conservative News Practices, writ--written by Dr. Tripodi.  </p><p>CRUZ: (OFF-MIC) Without object--without objection.  </p><p>HIRONO: An article entitled No big tet is--Big Tech, sorry, Isn't Silencing Conservatism. Also written by Dr. Tripodi. </p><p>CRUZ: Without objection.  </p><p>HIRONO: And I ask for unanimous consent to enter the following statements into the record. The statement of Steve DelBianco of NetChoice. </p><p>CRUZ: All--all of the statements--will be entered. </p><p>HIRONO: Okay. Thank you. And the statement Baron Soca of Tech Freedom and the statement of--Caleb Watney of R Street, and then, finally, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record an editorial that ran in the Washington Post on July 13th, titled How Congress Can Destroy Social Media.  </p><p>CRUZ: All of those will be entered into the record.  </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, to each of the witnesses. Mr. Parker, I want to thank you again for--for sharing your story and your daughter story and--and I will say I very much agree with you, that you ought to be able to sue the heck out of Google and YouTube.  </p><p>PARKER: Yep.  </p><p>CRUZ: And if anybody else, other than Big Tech, did what they have done to you. If any other citizen delivered a VHS tape of the murder of her daughter to you and your neighbors, you would have a common-law torque for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and you could recover very significant damages. There is one group in the United States that is allowed to do what it's doing to you and that is Big Tech because Congress has given them a special subsidy. An immunity from liability, so they don't bear the consequences of their actions. And I think this hearing has underscored the need for Congress to revisit that.  </p><p>PARKER: And I hope you will do so, sir. </p><p>CRUZ: As do I. Mr. Prager, you described YouTube restricting various videos. I guess a total of I believe it is 56 videos produced by Prager University on topics like the 10 Commandments. Another topic, as I understand it, that was restricted was one in which noted Liberal Professor Alan Dershowitz, who was a professor of mine in law school, did a video for you historical account of Israel's founding and--and as I understand it, YouTube restricted that video as well. Does YouTube ever explained why it is restricting these--videos?  </p><p>PRAGER: (OFF-MIC) It explains nothing.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>It explains nothing. This was the first explanation I heard. The incorporation of murder into the 10 Commandments. With regard to Professor-- </p><p>CRUZ: You would think that we would want young people-- </p><p>PRAGER: We--we would. We would.  </p><p>CRUZ: Hearing thou shall not murder. </p><p>PRAGER: I have to admit. </p><p>CRUZ: That seems like a really good-- </p><p>PRAGER: It was an argument for the alternative universe at that moment for me. I had never accepted the possibility of one, but I agree with you, that is exactly what young people should here. Murd--God doesn't want you to murder, but so be it.  </p><p>As regard to Professor Dershowitz and the video on Israel's founding, we--we have 320 videos, 15 of them concern Israel and half of them have at one time or another been restricted. There is clearly a--a loathing of Israel at Google. I--I suspect there is a loathing of America as well. Virtually every video that we have put out that depicts America in a favorable way. It has also been at some time or another on the restricted list.  </p><p>My favorite example for years, was Viktor Davis Hanson, this remarkable Professor of Classics and he--he made a video. He's one of the calmest speaking humans I have ever met. He is the opposite of--of a grenade throwing speaker and the subject was the Korean War. The Korean War in five minutes and it is no longer on the restricted. They go in and out, apparently in some cases, and that was on the restricted list because--so, I try to think why would that be like?  </p><p>And I--I could only come up with the fact that it shows how noble America's cause in--in core--Korea was. The 37,000 Americans died to keep half of the Korean Peninsula free. How many people even know that. The Korean War is--is--is--is it--is--is in the--the rubbish bin of history so as London used to put it. It's--it's just unknown. So, we want people to be proud of America, not proud of its evils. Of course, America's had evils because it's composed of people and people do evil. But it's largely been extraordinarily good, and they don't want us to depict that. </p><p>CRUZ: And--and Mr. Prager, could you describe what the effect is when a video is placed on the restricted list? We heard the representative from Google say, oh, it's no big deal. It just 2 percent, you should be just fine with it. What is--what is the effect of Google arbitrarily placing videos (INAUDIBLE--) </p><p>PRAGER: Well, as I explained earlier it can't--it can't be seen by--vast numbers of parents have filters. Totally understandably given how much junk is on the--on the--on the Internet. So, we're--we're--this is what so--very important. It not only hurts us in that that family can't see that video. It hurts us because then it is a statement by Google that Prager University produces videos on the moral level of pornography. I mean, that's a--that's a-- </p><p>CRUZ: And there's no appeal. There's no remedy when-- </p><p>PRAGER: No, there is none. </p><p>CRUZ: The (INAUDIBLE) exercises arbitrary power-- </p><p>PRAGER: We have actually spoken to representatives of theirs that after they say algorithm if we actually get someone on the phone. We--we have had humans review it at Google and keep it up. Why? That's a--a community standards. Your video violated community standards. Well, how exactly does the founding of Israel by a Harvard Law Professor, violate community standards? It just does.  </p><p>CRUZ: You know, I have to say it reminds me of the--the famous adage about the Supreme Court. We are not infallible because we are final, but rather we--we--we are--we are not final because we're infallible, but rather we're infallible because we are final. And--and that--that appears to be the same approach at Google.  </p><p>Dr. Epstein, I found your testimony incredibly powerful and incredibly concerning and--and if anyone draws new out of this hearing. I would encourage you to review very carefully, Dr. Epstein's testimony and I'd like to take a moment to make clear several things. First of all, as--as I understand your background. You're not a Republican and--and nor are you a conservative. Is that accurate? </p><p>EPSTEIN: That would be an understatement. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CRUZ: And indeed, you're the Former Editor in Chief of Psychology today.  </p><p>EPSTEIN: Correct.  </p><p>CRUZ: So, you are a respected academic. You testified before this committee, that Google's manipulation of votes gave at least 2.6 million additional votes to Hillary Clinton in the year 2016. Is that correct? </p><p>EPSTEIN: That's correct.  </p><p>CRUZ: And--and--and I want to make sure I understand. You personally supported and voted for Hillary Clinton.  </p><p>EPSTEIN: I was a very strong public supporter of Hillary Clinton. Yes. </p><p>CRUZ: So, you're not dis--dismayed that people voted for her, but your testimony is that Google is through bias in search results, manipulating voters in a way they're not aware of. </p><p>EPSTEIN: On a massive scale. And what I'm saying is that I believe in democracy. I believe in the free and fair election, more than I have any kind of allegiance to a candidate or party. </p><p>CRUZ: And--and looking forward, if I understood--stood your testimony correctly. You said in subsequent elections Google, and Facebook, and Twitter, and  Big Techs manipulation could manipulate as many as 15 million votes in a subsequent election. </p><p>EPSTEIN: In 2020, if all of these companies are supporting the same candidate, there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace. </p><p>CRUZ: Now--now, you describe the Go Vote reminder and you said it wasn't a public service announcement, but rather manipulation. Can explain how? --I'm not sure everyone followed the details of that.  </p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, sure. If on election day in 2016. If Mark Zuckerberg, for example, had chosen to send out a Go Vote Reminder. Say just to Democrats, and no one would've known if he had done this, that would have given that day an additional at least 450,000 votes to Democrats and we know this without doubt because of Facebook's own published data. Because they did an experiment that they didn't tell anyone about during the 2010 election. They published it in 2012. It had 60 million Facebook users involved. They sent out a Go Vote Reminder and they got something like 360,000 more people to get off their sofas and go vote, who otherwise would have stayed home.  </p><p>The point is I don't think that Mr. Zuckerberg sent out that reminder in 2016. I think he was overconfident. I think Google--Google was overconfident, all these companies were. I don't think he sent that out. Without monitoring systems in place, we'll never know what these companies are doing.  </p><p>But the point is in 2018, I'm sure they were more aggressive. We have lots of data to support that. And in 2020, you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out and the methods that they're using are invisible, their subliminal, their more powerful than most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences and I've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years. </p><p>CRUZ: You know, our Democratic colleagues on this committee often talk about what they view as the pernicious effect of big money and big corporate dollars. What you are testifying to is that a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars collectively. Massively influencing the results of elections and there's no accountability. You said, we don't know. We have no way of knowing if Google or Facebook or Twitter, sends it's--sends its Democrats or Republicans or how they bias it because it's a black box with--with--with--with no transparency or accountability whatsoever. I mean, in my understanding you correctly. </p><p>EPSTEIN: Senator, with respect, I must correct you. </p><p>CRUZ: Please. </p><p>EPSTEIN: If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to send out a Go Vote Reminder just to Democrats on election day. That doesn't cost him a dime.  </p><p>CRUZ: Fair enough. Do you happen to know who the Hillary Clinton Campaign's number one financial supporter was in the year of 2016? </p><p>EPSTEIN: I think I do, but please remind me. </p><p>CRUZ: The number one financial supporter of the Hillary Clinton Campaign in the 2016 election was the parent company of Google Alphabetical. </p><p>EPSTEIN: Oh, yeah.  </p><p>CRUZ: Who was our first witness. They were her number one financial donor and your testimony is through their deceptive search methods. They moved 2.6 million votes in her direction. I would think anybody whether or not you favor one candidate, or another should be deeply dismayed about a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires having that much power over our elections to silently and deceptively shift vote outcomes.  </p><p>EPSTEIN: Again, with respect. I must correct you. The 2.6 million is a rock bottom minimum. The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million, depending on how aggressively they use the techniques that I've been studying over 6 1/2 years.  </p><p>CRUZ: Wow. Could--could you just say that again, please? Just-- </p><p>EPSTEIN: The 2.6 million is a rock bottom minimum. The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes, depending on how aggressive they were in using the techniques that I've been studying. Such as the search engine manipulation affect, the search suggestion affect, the answer bought affect, and a number of others. They control these and no one can counteract them. These are not competitive. These are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.  </p><p>CRUZ: If any head--headline comes out of this hearing, that should be it. Senator Hirono. </p><p>HIRONO: I have just one clarifying question for Dr. Tripodi. So, we've heard from Dr. Epstein and he has published research that substantiates what he says. Although I haven't--there is a question as to whether or not he used all the results that actually he should have used, but are you familiar with--with his methodology? </p><p>TRIPODI: Yes.  </p><p>HIRONO: Do you agree with Dr. Epstein's conclusions.  </p><p>c:  I would say we would come to different conclusions, but I'm not sure because we do not know what the search terms that were used in this study. So, I read at length the testimony as well as the reports that he has submitted and based on what I see, and we can go through it together. But there's a couple of things that draw out to me. One, when they--we run through how the experimental studies were run. It seems that people were given in advance which search terms to study--to--to search and as far as my research demonstrates that different search terms will yield different kinds of results. </p><p>HIRONO: Well, that--that is your--the whole point of what your testimony is from what I gather. You can get all kinds of results based on what your inquiry is and if people actually got to the--if they were told what's--what in--inquiry to put in, I think you are going to get different kind of results. </p><p>TRIPODI: And Senator, excuse me just for a second. These are very simple shifts in syntax that have very different ideological bases, so something like gun rights versus gun-control have different ideological positions encoded into them.  </p><p>EPSTEIN: Senator, may I reply brief--briefly?  </p><p>HIRONO : (OFF-MIC)  </p><p>EPSTEIN: Yes. Well, we're aware of that. So, obviously, we started with more than 500 terms. We narrowed it down to 250 and we had those rated by independent raters. We only use search terms that were not biased in one direction or another. And again, that's based on ratings by independent readers. We are--we're--acutely aware of these kinds of issues and we control for them. </p><p>HIRONO: Are you going to possibly undertake a study of how Russia's interference with our election's. What kind of impact that had? Are you embarking on that study?  </p><p>EPSTEIN: We've looked into that, Senator. I'm very interested in it. I think it's reprehensible that this kinds of thing--this kind of thing happens, but in fact Russia was using several techniques, but mainly targeted ads and the problem there is there now in a world--in an environment that's highly, highly, highly competitive. People also can see ads, so they can you know use their judgment and have confirmation bias plays a role in how they react to abs and-- </p><p>HIRONO: (OFF-MIC) --study you did that--that you talked about probably has all those kinds of factors as--as being--complicating the picture. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRUZ: Dr. Epstein, Senator Hirono questioned your methodology and--and--and also said that all there were similar problems with search results as there are with ads. I--I want to give you a full opportunity simply to--to respond to those criticisms and--and explain the methodology you used.  </p><p>EPSTEIN: Well sure. Ads and fake news stories for that matter, they are visible and they're competitive. So, there have always been those kinds of manipulations that go back hundred years. There have always been fake ads. There have always been fake news stories and they are competitive.  </p><p>That's a competitive environment. You put your--your billboard, I put up my billboard. The problem with the techniques that I've been discovering, and quantifying is that they are brand-new. The Internet has made them possible. They've never been possible before in human history and they're controlled entirely and exclusively by Google and to a lesser extent Facebook.  </p><p>Their brand-new. I had--I've had to put names on them one by one, as I've discovered them because they're so bizarre. One quick example, we've shown in our experiments, that just by manipulating search suggestions those phrases that are flashed at you when you're typing in a search term. We can turn a 50-50 split among undecided voters into a 90-10 split, with no one having the slightest idea that they have been manipulated.  </p><p>We have reason to believe-- </p><p>CRUZ: Can you--can you put some specificity on that? I don't know if that example can be flushed out, but.  </p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, yes, in fact, we did that using the names of presidential candidates and we flashed search suggestions as people were typing letters. And we deliberately withheld negative search suggestions from some of our participants and with other participants now and then we allowed a negative to show up on the list. Well, when you show a negative on the list and right now, if you look up Donald Trump is, you will find one negative. When you put a negative on the list, that draws 10 to 15 times as many clicks as neutral or positive terms.  </p><p>So, if your algorithm suppresses negative search terms--search suggestions I should say, for one candidate, as we know will did for Hillary Clinton, my candidate, in 2016. But you allow negatives to appear now and then for the opposing candidate. Those negative search suggestions draw a tremendous amount of traffic to websites that show that candidate in a negative light. And what I'm telling you is we have shown that using this technique, we can turn a 50-50 split among undecided voters into a 90-10 split with no one having the slightest idea they have been manipulated. We have reason to believe that Google is knowingly, deliberately, strategically manipulating people's thinking and behavior from the very first character people type into the search box.  </p><p>CRUZ: And--and Dr. Epstein, can--can you elaborate? You said, we have reason to believe that Google is doing this knowingly and deliberately. Can--can you explain why--why we have reason to believe that?  </p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, pull out your cell phones. If you--if you type the letter A into Google search box. By the way, you should never, ever use Google.com. Never because it tracks you.  </p><p>You should use either something like DuckDuckGo or my favorite is called Startpage. Startpage.com, which has full access to Google's index. But the point is, if you type the letter A into the search box, depending on your relationship with Google and how much they know about you. There's a very good chance that you're going to see Amazon listed in the first position, second position, third position, maybe all three positions.  </p><p>Guess what. Amazon is Google's largest advertiser and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other company. These are business partners and Google is trying to send you to Amazon when you type the letter A. Type in the G.  </p><p>CRUZ: And for what it's worth, I just typed A. I got Amazon, Area 51 raid-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And Amazon prime. So, those are the three Google suggestions, two of which are Amazon.  </p><p>EPSTEIN: Wow. That's--that's actually something because I'm assuming you don't block them in any--anyway. So, they know all about you and they're still trying to send you to Amazon and Amazon prime. But type in the G and you'll get something different. If you type in the G, there's a good chance you're going to get a list of Google products. They're trying to send you to Google and the lesson here for all of us is, if you start a company make sure the name of it does not begin with the G. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you very much. Thank you, to each of you for a very illuminating testimony and I appreciate your being here. I want to thank all the witnesses who testified before the subcommittee. We will be keeping the hearing record open for additional two weeks, which means the record will be close at the end of the business day on Tuesday, July 30, 2019. Senators may submit follow-up questions to witnesses by that date and--and if there are follow-up questions. The witnesses are asked to respond as soon as possible and--in writing. And with that this hearing was not sponsored by the letter G. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And this hearing is adjourned. </p><p>(GAVEL) </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM2-66C1-F15W-H199-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CALIF.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]CRUZ: This hearing is called to order. Welcome. Free speech is foundational to our Constitution. The First Amendment and the Bill of Rights begins by protecting our rights to free speech and our democratic processes depend upon robust free speech, speech with which we agree and speech with which we disagree. The marketplace of ideas. </p><p>Since the beginning of journalism, there has been bias in the media. From the first journalist carving on stone tablets, media bias and bias of human beings has been a fact of life. But today we face an altogether different threads. The power of big tech is something that William Randolph Hearst at the height of yellow journalism could not have imagined. </p><p>In particular what makes the threat of political censorship so problematic is the lack of transparency, the invisibility. The ability for a handful of giant tech companies to decide if a particular speaker is disfavored, that he or she may speak and their words simply fade into the ether, that no one hears what they say and nobody knows that no one hears what they say. Not only does big tech have the power to silence voices with wh--with which they disagree but big tech likewise has the power to collate a person's feed so that they only receive the news that comports with their own political agenda. </p><p>Polling shows roughly 70 percent of Americans receive their political news from social media. That power is enormous and I will tell you in traveling the state of Texas and traveling the country over and over again I've heard from Americans concerned about a consistent pattern of political bias and censorship on the part of big tech. </p><p>Big tech enjoys a special immunity from liability under what's called Section 230 the Communications Decency Act. Now a great many people agree that the pattern, the anti-conservative bias and the pattern of censorship we are seeing from the tech is concerning. The question of remedy is a more complicated one. </p><p>What to do about it is a thorny question. It's a thorny legal question, it's a thorny policy question. Nobody or at least nobody in their right mind wants to see a government speech police. No one wants to see the federal government regulating what is allowed to be said. But there are at least three potential remedies that can be considered either by Congress or the administration or both. </p><p>The first I mentioned is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that provides a special immunity from liability that big tech enjoys that nobody else gets. The predicate for that immunity from liability is that the social media platforms were understood to be neutral public forum. In other words, they were simply posting what others said; they weren't engaging in their own political advocacy. </p><p>And I will note some commentators have misunderstood the argument I am making with this in that they suggested that I'm arguing that Section 230 requires in its statutory text that big tech companies be neutral public forum. That's not my argument. </p><p>My argument is that big tech made effectively a bargain with Congress and a bargain with the American people; we will be neutral, we will be there, we won't be biased in exchange for that we will receive what is effectively a federal subsidy of immunity for liability. If big tech wants to be partisan political speakers it has that right but it has no entitlement to a special immunity from liability under Section 230 that the New York Times doesn't enjoy, that the Washington Post doesn't enjoy, that nobody else enjoys other than big tech. </p><p>The second potential avenue for remedy is the antitrust laws, applying the antitrust laws in this area is complicated but by almost any measure the giant tech companies today are larger and more powerful than standard oil was when it was broken up. They are larger and more powerful than AT&amp;T was when it was broken up. And if we have tech companies using the powers of monopoly to censor political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues. </p><p>The third potential avenue of remedy is under principles of fraud. Most users of Facebook, Twitter, Google when they use those services, they don't envision that they are participating in a biased forum. They believe that when they speak the people who have chosen to follow them will hear what they say and there are distressing pieces of evidence that suggest that is not the case. </p><p>Now I will note much of the argument in this topic is anecdotal. It's based on one example or another example. There is a reason for that because we have no data. There is no transparency. Nobody knows how many speakers Twitter is blocking, how many speakers Facebook is blocking. Nobody knows what the raw data is in terms of bias. </p><p>So one of the first things that this hearing seeks to accomplish is simply move us towards transparency to understand what the facts are. Argument by antidote is less than satisfying but it is all that we are left with as long as big tech remains a black box that simply says trust us. </p><p>Senator Hirono? </p><p>HIRONO: I join the chairman in welcoming our witnesses this afternoon. There are many areas where the Senate should be conducting oversight of the tech industry; baseless allegations of anti-conservative bias is not one of them. </p><p>We still need a full accounting of the ways that Russia used Facebook and other forms of social media to influence the 2016 election. YouTube is full of misleading and outright false information about vaccines that has put the public at risk. The alt right continues to use Twitter to organize and spread hate. </p><p>Each of the companies that will be testifying here this morning failed to continue contain the spread of the video of the mosque shootings in New Zealand, videos that can still be found on these platforms. These are just a few of the real and serious issues we could investigate about the tech industry. Yet here we are discussing claims of anti-conservative bias that have been disproven time and again. One of our witnesses, Professor Francesca Tripodi studies partisanship on social media and finds that conservative perspectives abound on Facebook, Google, and Twitter. </p><p>She describes claims of anti-conservative bias as nothing more than a mix of anecdotal evidence which the chairman has acknowledged and a failure to understand the companies' algorithms and content moderation practices. Professor Tripodi's conclusions are consistent with those of media watchdog Media Matters and others that anti-conservative bias simply does not exist. </p><p>So why are we here? If anti-conservative bias by the tech industry has been proven false why in the world are we holding a hearing on it in the United States Senate? The answer is simple. People, it's politics. For decades Republicans have bashed the supposedly liberal mainstream media in an effort to work the reps and gain more favorable coverage and the strategy has worked. </p><p>Research shows that major news outlets have overcompensated for their perceived liberal bias by treating Democrats more harshly than Republicans. For example, the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy found that Hillary Clinton received a larger share of negative news coverage over the course of the 2016 election than Donald--Donald Trump did. Now that two-thirds of Americans get their news from social media Republicans have a new bogeyman to target, big tech. And just like traditional media--media, tech companies have responded to false claims of bias by trying to placate the right. </p><p>In June 2016 Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, went to the conservative American Enterprise Institute to announce that Facebook would offer political bias training to its employees. Over the past two years, Facebook and Twitter have dispatched emissaries to meet with Republican leaders and conservative commentators behind closed doors. Last summer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey seemingly apologized in response to baseless claims that Twitter engaged in so-called shadow banning of conservatives tweeting we have a lot more work to do to earn people's trust on how we work. </p><p>We simply cannot allow the Republican Party to harass tech companies into weakening content moder--moderation policies that already--that already failed to remove hateful, dangerous and misleading content. </p><p>Anyone who frequents social media knows that the online world can be a pretty vile place. Unfortunately few people know this better than another one of our witnesses, Robbie Parker. Robbie is the father of Emily Parker, one of the 20 children and six adults murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012. </p><p>After suffering through this terrible tragedy Robbie and his family have spent the past 6+ years dealing with online harassment from conspiracy theorists who claim the shooting was a hoax. Think about that. Robbie had his daughter tragically taken from him. While he struggled to cope with that loss, he had to deal with people telling him that his daughter didn't die, that he was a crisis actor paid to stage a shooting as a way for the government to confiscate people's guns. To this day if you Google Robbie's name you are presented with links to conspiracy sites. </p><p>And just yesterday I Googled Robbie Parker and this is what I got back. Two of the three videos claim that Sandy Hook was a hoax in the very first webpage returned is called quote if Sandy Hook was not a hoax how do you explain the Robbie Parker video end quote. This is over six years since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and these lies are still being featured by Google. </p><p>I had hoped to discuss this and other concerns I have with Google during today's hearing. Unfortunately, the chairman rejected Google's proposed witness and wouldn't even let him attend at my invitation. So there is an empty seat over there at the witness table. </p><p>This is important because Robbie is an example of the real world harm that comes with content posted on the Internet. He is an example of why strong content moderation is necessary. </p><p>Now I understand that some conservatives have had content remove based on Facebook's, Google's and Twitter's content moderation policies but let's be clear it's not because they are conservative. After all Google and Facebook are two of the biggest and most profitable companies on the planet acknowledged by the chair, too. They did not reach this level of success by turning away a portion of their potential customers. </p><p>If conservatives have had their content removed maybe they should look at the content, at the content that they are posting. Maybe they shouldn't post lies about Planned Parenthood selling baby body parts. Maybe they shouldn't inflame religious tensions by misrepresenting the tenants of one of the world's major religions or maybe they shouldn't use their platform to harass and spread lies about a dad who lost his little girl in the most tragic way possible. </p><p>I hope that going forward this subcommittee will focus on the real issues facing America like hate speech, like voter suppression, like looking into the emoluments clause. That's what I'd like this committee to pursue, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Senator Hirono. And now to address the question of whether or not bias and censorship exist we have a member of this committee who indeed has faced it firsthand, Senator Blackburn. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I think it is fair to say I have had a couple of brushes with social media companies in the past couple of years. And I will also say it is indeed a pleasure and an honor to live in a country that values free speech. </p><p>We see this as a cherished constitutional right. In authoritarian countries like Russia or China there is no such thing as free speech and if you were to voice any form of dissent or criticism then surprise, a Communist Party official shows up on your doorstep and they take you to prison. Fortunately, we live in America. </p><p>I will tell you that I do think it's time for tech companies like Google and Facebook to start embracing the spirit of the First Amendment, not just for their own employees but for all of the Americans who use their platforms. What value is there in platforms that are more concerned with inserting their bias than providing a neutral place for people to discuss their ideas? </p><p>Companies like Facebook and Google which have transformed society in revolutionary ways need to recognize that with that power comes great responsibility. Facebook is a corporation, not a state actor. Yet Facebook runs a forum for debate like the town public square except there is no mayor or sheriff that would be allowed to police conversation the way that Facebook sensors conversation online. </p><p>Last June I published an op-ed urging Silicon Valley companies to respect a diversity of opinions and to address allegations of conservative bias on their platforms. If they truly were impartial actors encountering a series of unfortunate events, lay their case out for the American public; lay out your case. My suggestions really didn't go over very well in the Silicon Valley. Little has changed since then. </p><p>Earlier this month Google bent the knee to employee demands to shut down its external AI Ethics Board because heaven forbid a woman serving on the committee was the president of a respected conservative think tank. For these employees in Silicon Valley, conservative credentials are absolutely a scarlet letter. </p><p>Unfortunately, Facebook is no different. By one count Facebook had nearly 2 dozen scandals over privacy violations in 2018 alone. At some point, Facebook will have to atone for these sins. Clearly, GDPR isn't causing the company much pain. If anything it appears to have solidified their dominance in the marketplace while increasing barriers to entry for potential competitors. </p><p>I think we should be clear that at least here in the United States Senate Mark Zuckerberg's pivot to privacy isn't fooling anybody. This sudden support for European-style privacy protections is disingenuous by allowing the Europeans to force their hand when it comes to addressing content including political speech Facebook can cloak itself in altruistic cloth while conveniently elevating any constitutional arguments back at home. In order to arrive at consensus on privacy, data security and net neutrality issues we are maintaining a bipartisan posture both on the Commerce and Judiciary committees. </p><p>This week Senator Klobuchar and I sent a letter to the FTC urging stronger action for bad actors in the tech sector. Americans are rightly concerned about who owns their virtual you. They want to be certain that their privacy is protected, both in the physical and the virtual space. The FTC has a responsibility to hold tech companies accountable for securing their platforms. Big tech is accustomed to living in a bubble with the same comfortable and progressive ideas. </p><p>But let me tell you right now that bubble is bursting. When I voice my concerns about infringements on our freedom of speech a senior Google search engineer called me a terrorist. I was a congressman when I voiced my concerns in 2018 and I sit before you now as a senator and a member of this panel. No matter what I will continue to protect the right of Americans to engage in free speech, even speech I disagree with. I wish big tech would show the same respect. </p><p>Whether Californians like it or not they are going to need to work with us and negotiate with us to see how we can bring meaningful privacy reforms to the people of the United States of America. I yield back. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Senator Blackburn. I will now introduce each of the two witnesses on our first panel. </p><p>The first witness is Carl--Carlos Monje Jr. who is Twitter's director of policy and philanthropy for the United States and Canada. Before joining Twitter Mr. Monje spent over a decade in public service including multiple senior-level positions in the Obama administration. </p><p>From 2014 through 2016 he served in the U.S. Department of Transportation rising to acting undersecretary and assistant secretary for transportation policy where he oversaw the implementation of surface transportation programs. Prior to joining the Department of Transportation Mr. Monje served for three years in the White House Domestic Policy Council where he oversaw all aspects of policy, message and event development across a wide spectrum of domestic policy issues. Mr. Monje is from New Orleans, a first-generation American and a graduate of Harvard College. </p><p>The second witness is Neil Potts. Neil Potts is the public policy director at Facebook where he currently leads the content policy and strategic response teams. He oversees the development and implementation of Facebook's community standards, the rules for what types of content are allowed on the platform. </p><p>Mr. Potts previously spent a decade in Washington, D.C. as a public policy and legislative affairs attorney including five years at the Truman National Security Project. He is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps having served five years as an intelligence officer after graduating with a degree in mathematics from the United States Naval Academy. He is a graduate at University of Virginia School of Law. </p><p>Welcome to you both. I would ask that you stand, raise your white--right hand and be sworn in. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? </p><p>Mr. Monje, you may go first. </p><p>MONJE: Thank you, sir. Chairman Cruz, Ranking Member Hirono, members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to appear today. Twitter is an American company and Twitter's purpose is to serve the public conversation. We welcome perspectives and insights from diverse sources and embrace being a platform where the open and free exchange of ideas can occur. </p><p>We put the people who use our service first in every step we take. We have rules in place that are designed to ensure the safety and security of the people who come to our service. Safety and free expression go hand in hand, both online and in the real world. If people don't feel safe to speak, they very often won't. </p><p>These two guideposts, free expression for all perspectives and rules of the road to promote safety are not only in our users' interest but also paramount to sustaining our business. Let me be clear about an important and foundational fact. Twitter does not use political viewpoints, perspectives or party affiliation to make any decisions with are related to automatically ranking content or how we enforce our rules. </p><p>Every day elected representatives use Twitter to communicate with their constituents, with their peers and international counterparts. In the United States, every single senator, governor and House member has a Twitter account. Millions of people around the globe take to Twitter to engage in conversations on a wide range of issues. The notion that we would silence any political perspective is antithetical to our commitment to free expression. </p><p>There has never been a time in history when individuals have had more tools to reach a broad audience. And Twitter continues to be one of the most popular platforms for conservative voices. In preparation for this hearing and to better inform the members of the subcommittee our data scientist analyze tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate for a five-week period from February to March of this year. </p><p>After controlling for factors like number of followers we observed that there is no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed versus a tweet by a Republican. Their performance is the same because the Twitter platform does not take sides. </p><p>Let me address a few high-profile issues that have led some to question our impartiality. In July of last year, we acknowledged that some accounts including those of Republicans and Democrats were not being auto-suggested when people were searching for a specific name. This means that you had to hit enter before seeing them in the search results. This issue impacted 600,000 accounts across the globe, the vast majority of which were not political and however, 10 accounts of Republican members of Congress were affected. </p><p>The auto-suggest issue happened because twitter had tweaked a behavioral-based algorithm designed to reduce abuse. Specifically, we were down-ranking content if a significant number of an account's followers had histories of breaking our rules. Once we identified this issue, we probably resolved it within 24 hours and it is important to note that because Twitter is so transparent follower accounts of those members of Congress spiked following the publicity on the issue. </p><p>I would like to discuss another recent issue the account @unplannedmovie. This account was caught in our automated systems used to detect ban evasion. Ban evasion technology is an important tool to reduce the number of repeat offenders on our platform. Specifically, the person who created the movie's account was previously suspended for breaking our rules. We reinstated @unplannedmovie as soon as it was brought to our attention that the account was not being used for similar violative activity and the hashtag unplannedmovie became a trending topic on Twitter. </p><p>Many other accusations of bias stem from issues about how our platform organizes information and often very serious violations of our terms of service which are not always visible to the public. I explain these in greater detail in my written testimony. </p><p>Every day we see hundreds of millions of tweets and thousands of violations of our policies. We try to get each one of those right but we do make mistakes on all sides of the political spectrum and all around the world. We will consistently work to get better and to be more transparent about our efforts. </p><p>Senator Blackburn, we apologized to your Senate office and to the campaign but on behalf of Twitter, I apologize again. We made the wrong call. We develop policies governing advertisements that run on Twitter to try to balance allowing our advertisers to promote messages with protecting individuals who did not ask to see that ad. I am sorry. </p><p>Twitter wouldn't be Twitter if everyone had the same viewpoint. We strive to balance safety and freedom of expression every day. We believe strongly in being impartial and we endeavor to enforce our rules dispassionately. We work extremely hard to make sure our algorithms are fair and aim to be transparent and fix issues when we make mistakes in order to maintain the trust of our users, advertisers and the general public. </p><p>Thank you and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Mr. Potts? </p><p>POTTS: Thank you, chairman. Chairman Cruz, Ranking Member Hirono and distinguished members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. </p><p>My name is Neil Potts and I am a Director at Facebook with oversight of our community standards. Those are the rules which allow what types of content we have on the platform. I am a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and the University of Virg--Virginia School of Law. Prior to joining Facebook, I served as a ground intelligence officer in the United States Marine Corps where I was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. </p><p>Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and to bring the world closer together. More than 2 billion people come to our platform every month to connect with family, to connect with friends, to find out what is going on in their world, to build their businesses, to volunteer or donate to organizations they care about and to help those in need. </p><p>Our users share billions of pictures, stories, and videos about their lives and their beliefs every single day. It is this diversity of viewpoints and expression of experiences that highlights much of what is good about Facebook. But can also mean that it is tough to make decisions about what should be and should not be allowed in the platform. </p><p>I would like to make one point clear. Facebook does not favor one political viewpoint over another and we do not suppress conservative speech. We are committed to encouraging dialogue and the free flow of ideas by designing our products to give people a voice by implementing standards and to ensure fair and transparent processes for removing content that does not belong on Facebook. </p><p>We created our community standards to standardize our content removal decisions so they can be applied consistently, fairly, neutrally to a community that transcends regions, cultures, religions and languages. And we take that neutrality seriously. Our artificial intelligence algorithms have been designed and our human content reviewers have been trained to ensure that content is reviewed in a neutral unbiased way. And we are really focused on what is needed to keep our users safe. </p><p>Our community standards should not prohibit users from discussing controversial topics or supporting a debated point of view nor do they favor opinions on one end of the political spectrum or another. Given the vast amount of content we have on our platform, our reviewers have to respond to millions of reports each week from people all over the world. </p><p>We don't always get it right. We know there have been a number of high-profile content removal incidents and we are taking several steps to respond to those concerns raised by the subcommittee and others. </p><p>First, we publish a Community Standards Enforcement Report twice a year. That report describes the amount and types of content we have taken action against. We publish comprehensive guidelines to provide more clarity around content moderation decisions. </p><p>Second, we have solicited external feedback on our content moderation policies and sources across the political spectrum. For example, former Senator Kyl, he is leading a team gathering insights from members of Congress, a number of conservative groups assessing whether there are any ways in which the company is unintentionally biased against conservative points of view. </p><p>Another example is Laura Murphy. She is a national civil liberties and civil rights leader who is guide an independent civil rights audit of our platform. Third, we have created an appeals process for content that has been removed from our platform as hate speech. We are working to extend that process further by creating an independent Oversight Board of experts for on free speech and safety to render binding and transparent decisions on these appeals. </p><p>Fourth, we have partnered with over 100 groups across the political spectrum. We are continuing to expand that list of outside partner organizations to ensure we receive feedback on our content policies from a diverse set of viewpoints. And finally, we are continuing our work to refine and enhance the quality of our machine learning. The machine learning which is our first line of defense (INAUDIBLE) content assessment on our platform. </p><p>We hope that these improvements and safeguards will help ensure that Facebook remains a platform that enables the broadest spectrum of free expression possible while still keeping our space welcoming and safe for the entire community. There is a lot more to do but we are proud the significant progress we have made over the last few years. Still, we know that people have questions and I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you to both of the witnesses and I will note also for the record that originally there was planned to be a third witness from Google as the ranking member observed. However, Google declined to provide a witness of comparable seniority and responsibility in the company as the other two witnesses here. And so accordingly this committee will be conducting a separate and subsequent hearing focused directly on Google and the issues of Google's censorship of speech. </p><p>Gentlemen, let me--let me start with a question that I have asked both of your companies more than once which is a--a simple and straightforward question that I would like to get a simple and straightforward answer to which is and let's start with you, Mr. Monje. Does Twitter consider itself a neutral public forum? </p><p>MONJE: Twitter strives every day to be an impartial platform where all voices can come and speak. </p><p>CRUZ: Mr. Monje you answered this recently in the House and gave an answer that was a long paragraph and--and it didn't answer it. So I'm going to try, I don't actually expect to get an answer because I have asked you this before but are you able to answer yes or no whether you consider yourself a neutral public forum? </p><p>MONJE: I didn't testify in the House, sir. I--I will answer the same way which is-- </p><p>CRUZ: Okay, please--please do that. </p><p>MONJE: --which is that Twitter is an open Internet platform where people from all stripes and political affiliations all around the globe come and speak. </p><p>CRUZ: Okay. Let me help you recently. Let--let--let me help you. So recently the CEO of--of Twitter Jack Dorsey said quote I don't believe that we can afford to take a neutral stance anymore. I don't believe that we should optimize for neutrality. Does this represent the policy of Twitter? </p><p>MONJE: I have not seen that quote, sir. </p><p>CRUZ: Do you agree with it? </p><p>MONJE: That is not how he is building the platform and how everybody who comes to Twitter every day. I think it's important to note sir that three-quarters of our users are overseas and that we are a global company that is staffed globally. </p><p>CRUZ: All right. Mr. Potts, same question for Facebook. Does--does Facebook consider itself a neutral public form? </p><p>POTTS: Thank you, chairman. I think first and foremost we consider ourselves our technology company. We are a platform for diversity of viewpoints and we moderate those viewpoints of our community stand--standards. </p><p>CRUZ: Okay. I'm going to try one more time to get a yes or a no but--but your company has likewise consistently refused to answer this so I probably can't. Do--do you consider yourself a neutral public--you have a choice you could be yes or no. I am fine either way. </p><p>POTTS: Again--again, chairman, we are a technology company. We have a mission to build a community to bring the world closer together. We try to do that through our community standards to ensure that diverse viewpoints are allowed on the platform. </p><p>CRUZ: All right let's--let's try a second area of inquiry. The ranking member suggested that there is no censorship and indeed she said there are just a handful of antidotes. You know I will note among other things that Senator Blackburn, her announcement video announcing for the United States Senate was pulled down as Mr. Monje rightly apologized for. </p><p>But yet these antidotes all seem to be consistently on one side of the spectrum. So--so let me ask a question, Mr. Monje. In the year 2018, how many tweets from elected officials did Facebook pull down? I'm sorry, Twitter pull out? </p><p>MONJE: I--I would have to get back to you on those specific cases. If--if I could follow up though, sir. Every day we see 500 million tweets and we have to action thousands of accounts and those happen literally all across the political spectrum and literally all over the globe. One in a million happens 500 times a day on Twitter and if you are looking for data points to support any narrative you can find it. We do have-- </p><p>CRUZ: Are you aware-- </p><p>MONJE: -- we do have a number-- </p><p>CRUZ: Are you aware of even a single Democratic politician who has had a tweet pulled down? I am not. </p><p>MONJE: I--I am. </p><p>CRUZ: Could you share that, please? </p><p>MONJE: Yes, sir, and I will note that we are as committed to transparency as--as--as you have described and have taken a number of steps to improve transparency. We also have to protect the privacy and security of our users, people who didn't ask to be part of the spotlight. But let me follow up on your question, sir. </p><p>CRUZ: Although to be fair someone is tweeting; they are asking the world to see what they are saying I mean that's the essence of a social media post as you are posting it. </p><p>MONJE: That's true but our actions on--on those accounts are also matters that are extremely sensitive and--and--but if I could follow up on your-- </p><p>CRUZ: Please. </p><p>MONJE: -- specific question. I am not going to mention specific names in a public forum but very recent examples we recently changed our impersonation policy that allows if--if I could sir you--you asked the question. Our impersonation policy that allows third--third parties to report impersonation and we had two current U.S. sitting senators, a sitting governor, and a sitting state attorney general, all Democrats, who were impacted by the. </p><p>Second case, advertising transparency we--we honored the ideas that were part of the Honest Ads Act and agree with the idea that political advertising should be more transparent. In the process of setting that up a number of accounts got caught up in that that include three current Democratic candidates for president and a major national pro-choice group. </p><p>Somebody mentioned the general data protection regulations out of Europe-- </p><p>CRUZ: Okay--okay. The time-- </p><p>MONJE: --the main--the main purpose being, sir, is that these folks didn't put out a press release about it. They--they called us. We--we do trainings to all members of Congress. </p><p>CRUZ: Well, Mr. Monje I appreciate you saying you will answer the questions when we provide them in writing. I would like to get specific answers to the question. Let--let me--let me pose it to Mr. Potts and I--I will point--Mr. Potts in 2018 how many posts from elected officials did Facebook pull down? </p><p>POTTS: Chairman, I--I don't have that figure but I'm happy to follow up with you at a later time. </p><p>CRUZ: Well, I would ask you to and I would note that when Mr. Zuckerberg testified before this full committee, I submitted that question and a number of other questions in writing to Facebook and you at the time refused to answer it and gave the company instead gave legal boilerplate and refused to answer the question. Nobody here knows, we know that Senator Blackburn's post was pulled down. </p><p>Let me--let me ask a comparable question because it's not just political, it's also ideological. There have been multiple instances of a particular pro-life groups being disfavored. For example here is a tweet that says abortion is profoundly anti-women and it is a quote from Mother Teresa and this tweet was blocked. Now it is fairly remarkable that Mother Teresa is now deemed hate speech. Do either of you would agree with the proposition that Mother Teresa is--is issuing hate speech? Is--is this hate speech? </p><p>MONJE: If I could take a step back from that I believe that--that account is from the Susan B. Anthony List-- </p><p>CRUZ: Correct. </p><p>MONJE: --and Susan B. Anthony is currently an advertiser in good standing on our platform. Last week--last promoted (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CRUZ: Mr. Monje you are very good at not answering questions. Is this hate speech? </p><p>MONJE: I--every--every tweet has context behind it and every decision that is made has context--. </p><p>CRUZ: Full tweet. There is no more context. </p><p>MONJE: I--I--I can tell you that we have action and accounts on both sides of this debate including tweets by pro---by pro-choice groups who have said that everybody who is pro-life is misogynistic. There are many pro-life groups that advertise on our platforms currently in good standing and advertisers across the board whether they are selling soap or NFL sometimes have advertisements that are caught in our--our systems. </p><p>CRUZ: And that is an area we will be following up as well. So I appreciate your saying there groups on the pro-choice side that you have blocked in this committee is going to attempt to understand and quantify if there is a disparate treatment or not. If there is not a disparate treatment that will benefit Twitter to show that you are being evenhanded. The antidotes we are aware of are consistently on one side of the aisle. Mr. Potts do--do you consider this hate speech? Does Facebook consider this hate speech? </p><p>POTTS: Chairman, I don't believe this was on our site but looking at that quote right now the lights are a little bright so my eyes are trying to zero in or focus I should say, that would not be in violation of our policies. </p><p>CRUZ: And same question that Mr. Monje was asked, are you--has Facebook to your knowledge ever blocked a post from Planned Parenthood? </p><p>POTTS: I--I believe that is correct. I believe we have, senator. </p><p>CRUZ: Okay. We would be very interested in learning about that. When I ask Facebook that in writing after--after Mr. Zuckerberg's hearing you again refused to answer that question as well. And--and so the basic data if you are not engaged in censorship, releasing the data how many people you are blocking, how many people you are downgrading and what side of the political aisle or ideological aisle they are would go a long way to either clearing it up or to demonstrating there is a persistent pattern of bias. Senator Hirono? </p><p>HIRONO: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>CRUZ: Senator, you--you may take the time you like. </p><p>HIRONO: But I see there are all of these people so you know I don't want to take up their--let's try to stick with five minutes. </p><p>CRUZ: I'll tell you what when you chair the committee you can decide on the time. </p><p>HIRONO: I hope that day come soon. We will do our best to be really amicable around here. So Mr. Potts how many postings are on Facebook every day? </p><p>POTTS: Thank you ranking member. There are over a billion postings on Facebook every day. That includes images, text post, videos and other types of content. </p><p>HIRONO: 1 billion and Twitter, Mr. Monje? </p><p>MONJE: It's Monje, thank you so much. </p><p>HIRONO: You said 500 million tweets-- </p><p>MONJE: Yes--yes, ma'am. </p><p>HIRONO: --every single day. And I think both of you said you are not perfect in your efforts to try and get rid of some of the dangerous, violent, hateful content. I think both--did both of you say that? </p><p>MONJE: Yes, ma'am. </p><p>HIRONO: And neither one of you is perfect, your companies? </p><p>POTTS: No, ma'am. </p><p>HIRONO: Okay. So with 1 billion postings every single day, 500 million every single day would it be accurate for me to say that I could find all kinds of in fact as to one of our other witnesses I found you know just yesterday all kinds of what I would say totally false allegations about that so I probably could find all kinds of things that are on Facebook right now that in my view should be taken down but I don't expect you all to be perfect. So it's in that context. </p><p>Let's just make it really plain and clear. Do your platforms discriminate against conservative users? Do your algorithms have something that says these are the kinds of words that conservatives use so we are just going to get rid of those postings? Or tweets? </p><p>POTTS: Ranking member, our algorithms, our policies, our enforcement we do not suppress any type of views whether conservative or liberal. </p><p>HIRONO: So you don't have any algorithm that says here are the kind of words and the areas that they go to and we are just going to get rid of them? You don't have anything like that? </p><p>POTTS: No, senator. </p><p>HIRONO: What about you? </p><p>MONJE: No, ma'am. Party affiliation and political ideology is never an input. </p><p>HIRONO: So do your--do either of your platforms discriminate against conservative content? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, we review our content under our community standards. If it violates our community standards, we apply those community standards evenly despite political ideology. </p><p>HIRONO: So your community standards, by the way, is a little bit different than when you said that you try to ID and remove violent, hateful or dangerous content but the community standards are a little bit broader or different than those three (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>POTTS: I'm sorry. Thank--thank you, senator. They are a bit more broad. They do include those but they cover over 22 sections. They are--we are transparent with their community standards. The same guidelines that our reviewers use to moderate content, those are available at Facebook.com\\communitystandards for the public to review so that the public also knows how to regulate their behavior on the platform. </p><p>HIRONO: Does Twitter have something that's akin to Facebook's community standards? </p><p>MONJE: Yes, ma'am. We call them our terms of service and they are available at help.twitter.com. </p><p>HIRONO: Terms of service. </p><p>MONJE: Terms of service. </p><p>HIRONO: OK. But you also try to ID and remove violent, hateful or dangerous content? </p><p>MONJE: That's right. Yes. We have--we have a--a range of rules. </p><p>HIRONO: Does a user's political party affiliation play an application of a company's con--content moderation policies? In fact--are your users supposed to identify them their political affiliations before they use your platforms? </p><p>MONJE: No, ma'am. </p><p>HIRONO: How are you even supposed to know what their political affiliations are? Do you? Certainly, you don't ask for them, right? OK. Now there--there are some things that really--you are huge entities. I agree with the chairman on that. So, after the trag--tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 the families didn't even have time to buy their chi--bury, sorry, their children before conspiracy theories began to spread around the internet claiming that the shooting was all a hoax. I understand that many of the families reached out to each of your companies to remove these lies, but that most of their requests went unanswered. The content was only removed if it included a photo or a video protected by copyright. Why did your companies allow these lies on your platforms even after they had been identified by the families? You can start, Mr. Potts. </p><p>POTTS: Thank you, senator. We now have strong policies to prevent that type of behavior. My--my heart goes out to the--the members here who have a connection to Sandy Hook and o--other violent tragedies. If someone accuses a victim of a violent tragedy as--as being a crisis actor or that it never happened--we do remove that content as of today. </p><p>HIRONO: You saw my board right there and it's still on there. I don't know if that's Facebook though. I don't want to accuse the wrong company. </p><p>POTTS: I believe that is all Google, ma'am. </p><p>HIRONO: OK. Who is not here today? OK. I wish they were here. So, why--you say that you now have policies--when did you adopt those policies? </p><p>POTTS: I will have to go back to check to confirm, but it was a--about a year maybe a little over a year ago. </p><p>HIRONO: It took you quite a while a--after the tragedy 2012. I'd like to have Mr. Monje answer also before we move on. </p><p>MONJE: Thank you, senator. It is a terrible tragedy. I just met Mr. Parker and our hearts break for--for his families and those that lost loved ones. We have also updated our internal abusive behavior policy to make clear that targeting other people with content that denies that violent events happened is against--is against our rules. </p><p>HIRONO: When did you update your policy? </p><p>MONJE: It was last year. </p><p>HIRONO: So, it took both of you quite a long time to get to that. I would ask that--that well, now that you have these policies then I guess I--I'm hopeful that these kinds of lies against individuals do not get on your platforms. Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Would Senator Hirono like any additional time? </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. Actually, yes. </p><p>CRUZ: OK. </p><p>HIRONO: Google is not here and so, I mentioned in my opening statement that I'm disappointed we don't have a witness from Google. And Google was ready and willing to send its acting director of political and stakeholder outreach, Max Pappas to testify. You rejected Google's offer. And my staff offered to invite Mr. Pappas as a minority witness. They were told by your staff they could not do so because they had been told that no Google witness would be permitted to testify at the hearing. And in fact, Mr. Pappas is at the same level of responsibility as our two other witnesses right now. So, I would like to enter into the record--I would like to ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record the testimony of Mr. Pappas. </p><p>CRUZ: Without--without objection. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Senator Lee. </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to both---both of you for being here. This is an important issue and I think it's important to remember that any time we're talking about speech and someone brings up hate speech there is a difference of course, between what could lawfully be prohibited if we were talking about government prohibition on speech on the one hand and speech that someone hates on the other hand. And I'd--I'd like to start with you, Mr. Potts--can you tell me, Facebook has a different standard for content generated by a user who is not a paid advertiser versus paid advertisements. Is that right? </p><p>POTTS: That is correct, senator. Content policies apply to all u--user generated content. That's the community standards. That is the baseline. For advertisers, there are more stringent standards that sit on top of that--of those policies. </p><p>LEE: OK. And the reason for that is you--you are being paid for that content and you feel a responsibility to moderate that content at a greater degree is that roughly accurate? </p><p>POTTS: Yes. </p><p>LEE: OK. Are you--you familiar with an instance a few months ago in which Susan B. Anthony Lists topic that came up in a slightly different context a few minutes ago--ran a couple of ads dealing with two prematurely born babies survived--Charlotte Ryan and Micah Pickering. </p><p>POTTS: Yes, senator. I am definitely familiar with the Micah Pickering example. Maybe a little less so with the Charlotte Ryan. </p><p>LEE: OK. So, let's go with the Micah Pickering example. I met Micah Pickering is a healthy, happy little boy now. His images were featured in an advertisement purchased by the Susan B. Anthony List in order to promote life. In order to promote the idea that children--even children born very prematurely in the range of 20 to 22 gestational weeks can still survive and go on to live as ha--happy, healthy human beings. And as I recall, that advertisements was taken back down by Facebook. Is that right? </p><p>POTTS: I believe that's correct. And I believe we reinstated that advertisement within 24 hours. </p><p>LEE: OK. At--at the time what was Facebook's explanation for why it was taken down? </p><p>POTTS: I--I think it violated one of our advertising policies. </p><p>LEE: Which policy would that have been? </p><p>POTTS: I believe it was around--we have a policy around somewhat graphic content, and someone viewed that to be graphic. I think that exactly it was the sensationalism policy, senator. </p><p>LEE: OK. Graphic content. Perhaps because it involved a medical procedure or perhaps because it depicted an infant in--in a position where an infant had tubes going into it or something like that. </p><p>POTTS: It is a medical procedure. </p><p>LEE: OK. A medical procedure going on that's depicted and that's regarded as graphic. Does your policy work evenhandedly such that regardless of whether we are talking about prolife versus prochoice what if the same image were depicted in a slightly different context--not advertising perhaps a--a prochoice cause but just another cause unrelated to prolife? For example, what if that same image of Micah Pick--Pickering or series of images had been used in the context of an advertisement designed to focus on the dangers a--associated with drug abuse a by a mother carrying a child? </p><p>POTTS: Thank you, senator. It--if it was the same picture, I am assuming that the same policy would have been applied, the--hopefully the same way. We like consistency there. As you know, that if there are different pictures that would perhaps force either the au--excuse me--either the automation or the reviewer to make a--come to a different decisions. So, if a child is viewed that is 20 weeks maybe versus 24 weeks I--I know that's very narrow for the reviewer it may be different, but if the-- </p><p>LEE: Surely the reviewer is not going to be able to differentiate between-- </p><p>POTTS: --Right-- </p><p>LEE: --22 and 24 weeks surely that's not going to make a distinction. </p><p>POTTS: I don't want to--I don't want to try to get too nuanced there. But I--depending on if the--the view was this was too graphic, and I think because of the image which I--which I recall that decision was made although hit was made incorrectly to disallowed the--the ad. </p><p>LEE: But, in fact, Mr. Potts this is not hypothetical is it? This has happened. We did, in fact, see the Susan B. Anthony List advertisement taken down while we had corresponding--images used in advertisements that have not been taken down is that right? </p><p>POTTS: We have, again, I don't think we've had the same image used. </p><p>LEE: That's not the same image. </p><p>POTTS: Right. </p><p>LEE: But a--an image of an infant in a comparably vulnerable position. </p><p>POTTS: And I think it alt--and senator, I think it all turns on the word comparably. I think there were similar images, but not the same image. So, it makes the comparison a bit more difficult. But if they were the same image, I would expect them to have both been taken down by that same reviewer with a misapplication of our policies. </p><p>LEE: And what explanation can you provide for me as to why one might have been taken down and the other not. Regardless of whether you say they should have been consistent with Facebook's policy what might account for why they might receive differential treatment? </p><p>POTTS: Sometimes--senator I--I would like to say that as we mentioned, we review billions of posts and other pieces of content. Sometimes we make mistakes. In this case the reviewer that reviewed that piece of content with Micah he removed it incorrectly or he or she removed it incorrectly. If that's the case, I would expect that reviewer to make the same mistake not--regardless of who shared that image. Now, if we take a different image run by the SBA, run by anyone and place it there and he would--and if that person were to allow it, I would assume they would allow it across the board as well. I don't know if I'm doing a great job explaining that but I'm-- </p><p>LEE: No, I--I think I understand what you're suggesting, and I--I understand and appreciate the point. Could it not also have to do with other factors including possibly who is more likely to complain about the Susan B. Anthony image? Who is more likely to work at Facebook? Could that have something to do with it? </p><p>POTTS: I--I don't believe so, senator. I think to a question of whether someone would try to influence a decision with their bias that's something that we really try to exclude to bring out a process to check any type of bias at the door. We have a very strong managing bias curriculum within the company. It's a rigorous program. I've never been in a position where I've written a policy or made a--an enforcement decision or sat with a product team building an engineering product where someone asked anyone's political affiliation or whether they were prolife or prochoice. Again, this one seems like a mistake I would have expect it to be made no matter who posted it. </p><p>LEE: OK. The chair is politely and gently reminded me that I'm over my time limit. I'm going to want to get back to this later. And I got to go cast a vote. I do think it's worth mentioning here it is something I consider a mathematical impossibility that there isn't a subjective component to this that involves who is reviewing it. You can't entirely mechanize this. You can't program it into an AI feature to--to monitor this. It--it seems to me mathematically impossible to suggest there isn't some subjective judgment calling going on and some of that might not be impacted by who works there. Now, Facebook is a private company. I differ from some of my colleagues in the approach I take to this. I don't view you as a public utility. I don't view you as being owned by the government. But some of my colleagues see it differently. And so, that's why it's important for us to flag this. As long as some of my colleagues see it that way I think this is something that your company ought to focus on, ought to try to work to resolve. We'll get back to that later. Thank you, madam chair. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you. And before I get to my questions and we do have a vote on the board, Mr. Monje, you mentioned the GDPR. Let me just say privacy as we know it, as the world knows it today primarily is something the U.S. has led the way in creating privacy law. And then when you see this European style privacy that is GDPR you know that Europe doesn't have the most innovative and dynamic economy in the major players in this market are going to be U.S. companies. And needing to have a privacy standard, one set of rules for the entire ecosystem is the reason that I've reintroduced the Browser Act today so that we can do that. </p><p>Let me just touching on content for a second and we all I think have hoped that you would have a diversity of opinion in your platforms and that it would be a town square. And I know Facebook has a 27-page memo on censorship. And we would hope that while you are rooting out violence and terrorist propaganda and keeping that off your pages that you also are having your reviewers and your community that sets that--those standards and those that live and work there in California aware that free speech requires that they be respectful of speech with which they do not agree. And we would hope that you all would go back to California focused on exercising that with that respect to the law and respect to individuals. I've got a few questions. </p><p>Mr. Potts, should Facebook promote spirited debate on all sides of the political spectrum? And we'll do these as yes or no. </p><p>POTTS: Thank you, senator. Yes, we allow spirited debate on all sides (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BLACKBURN: Mr. Monje, same question. </p><p>MONJE: Yes, ma'am. </p><p>BLACKBURN: OK. Mr. Potts, should Facebook allow ads urging that we save sea turtles or baby seals? </p><p>POTTS: I believe that would be fine. </p><p>BLACKBURN: OK. Mr. Monje, should Twitter allow ads that denounce Planned Parenthood for selling baby body parts? </p><p>MONJE: Ma'am, thank you for that question and I--I'd like to again apologize-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes or no. Yeah. </p><p>MONJE: Every--every ad is--is judged with-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes or no is good. </p><p>MONJE: Then we made a mistake on your ad and I apologize. </p><p>BLACKBURN: OK. Mr. Monje, should Twitter allow ads from Starbucks and Patagonia? </p><p>MONJE: If they follow our terms of service. </p><p>BLACKBURN: And Mr. Potts, should Facebook allow ads from Chic-fil-a and Hobby Lobby? </p><p>POTTS: If they follow our ad's policies. </p><p>BLACKBURN: OK. And who sets those policies? </p><p>POTTS: They are a teammates of mine. We have separate teams that work on ads policies. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Are they subjective or objective? </p><p>POTTS: They are--they are meant to be objective. </p><p>BLACKBURN: They are meant to be objective. </p><p>POTTS: They--they are-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: Do people bring their attitudes to work with them? Their political attitudes to work with them. </p><p>POTTS: I--I was incorrect on my statement--they are objective and-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: OK. </p><p>POTTS: --and we--we try to strive for (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>BLACKBURN: OK. Mr. Monje, should Twitter equally provide democrats and republicans in search rankings? </p><p>MONJE: Yes. And we strive to. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Mr. Potts, same question. </p><p>POTTS: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, senator. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Should you e--equally promote democrats and republicans in the search rankings? </p><p>POTTS: Yes--yes, senator. </p><p>BLACKBURN: OK. And Mr. Potts, should Facebook equally promote articles from all news sources whether they're from the Wall Street Journal or the Washington Post? </p><p>POTTS: For those two yes--yes, senator. </p><p>BLACKBURN: OK. We've got a presidential year coming up in 2020, so Mr. Monje please tell me what Twitter is doing to prepare its platform for censorship free debate. </p><p>MONJE: Thank you so much, senator. We--we--people come to Twitter to figure out what's going on the world and never is that more important than during elections. We spent a great amount of time in the lead up to the mid-term elections, which were the most tweeted about mid-term elections in history. We dramatically improved our ability to find e--efforts of disinformation, improved our partnerships with all the major parties with the government and with NGOs to figure out vectors of threats. And we had, what we believe, was an incredibly clean election. And as the world turns there are additional elections in the EU, Japan, India, in Israel yesterday. And we are going to continue to try to improve our systems to find disinformation, to make sure that there is greater context about who is speaking. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Now, I know Facebook has hired a news director. Have you all hired a news director? </p><p>MONJE: We are structured differently than Facebook. We do--I--as a platform we are running towards news and work with news publishers of all--all sorts to make sure that they can get their-their products out on our--on our platform. </p><p>BLACKBURN: OK. And Mr. Potts, Facebook's plan--their strategy for 2020? </p><p>POTTS: Thank you, senator. We've hired over 30,000 people that focus on safety and security. We made significant investments in what we call our election integrity. We have full time standing teams that are now focused on many of the elections in the world whether it be the EU, India, Israel as we mentioned yesterday. But definitely focused on 2020 within the United States to ensure we are out in front and to prevent any abuse that could occur on the platform. </p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you. At this point, I'm going to have the committee stand in recess as we are in the middle of the vote I need to get to the floor and the chairman will return. And we will continue questions with the first panel. </p><p>(RECESS) </p><p>CRUZ: The hearing is back in order. Senator Hawley. </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and thank you for permitting me to participate in today's--today's hearing. Mr. Monje, let's talk about--first of all, let me just say that I enjoyed your testimony about Mother Teresa and why she was or was not engaging in hate speech. I thought your inability to answer that question was absolutely hilarious and really indicative of the lack of transparency that your company is engaging in. So let me just ask you a few more pointed questions. The account for the movie Unplanned, why was it suspended? </p><p>MONJE: Thank you for that question, sir. I'll note that the Mother Teresa quote is currently still on Twitter. </p><p>HAWLEY: But you wouldn't say whether or not it was hate speech. </p><p>MONJE: If I could--what was your question again, sir? </p><p>HAWLEY: Right. The record will reflect that you would not say whether or not it was hate speech. That's what I said I thought was hilarious. My question is why was the movie for the--the account for the movie Unplanned band? </p><p>MONJE: Thank you, sir. It was--what we discovered--we have a system that tries to stop people have broken our rules in the past to come--from coming back on. The individual who started the @unplannedmovie account had previously been suspended for breaking our rules. And as a result, our automated systems flagged that account and--and it was taken down for an hour. </p><p>HAWLEY: And are all of the--will let me ask you this. I'll come back to that. Why it was the conservative columnist Jesse Kelly banned? </p><p>MONJE: We have been in contact with him about what he did and he understands the rules that he's broken. This is a challenge of a platform as broad as Twitter where people are doing things that are not always visible to the public and we can't comment because of his privacy and security, but it was a significant violation and one that we stand by. </p><p>HAWLEY: So is it--is it algorithms that are making these decisions about who is--who is de-platformed and when? </p><p>MONJE: We use a combination of machine learning and human review. </p><p>HAWLEY: Tell me about the human review. </p><p>MONJE: We have a team that's global. We are headquartered in San Francisco, but we have offices in Dublin and Singapore and just about every time zone in between. Three quarters of our users are overseas, and we try to have a global workforce that can deal with the fact that cultural context are extremely difficult. </p><p>HAWLEY: So the review team is--consists of quite a few people is what you're telling me? </p><p>MONJE: We have 4000 people globally. </p><p>HAWLEY: 4000 people on the review team globally? </p><p>MONJE: 4000 people at twitter. </p><p>HAWLEY: But how many people on the review team though? </p><p>MONJE: I'd have to get back to you on the specifics </p><p>HAWLEY: It's significant though. It's--it's across sites, as not just in San Francisco? </p><p>MONJE: Yes, sir. </p><p>HAWLEY: What are the protocols that the review team follows question mark is there a protocol that they follow? </p><p>MONJE: There are--there are protocols on any number of issues, yes, sir. </p><p>HAWLEY: Including about de-platforming? </p><p>MONJE: Let me explain-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --First, just answer that question. Is there protocol? </p><p>MONJE: There are many workflows and protocols--and-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Will you make those public? </p><p>MONJE: We make our terms of service public and we-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Will you make the protocols public for the review of when you ban people like the Unplanned movie and Jesse Kelly? Will you make those--those protocols as it relates to the human reviewers, will you make those public? </p><p>MONJE: I think you're--you're aiming at a very important question, which is transparency. </p><p>HAWLEY: Why don't you just first answer my question? Will you make those public? Will you commit today to me--you said earlier that you are a pro transparency company, that you want to embrace transparency, so you have your chance now. Tell us you'll make the protocols public. Will you make them public? </p><p>MONJE: It's not up to me to make them public, sir. </p><p>HAWLEY: Will--will you advocate for making them public? </p><p>MONJE: We--our team will get back to you, sir. </p><p>HAWLEY: So that's a no. You are--you are--you will not commit today to making your protocols public? </p><p>MONJE: I--I am a--a senior and an executive-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --So you won't--you won't say whether-- </p><p>MONJE: --But I don't have the authority to do that-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Or not Mother Teresa's speech is hate speech, you won't tell us really why Unplanned was banned, you won't tell us why Jesse Kelly speech is banned, you say now that you've admitted that there are human--there is human involvement in these decisions but there are in fact numerous people involved, there are protocols but you won't make them public. Have I got that right? </p><p>MONJE: I told you why Unplanned movie was--was banned--was--was taken down for an hour and I've told you why Jesse Kelly was kicked off the platform-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --No you didn't-- </p><p>MONJE: --And if you want more details you could ask him-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --You said you couldn't tell me because of privacy concerns. No, no, no, no. You said you couldn't tell me for privacy concerns related to him and now you're saying that you do have protocols, but you won't make those public. Yet you are a transparency company. </p><p>MONJE: Can I tell--can I see about some of the steps that we take to do exactly what you're describing? Which is every six months, we put out a report it's called the Twitter transparency report. We report-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --How about this-- </p><p>MONJE: --We report across six--- </p><p>HAWLEY: --How about you submit those for the record? How about this, will you commit to a third-party audit? I've called on Jack to do a third-party audit of potential bias within Twitter. Will you commit to doing that? Will you say yes? </p><p>MONJE: I--we take a number of steps to improve transparency-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --No, will you say yes to a third-party audit? Answer my question. </p><p>MONJE: We have a Twitter transparency report every six months. </p><p>HAWLEY: That's not a third-party audit. </p><p>MONJE: We release--we released to a third party, Lumen, the-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Will you commit to having an independent third-party do an audit of Twitter? </p><p>MONJE: I will invite you to look at-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --So that's a no-- </p><p>MONJE: --transparency.twitter.com and see-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --You're telling me no. All right, thank you very much-- </p><p>MONJE: --Where--where we are not-- </p><p>HAWLEY: --Mr. Potts, limit just ask you, you--Facebook has done internal investigations into political bias and you've done at least one audit related to housing discrimination prompted by Senator Booker. Will you make the results of those investigations public? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, that is correct. And to the extent we can, we will make them public. We are undergoing an--an assessment currently by Senator Kyle that you may be familiar with. I don't have the status of that now, but we are happy to get back to you. </p><p>HAWLEY: Will--will Facebook commit to doing an unbiased third-party audit on your search and banned practices to determine whether or not there's little bias? </p><p>POTTS: I believe that is what Senator Kyle is looking at. He's looking at a number of things that may lead to more information on unconscious bias, unconscious bias against conservatives. I know he has met with over 130 leading conservative voices with some members of Congress at this point as well. </p><p>I did not know what the current progress of that report is. I want to give Senator Scott Kyle enough space to carry out his activity. He's very diligent person, as you all know, but we expect that report to be very illuminating and hopefully not showing bias, but we want to give him the space to complete. </p><p>HAWLEY: All right, my time has expired and letter--let me just say thanks again to the chair for letting me participate. If--if your companies are truly committed to transparency and you're telling us that they are, and I think the public deserves to have some answers. They deserve to have you be actually transparent. And yet this committee shows--this committee hearing again today shows that you are anything but transparent and you apparently have no interest in becoming more transparent. </p><p>This is a huge, huge problem and I would hope, for the sake of the customers that you serve and the values you purport to represent, that you would change your behavior and change your commitments to--to providing a neutral, unbiased platform for all users in this country. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Senator Sasse. </p><p>SASSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman for hosting this hearing and to the two of you for showing up. And I'm glad that were going to have another one of these with Google. Can we just all agree that this is an incredible only in America conversation, right? I mean, the--the fact that this is happened, they were having this kind of conversation is an American thing. And the fact that your companies exist is because we are a free space--free speech, open society, First Amendment society. </p><p>Obviously, the First Amendment has a prohibition on--Congress shall make no law, so not everything about the First Amendment applies exactly to your companies. There are important debates about publishers versus platforms, but do you agree that your companies exist in America for all sorts of reasons about the America ecosystem? </p><p>POTTS: We are proud to be an American company. </p><p>MONJE: Yes, sir. </p><p>SASSE: So your--your company's aren't from Vietnam, they aren't from North Korea, they aren't from China, and the stew that exists in those places wouldn't have created companies like yours. And so the fact that we are having this conversation is an expressly American cultural and economic and atmospherics kind of conversation. Do you relate to why so many Americans are so uncomfortable with the consolidation of power in your company's and with the fact that, even though I appreciate your answer, Mr. Potts and--pronounce your last name for me again. </p><p>MONJE: Thank you, sir. Monje. </p><p>SASSE: Monje. I've heard it a few different ways today. I wanted to get it right. I appreciate that you both said you are American companies but lots of people in America wonder if you think you're global companies and not American companies and that leaves a lot of people uncomfortable. Do you recognize that problem? </p><p>MONJE: That--that is--and you know, three quarters of our users are overseas and we are headquartered in San Francisco and there are values that we've carried out and--and I think for some of the reasons that we are described in the--in the dais earlier, there are places around the globe where criticizing the government is--is against the law. There are places against--and the government--in and around the world where being gay is punishable by death. And these are--these are not values that we share and that we don't carry through around the globe. </p><p>But you're 100 percent right. There is a combination of--American ingenuity and education system and the legal system that includes both the First Amendment and CDA 230 that has enabled American leadership around the globe. </p><p>SASSE: Mr. Potts. </p><p>POTTS: I--I agree with that. As you know, we are based in, excuse me, Menlo Park, California. We are a company with a user base that has--is 87 percent located outside of the United States, so were global in nature. We have policies that apply to the global community, but we are proud, again, to be a--an American company and we recognize the ingenuity, we recognize the--the environment for innovation that exist in America, and we're happy to be here. </p><p>SASSE: So I've spent a lot of time with and around both of your companies--and some of your incredible workforce and you have unbelievable talent and--and your boards have gigantic brains, and yet it does feel to many of us like creative destruction is a huge part of how Silicon Valley created all of the stuff that you're talking about and then the--the innovation culture that comes from that is something that seems to also now be--I want to get my verbs right, I don't want to say held captive to certain cultural and--and political views inside your company, but when you--you used the term a little bit ago by--what was it, unconscious bias, what was--what was the term you used? </p><p>POTTS: Yes, senator I think I used the term unconscious bias, which I mean to say is bias is really to kind of cultural bias. I think we all come with our different perspectives and it's a--incumbent upon us all to manage that bias and not allow that to influence our decisions. </p><p>SASSE: Fair enough and agreed. And so when Senator Cruz opened this hearing and was using some of the abortion debate examples, I think we all know it isn't the case that there sort of an equal number of accidental anecdotes that are on the abortion-rights side of the debate and on the pro-life side of the debate. Inside your company--your companies are not at all representative of America. It isn't your job to be elected officials that represent all of America, but it just isn't the case that you're sort of a neutral form for speech and as you work those things out, pro-life people aren't going to be heard equally insider companies. </p><p>And so those messy things require us to have big important conversations and debates about them and--and to Senator Hawley's point, there are times when it sounds just unbelievably opaque. The language of transparency is used, and yet it's almost impossible to get straight answers many times from the companies. Senator Blackburn is no longer here and I was off voting, so maybe she asked some of you some of these questions, but my guess is, and when I called a bunch of people on your boards when the--her campaign video was taken down because it had some pro-life components in it, my guess is she didn't get any real clear explanation of how and why that happened. </p><p>I respect your apology, I assume she accepted it, but it didn't happen accidentally. It happened because there are all sorts of assumptions built into your companies that are not at all clear to people who don't know what they are signing up for when they sign up for the platforms. </p><p>So I guess the question I would ask is, I don't think the American people have a lot of confidence that the messy problems of principled pluralism are somehow going to be easily solved by an algorithm. I don't think it's true. Quantification is a huge part of why we are living at this economic boom moment in human history. We are all unbelievably blessed because of the powers of big data and big quantification and your companies obviously depend on that. But qualification, quality is ultimately more important than quantity and there is no way that quantity is ultimately going to solve these qualitative debates about pluralism. </p><p>So when you all talk about community standards and in the language of hate speech comes up, it--I think I would ask Senator Blackburn, or the way Senator Cruz asked it with the Mother Teresa quote is, do you believe that a pro-life position is tantamount tent amount to hate speech? I know you're both going to say no now, but do you really--tell us what the debate looks like inside your company about hate speech and about extreme viewpoints. Can you define hate speech? </p><p>POTTS: I'll--senator, thank you. I'll take a stab at it. I've given you the definition from a first Facebook position, but I--we're also recognizing that there is no uniform definition of hate speech across the globe. So at Facebook, the way we define hate speech is an attack against a person or a group of people based on their protected characteristic like race, gender, religion, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation as well as serious disability. </p><p>We define attack to mean something like using words that are dehumanizing, calls for violence, contempt or disgust, exclusion or segregation. But I think your point is--is the accurate one is to how do you draw those lines to allow a free flow of ideas, to allow a debate, but also for us to keep the community safe. So we, on my team and the teams that I work with, we really fight the--through that, that struggle of balancing voice versus safety. </p><p>So we want to give voice to more people. We err on the side of giving voice. There is a lot of content that I find perhaps offensive, maybe some of you all would also find offensive as well, that we allow on the platform because it doesn't violate our policies. But when we draw the line and we say that this--this type of speech is going to lead to violence, it is dehumanizing, we do remove it under our policies and-- </p><p>SASSE: --So I don't mean to-- </p><p>POTTS: --Yeah-- </p><p>SASSE: --Be rude, I don't want to interrupt you. If we had a lot more time here-- </p><p>POTTS: --Sure-- </p><p>SASSE: --But I just want to ask a precise point on that because I--I'm well over my time right now. A lot of the context of this debate is around the pro-life movement. And when you bring up violence, can you--I mean, there's violence in an abortion. It's in the abortion. Can you explain to me how the pro-life position is in any way violent and how any community standards could ever stay say a pro-life person's speech should be shut down because somehow there's a--I just--I don't follow from this how--I can understand how you could--you could say that a whole bunch of positions that are advocating the most extreme abortion laws that exist on earth. </p><p>The U.S., China, North Korea and Vietnam are the only nations that allow abortion until moments before delivery. Out of 200 countries, there are four on earth that do that. We are one of those four. There's clearly violence associated with that conversation. It's on the abortion advocate side of the debate. How is the pro-life side ever guilty of something that equates to violence question mark like, how could a pro-life position ever be shut down because of safety? </p><p>POTTS: That's a great question, senator And to be clear, a lot of this depends on intent and the context of statements or images or videos that are shared, so it's hard to do the hypothetical. But in general pro-life position would not be violating our community standards for hate speech. I--the Mother Teresa quote did not--would not violate ours and--and to be--just for complete transparency, we consult a range of groups across the spectrum, across all lyrical ideologies to try to help inform our policies. </p><p>Now, we own the policies, like, we write them, they are ours. We own them, but we do--we do talk to a lot of groups to make sure that we are landing, not being too aggressive on any area, making sure that we try to strike that right balance between voice and safety. </p><p>SASSE: Thanks. Thanks for being here. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Senator Sasse I want to turn to the topic of shadow bans. Does Twitter or Facebook engage in shadow bans? </p><p>MONJE: No, sir. </p><p>POTTS: No, chairman. </p><p>CRUZ: So Mr. Monje, and I apologize earlier for mispronounce in your name. Monje, is that correct? </p><p>MONJE: Thank you for asking, sir. It's hard. It's Monje. </p><p>CRUZ: Monje, okay. </p><p>MONJE: Yes, sir. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank--thank--thank you for clarifying. Monje. Mr. Monje, you--you testified before that--or you acknowledged that Twitter will downgrade a comment to make it less visible. Does twitter notify a person if their comment has been downgraded? </p><p>MONJE: If I could explain and how some of our algorithms work and it's--it's precisely the kind of difficult puts and takes that--that Senator Sasse was--was mentioning earlier. </p><p>CRUZ: I'd ask you to do so briefly. </p><p>MONJE: Very briefly. What we do, and we are transparent in our rules about--about the fact that we do this, that if we have signals that indicate that a person is being spamming, meaning, they are using multiple accounts to do the same thing, if they are using automated activity but we are not 100 percent sure that they're breaking the rules, if they've been abusive, then what we will do is make it harder for that content to be found in a couple of different places. One is in search results and the other is in--as in conversations, in replies. </p><p>CRUZ: Let me ask you the question again. When you downgrade a tweet, do you notify the person that you've downgraded? </p><p>MONJE: We--I'd have to get back to you on that, sir. </p><p>CRUZ: Okay. I believe the answer is no and--in the if the answer is no and if the answer is no--that, as far as I can tell, is all but indistinguishable from shadow. Now let me-- </p><p>MONJE: --At no point sir--at no point, sir, is a person's followers unable to find what that person--what that person has tweeted-- </p><p>CRUZ: --But if it's downgraded so far--so far fewer people see it, that is exactly what is being alleged on shadow banning. Now, let me take a different aspect of it. In the opening round of questions, the ranking member asked both of you, and I tried to write this down as fast as I can, something to the effect of she said do either of you say oh, these are the words conservatives use so we're just going to get rid of those--those positions, and--and both of you said no. </p><p>Mr. Monje, I'd like to refer you to a quote from a Twitter employee that was made public on a video this week in which, strikingly, he said almost verbatim what Senator Hirono asked. Mr. Parnay Singh said, who is a Twitter direct messaging engineer said, \"You look for Trump or America and you have, like, 5,000 keywords to describe a redneck. The majority of the machine learning algorithm are for Republicans.? </p><p>MONJE: Can--can I go back to the last quote that you had? In the break we actually had the opportunity had the opportunity to actually look up what you--the--the reason why is you took that quote out of context. If I could read the end of that quote on the-- </p><p>CRUZ: --Sure-- </p><p>MONJE: --At the end of what he said was you were saying neutrality is not what we are aiming for. He said, \"I do believe we should optimize for impartiality. You know, there is a difference there. To me, neutrality is a lot more passive, a lot more hands-off.\" So the end of the quote that you selectively picked was-- </p><p>CRUZ: --All right, how about this one-- </p><p>MONJE: --This was the project Veritas video where I'm sure you understand their methods, which we find it to be deplorable, which is they approach people in a social setting. So this person was not representing Twitter, he was speaking in a--in a social situation. Some of these interviews people thought they were on--on dates-- </p><p>CRUZ: --So is he a Twitter employee? </p><p>MONJE: When I was a--when I was a single man, I used to-- </p><p>CRUZ: --Is he a Twitter employee? </p><p>MONJE: If I could finish, I don't know if you is a current or--or past employee when he was in-- </p><p>CRUZ: --Is what he saying true or false? </p><p>MONJE: It's false. That's not--that's not our practices. We never use political ideology or party affiliation in any of our internal processes. That was big talk by some who thought he was on a date. </p><p>CRUZ: All right. Your testimony is this Twitter employees' statements were--were false. All right. </p><p>MONJE: That is not--that is not our--those aren't our practices. </p><p>CRUZ: Let me--Mr. Potts, you had a discussion with--with Senator Sasse about hate speech. I thought it was striking as you listed what you described as--as hate speech, you omitted one of the characteristics that you defined as hate speech, which is gender identity. Does--does Facebook consider the statement there are two genders to be hate speech? </p><p>POTTS: Depending on how that was shared, I would have to find out, but I do not believe so, Senator. That--that should be allowable. </p><p>CRUZ: Well, we will be interested and--and indeed I asked Facebook a whole series of questions about whether you have blocked posts along those lines--and in the entire debate about--about marriage and same-sex marriage, there are people who have different views of that question. But I asked Facebook in writing if some of the views that--that, if they are deemed hate speech, and--and Facebook refused to answer. </p><p>I will say also on the question of safety, you--you did respond to me in writing that, or Facebook did, rather, that people need to feel safe in order to build community. \"We are committed to removing content that encourages real-world harm. Including but not limited to,\" so it might be something else too, \"Physical, financial, or emotional injury.\" Now, I find it quite remarkable that--that Facebook is saying that, in your own words, you are committed to removing content that encourages emotional injury. That is about as nebulous a standard as I can imagine. </p><p>Let me give an example. My family--my aunt, my tia, Sonja, was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba by Castro's goons. Terms of emotional injury, I find it offensive people who praised Fidel Castro as a man of the--of the people. And yet, I would wager $1000 that Facebook does not consider language praising Fidel Castro as hate speech, even though for families that have suffered and been tortured at--at his goons' hands, that causes emotional injury. Do you agree with me? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, I think you're bringing up an interesting--an interesting point about the how--how things are shared on the platform, the context and intent. And it's often hard for us to understand the context and intent of something shared. Now, if someone was targeting you or targeting your--unfortunately targeting your aunt--your aunt or family member, with that type of language about a violent tragedy, we would actually remove that. But--but-- </p><p>CRUZ: --Sure, a direct--a direct threat of violence is qualitatively different from--from a policy position or political position that--that someone may be offended or disagree with. None of us have a right to live in a world free of being offended. We do have the ability to argue against it. And so it someone defends Castro as a man of the people, I'm more than happy to have that conversation with them. But silencing voices we disagree with is qualitatively different. </p><p>POTTS: I think if we--we are not in the--we do not seek to silence any voice. And I, just to be clear again, if someone was mocking or trying to bully the victim of a violent tragedy, we would remove that. I'm not familiar with the language I think in the question that you may have submitted for the record where we responded with the emotionals. I'm not exactly aware with that--of that language, so it's hard for me to surmise or--or understand exactly what was the intent of that response. But if someone wanted to target one of your family members that was the victim of a violent tragedy directly and mock them, we would remove that. </p><p>CRUZ: Have either of your company's done any internal studies to assess the extent of potential bias? </p><p>MONJE: Senator, I referenced one of them in my written testimony about the--the reach of members of Congress, which found a one to one correlation, the most important factor being the number of followers. </p><p>CRUZ: So I'm going to ask both of your companies if you've done any studies to submit those studies to the committee for review. </p><p>MONJE: Yes, sir. </p><p>CRUZ: Has Facebook done any studies? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, we are currently undergoing a study with Senator Kyle. He is--a continuous study. He has met with over 130 conservative voices at this time, some members of Congress, in fact other conservative voices. That study is ongoing. I'm not exactly sure where we are in the--in line with the study. We want to give him enough room to--to do it unimpeded. If it becomes public, we obviously will follow-up. </p><p>CRUZ: Have either of your companies or would either of your companies consider a verbatim quote from the Bible to be hate speech? </p><p>POTTS: No, senator. Senator, a verbatim quote that is used and cited, so it's a bit easier to understand maybe the context and the intent, we would allow that to remain on our platform. So religious-- </p><p>CRUZ: --And the Torah and the Koran the same? </p><p>POTTS: Religious texts, we would--we would allow. </p><p>CRUZ: Twitter? </p><p>MONJE: I--I'll have to get back to you on the specifics, but I believe it would be possible to quote any biblical or religious text in a way that is threatening to an individual, may God smite the down or something like that, which would be an attack on an individual. Again, the context really matters. </p><p>CRUZ: So absent a direct threat of physical violence? </p><p>MONJE: That sounds right, yes sir. </p><p>CRUZ: Twitter would not consider a quote from the Bible, the Koran, the Torah as--as hate speech and has not? </p><p>MONJE: The context matters and what the relationships and what the purpose of the speeches. </p><p>CRUZ: Okay, last--last question. Again, in writing I asked--asked Facebook when Mr. Zuckerberg testified about the ad rates you charge Democrats and Republicans. And in particular if the average ad rate, for example, for the Clinton campaign was comparable to the average add rate for the Trump campaign. Facebook refused to answer. </p><p>I also asked Obama versus Romney were the ad rates comparable. Facebook refused to answer. Indeed, Facebook refused to answer for any campaign. Do you know if there is a meaningful differential in the ad rates that Facebook charges Democrats versus Republicans? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, I'm here today to speak about our community standards. That's what I focus on. So I work on the development around user generated content. Those policies around user generated content. The ad space is not one that I'm very familiar with and I definitely do not know any of the charging rates. </p><p>CRUZ: Well, I would ask you to answer that. Same question for twitter. </p><p>MONJE: Thank you, sir. We unveiled last year the ads transparency center that gives people in America a chance to understand who is paying for--for an advertisement, how much money they spent, and what the--what the results of that at work. We're trying to be extremely transparent and we think it's important that people understand who is paying for those ads. </p><p>CRUZ: Senator Hirono. </p><p>HIRONO: See, the thing is that we are trying to show or at least the chairman is attempting to show that there actually is a conservative bias somehow through your algorithms, whatever, against conservative viewpoints. So do you think you would be a good idea, for example, for your companies to have an algorithm to make sure there are equal number of pro-choice and pro-life posts? </p><p>POTTS: No, senator </p><p>HIRONO: why not? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, I believe our group algorithm is designed to allow the free flow of ideas. If there are more pro-life posts, so be it. If there are more pro-choice posts, so be it. We just want the free flow of ideas to exist on--on the platform. </p><p>HIRONO: How about you, Mr. Monje? </p><p>MONJE: Yes, ma'am. Similar to what Facebook described, we have certain categories that we don't allow advertisers to touch, that we don't allow data scientists or data partners to touch and their--their political affiliation, things like that are--follow along those lines. </p><p>HIRONO: So we know that with 1 billion posts a day for Facebook, 500 million posts, well, tweets every single day, are there going to be some posts or tweets that are taken down that should not have been taken down. So I don't know whether it's the fault with your algorithms or there is a human factor going on, but there are lots and lots of pretty vile things on both of your platforms that I would wish could be taken down very. For example, it took you a long time, I would say both of you, to take down the shootings in New Zealand. It took a lot longer. And once it's out and out there, it can be retrieved. So it's out there. </p><p>So short of, in view my view, short of some kind of equivalency of the kind of content, I don't know how we are supposed to be assured that there is no bias. But as you say, the platform is open, you have all these people posting different things and it would seem as though, for example, just to use an example of--of choice, either choice or pro-life, that if you were to limit to an equal number, you're going to be pushing out a lot of posts that don't meet that numerical equivalent. So you know, I think--I think they're just a lot of problems with what we're talking about here. </p><p>So when we talk about whether or not there's been any kind of investigation into evidence of systemic political bias, I know that this is for you Mr. Potts, in 2016, the website Gizmodo reported that curators suppressed conservative stories on Facebook's trending news section. In response, Facebook launched an internal investigation. </p><p>I understand that the investigation found no evidence of systemic political bias, and that conservative and liberal topics were approved as trending topics at virtually identical rates. Can you provide some details about Facebook's internal review and what it found?  </p><p>POTTS: Senator, I believe that top line is correct, that we found no--no difference, no abuse of it--of that. The product, trending topics, has been discontinued, however. I do not have specifics at this point, but I'm happy to follow up if that's helpful. </p><p>HIRONO: So, this internal investigation, was that done by--I don't know what you mean by international investigation. You did it totally in-house? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, I will have to go back to my team, and we'll follow up with you. </p><p>HIRONO: Again for Mr. Potts, your opening statement, you stated \"unequivocally\" that Facebook does not favor one political viewpoint over another, nor does Facebook suppress conservative speech.  Yet you mention Facebook has brought in former Republican Senator John Kyl to work with conservative groups to suggest improvements to Facebook. </p><p>So, despite there being no evidence of anti-conservative bias that I've seen in this hearing, Facebook is bending over backwards to placate conservative complaints about bias. Why is Facebook working so hard to address complaints of bias that it claims doesn't exist, a position supported by the data? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, thank you for that question. I think we recognize where our company is located. It's located in the heart of Silicon Valley, and some may argue that Silicon Valley tends to be more liberal than not. We do a great job, in my opinion, of trying to manage our bias to ensure that we check your bias at the door. </p><p>I mentioned that I've never been asked to write a policy based off of a political ideology, or I've never been asked to make an enforcement decision based off a political ideology or sat on--with the product team as the engineers have developed a product and had that come into play. </p><p>That being said, I recognize that there is also the possibility of unconscious bias. And I think, when we try to review and ensure that there is no bias in the system, that you do these measures, that a mature company seeks to find out if they have the perchance unconscious bias in their product. So, both on--with Senator Kyl as well as with Laura Murphy, we have undergone two--Laura Murphy is a civil rights leader, a civil liberties lawyer as well, to ensure that we do not have bias on any side, whether it be civil rights against communities of color, other marginalized groups, whether it be against conservatives, to ensure that those do not get into our system. </p><p>HIRONO: So, you have senator--former Senator Kyl I guess representing the conservative perspective, and this civil rights activist representing the--the liberal perspective, so that you have both covered in your efforts to make sure there's no unconscious bias being reflected in your policies or in your algorithms. Is that--is that what you're telling me? </p><p>POTTS: We--we have--we have hired and engaged with those two individuals to do an assessment of our--of our policies, of our processes, of our product to ensure that there is no--is no bias, again. I am not of the believe that there is bias. I know the teams that I work with, that diversity of viewpoints that are through leadership, my team, and the teams that we are fortunate enough to share Facebook with at this time. But again, I--I recognize that we are also infallible (SIC), and we're doing our best to ensure that, if there was bias, that we can identify it and then stomp it out. </p><p>HIRONO: We've been hearing a lot about Senator Blackburn's advertisement being taken down. Earlier this year, Facebook removed ads posted by a Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. And in 2016, Mark Zuckerberg reprimanded Facebook staff for defacing Black Lives Matter postings on the walls of Facebook's campus. </p><p>Is this proof that Facebook is biased against liberals? Does Facebook plan to bring former Senator Claire McCaskill to meet with liberal groups, although you do have the civil rights activist, to offer suggestions on how Facebook can be improved, or is this an example of the acknowledgment that it's pretty tough to get it right perfectly? And we, of all people here, should know that, how tough it is to get things perfect around here. So, you took down Elizabeth Warren's ad. Did--are her ads put back up the way you put back up Senator Blackburn's? </p><p>POTTS: Yes, ranking member, we did incorrectly remove Senator Warren's ad. Once we recognized that we did and recognizing that, A, Senator Warren, both as a senator and presidential candidate, is much in the public discourse, that her ad also was in the public discourse. We removed it for a--for a trademark reason. But once we recognized that--what was being discussed within the ad, we reinstated it. </p><p>HIRONO: Well, here's something that I think really is a concern for--for those of us who care about discrimination on your platform, Mr. Potts. So, let's move from bias to outright discrimination. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recently announced that it was charging Facebook with violating the Fair Housing Act by encouraging, enabling, and causing housing discrimination through the company's advertising platform. </p><p>Facebook is charged with enabling advertisers to exclude people based upon their neighborhood by drawing a red line around those neighborhoods on a map. So, unlike claims of anti-conservative bias, these are serious allegations of conduct that inflicts real harm on Americans. Does Facebook now or did Facebook ever enable advertisers to exclude people based on their neighborhood by drawing a red line around those neighborhoods on a map? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, I'm unfamiliar with a red line, but I would like to say that our policies, our advertising policies prevent wrongful discrimination especially in the context of housing or employment or credit around ZIP codes, around age, around gender. In fact, we've reached a historic settlement with a few of the leading civil rights organizations, the National Fair Housing Alliance as well as the ACLU, recently. </p><p>The HUD complaint or the HUD investigation and now lawsuit came as a surprise. We had a lot of meaningful conversations, so we thought we were working to work through their issues. And then we were, just frankly, surprised that they went--they moved forward with the suit. </p><p>HIRONO: Well, I would think that HUD has, I hope, some kind of a basis for what they charged with--you with. So, you've done what? You've reviewed your platforms, your algorithms, to make sure that discriminatory advertising is not permitted on your platform? </p><p>POTTS: That is correct. For wrongful discrimination of advertising, we prohibited--we prohibit our advertisers from engaging in that behavior. And we're--when we are made aware, we do limit or restrict their access to advertising. These are constant conversations. We're continually improving our policies where there may--where they may fall short. But we do prohibit discrimination within the platform. </p><p>HIRONO: So, is Facebook engaging in negotiations with the HUD over this allegation, or have they filed a--a lawsuit? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, I believe HUD has filed a lawsuit. I am not a lawyer that works on this or a lawyer for the company, for that matter. So, I can't speak to those issues, but happy to find--follow up. </p><p>HIRONO: I'd be interested to know if--if Facebook is trying to get the lawsuit dismissed based on what you told us, but we shall see. Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Senator Hirono. And I'll note that Senator Hirono referenced Elizabeth Warren. Senator Warren, I--I invited her to testify at this hearing along with Senator Blackburn. Senator Warren informed us that her schedule did not allow her to do so, but I'll note that Senator Warren tweeted the following. </p><p>\"Curious why I think Facebook has too much power? Let's start with their ability to shut down debate over whether Facebook has too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts, but I want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single sensor, hashtag break up big tech.\" And I will tell you, in response to that tweet for the first time ever in my life, I retweeted Senator Elizabeth Warren. </p><p>Senator Lee? </p><p>LEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to respond to a suggestion that was made a moment ago by one of my colleagues to the effect that there is harm on both sides, to the effect that, if I understood the comment correctly, sometimes the discrimination against ideas on social media networks cut one way politically and sometimes they cut the other way politically. </p><p>That may be true as far as those words go in and of themselves. But it's a blatant mischaracterization of anyone's perception of the way these social media networks operate. As I understand our two witnesses today, they are not disputing the fact that there is a problem. Now, it may be just a problem of corporate culture within their respective companies, but there is a problem. There is rather blatant bias in one direction politically. </p><p>I mean, we saw it just a few minutes ago in my interaction with Mr. Potts. You know, an image of a baby, when used by a Susan B. Anthony advertisement, gets taken down, and it doesn't get taken down when a comparable image of a baby in a hospital, even the baby that's premature and undergoing medical treatment, doesn't get taken down. </p><p>It's not lost on any of us that this cuts overwhelmingly one direction and not the other. That doesn't mean we can't identify aberrational examples, examples of where it cuts the other direction. But I--I don't hear either one of you disputing or making any attempt to refute the idea that we do have a political bias issue here. </p><p>That doesn't mean necessarily that it's--the government's issued a resolve. It doesn't mean that we own your companies and can tell you what to do. But insofar as you would have your users suggest and believe that you are somehow a politically neutral forum, that's laughable. No one assumes that to be true, and I don't hear you saying that. </p><p>Mr. Monje, I'd like to start with you. I'd heard you mention something a few minutes ago in reference to questions from the chairman about the statement by Jack Dorsey. The statement was I don't believe that we can afford to take a natural--a neutral stance anymore. I don't believe we should optimize for neutrality. You gave context for that quote, and I don't have the written version of that in front of me. Can you give me the context for that again? </p><p>MONJE: I appreciate it very much, sir. What he was distinguishing was the two words, neutrality versus impartiality, and that we were aiming for impartiality, which is more action focused as opposed to more passive in neutrality. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, I'm not sure I understand the distinction for purposes of our discussion today. Can--can you help me understand why that makes any difference for the problem we're--we're identifying? </p><p>MONJE: That we work extremely hard and the people that come to Twitter every day work extremely hard to make sure that people on all sides of every debate, and three quarters of our users are overseas, have the opportunity to talk about what it is they care about and not have the platform be the subject of the--of the discussion. That takes a lot of effort, creating a safe environment where people aren't facing threats of violence or threats of rape, child sex exploitation. These are--these are--it takes active effort, and that's what Jack-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah-- </p><p>MONJE: --Was talking about. </p><p>LEE: And I understand that. I--I appreciate that. I--I don't hear you refuting the notion that there is some bias within the company politically. </p><p>By the way, how would you characterize your corporate culture as it relates to the political world? Would--would you characterize it as particularly conservative? </p><p>MONJE: I would politely disagree with the premise of your question and say that I disagree with--with what you're saying. It's that we work every day to make sure that--that our platform is impartial and that everybody can come to it to speak. And people don't come to Twitter to work because of, you know, they're on one side of one issue or the other. Whether we're-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah, and I--I haven't suggested that, and I resent your suggestion that I'm suggesting it. </p><p>MONJE: Well, I'm sorry. </p><p>LEE: Are you suggesting to me, sir, that your--your workforce and the--and the people who monitor the content of what's posted on Twitter-- </p><p>MONJE: --I'm-- </p><p>LEE: --Are equally Republican and Democratic? Surely you're not suggesting that. </p><p>MONJE: I--I'm sorry if I offended you. I don't understand how I did. I'm--I'm telling you that we have a global audience. We have a global workforce. And they come to Twitter to build a platform where people can find out what's happening in the world and talk about what's happening in the world. And it is in--it is in our interest as a company, it is in our interest as our advertiser, to have eyeballs that--that care about all these issues. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, not my question. My--my question, with respect, sir, is about your workforce. Do you think your workforce has the ability to engage in self-reflection, in meaningful self-criticism, with regard to whether or not it's filtering content in a politically neutral manner? </p><p>MONJE: I think that is an excellent question. I think Senator Sasse mentioned something earlier that I go back to, which is if we were running a--a--a sandwich shop, it's likening it to have a board--a comment board at the front that allowed anybody to say the ham sandwiches here are terrible. The--the tuna sandwiches are terrible. And that's what Twitter allows, is a platform that not--not only allows people on all sides of the debate, but also to criticize us. </p><p>We found out about Senator Hollings letter to us because he tweeted it. That's--that's the kind of open environment that we're trying to build and that every employee comes to Twitter to do. </p><p>LEE: What about the kind of environment that allows someone to say abortion is terrible or abortion is a fundamental right? Is that equally important? </p><p>MONJE: Those--those conversations happen on Twitter every day. </p><p>LEE: They do. And are you suggesting that they are treated in an ambidextrous fashion? </p><p>MONJE: We strive to do that every day, yes, sir. </p><p>LEE: You strive to do that. What about you, Mr. Potts? How would you describe your corporate culture within Facebook? </p><p>POTTS: Thank you, senator. There was one thing that you said that I--I agree that we have political bias. I want to be very clear. I have said a few times in this hearing that I don't think we have political bias. I do not think we have political bias. I do not think we have a strong issue against marginalized communities either. </p><p>That--what I did say is that there is the room for unconscious bias that we do not recognize, and that is why we are doing those assessments. But again, I want to just be--for extreme clarity, I do not believe that we have this issue, and so I don't think that that bias exists at Facebook. </p><p>Now, to the question of corporate culture, I think within our--within our Bay Area-based office, it probably does--we would probably have more liberal or people who identify as Democrats then we do as Republicans. We are a global company. We have a large presence in--in Texas. We have a large presence here in D.C. as well as New York. We have a large presence in Dublin. We have a large presence in Singapore. So, we are a global company, and I would--I am not the correct person to ask what everyone's political ideology is, because we don't do a survey on that either. </p><p>LEE: And--and I don't--I don't mean to suggest that you should, and I would find that thought horrifying, that we as a Congress would ever suggest that you should. </p><p>But since we're having a conversation about whether or not you're able to operate a forum that is at least perceived as having a certain degree of objectivity and neutrality, and since we've established, I think, that in many circumstances you end up with disparate treatment of very, very similar images--look, this is unmistakable and it's--insofar as you're suggesting that this doesn't produce very different outcomes on the right from the outcomes that are achieved on the left, that is laughable. </p><p>And so, I'm--I'm asking you, are we crazy in perceiving this? Are--are we wrong, or--or is--could there possibly be something about your procedures that are not capable of--of monitoring and maintaining a politically neutral forum for discussion? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, again, we are a platform for diversity of viewpoints. Your question about the disparate impact of our policies as they apply to any group, whether that be conservative, whether that be a marginalized group, and how those policies are actually enforced and that it produces a--an outcome that is unintended is something that we take very seriously. </p><p>We do some research. We're trying to do more research. But that's also why we have hired, engaged Senator Kyl, Laura Murphy, to see--to collect these anecdotes, to hear these-- </p><p>LEE: --Well, that's great. But I--but I heard you say a few minutes ago-- </p><p>POTTS: --Yeah-- </p><p>LEE: --You're going to have Senator Kyl go and talk to conservative groups. That's great. I--I really don't know what that's supposed to do. Having Senator Kyl interact with other conservatives, I--I don't know what that does for Facebook. I don't know what that should do for anyone who is concerned about whether or not this is able to operate as a platform that presents itself to the world with a degree of neutrality. </p><p>POTTS: I--I am not a--a constitutional scholar, so I can't speak-- </p><p>LEE: --This doesn't require-- </p><p>POTTS: --Right. Sir-- </p><p>LEE: --This is not even about the Constitution. I'm just asking about the political neutrality of Facebook as it's perceived by the world. There is no constitutional issue here. </p><p>POTTS: That is fair, senator. I was going to--to really try to go back to the disparate impact of rules. And I think part of that, in the study you need to hear those anecdotes to collect the information, the data, to actually see--to find which policies that may be right for review, to see if those are actually violated. </p><p>So, I don't know how you get to--you can't really review the policy without hearing where you think it's being misapplied, if that--it makes sense. That's the way I interpret it. Now, I'm not--again, I'm not the one carrying out the review, so I don't know how their methodology is going. But if I was to run the review, I would need to collect the data of where we thought the policy was misapplied, where it is having that impact. Then I would look to the policy to say, okay, how did you write this? What is the intended, and then how is it being enforced? That's--that's how I would go about it. </p><p>Now, Senator Kyl, Laura Murphy, they have their own processes. They have their own ways of going about it, so I can't speak to them. But that's kind of the first point where I would start to. So, I would go out and collect those anecdotes, collect where I think, okay, is it the case that we over enforce on pro-choice content, or is it the case that we over enforce on pro-life content, bring that back and see what policies apply, and then work through the process to say you know what? You actually do over enforce in this area. Why is that? And then you can find--I think you'll find answers. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. Look, there are no easy solutions here, and I--I don't mean to suggest by any of this that I--that I envy your position or that I think this is an easy thing. But I--I will suggest that if I were to run a social media--a global social media network, we'll call it Cruz Book, from my hometown of Alpine, Utah, and I were to staff it entirely from people--with people from Alpine, Utah who share my political worldview more than people outside of my hometown of Alpine, Utah, it would probably produce a different discussion than what you have with a company that's overwhelmingly run by people with a very different political worldview and political philosophy than I do. </p><p>And I would--you didn't ask for it, but I--I would respectfully suggest that that's one of the things you ought to be looking to. It's great that you got Senator Kyl talking to conservative groups. I think that's fantastic. I don't think that's going to change anything as long as your corporate culture remains as it is, overwhelmingly to one side. That is entirely your prerogative as a company if you want to do that. But I don't know that that's necessarily where you want to be or how you're portraying yourself to the world. </p><p>Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRUZ: Well, and I look forward to utilizing Senator Lee's upcoming social media network. I--I will note, by the way, both of y'all pressed back on saying you--you don't know the political leanings of your employees. The Facebook CEO, Mr. Zuckerberg, when he testified here in his own words characterized Silicon Valley as \"an extremely left-leaning place.\" And so, I think anyone is denying reality to--to suggest otherwise. </p><p>Senator Blumenthal? </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just for the record, you don't take surveys or polls among your employees as to what they believe about any given political issues, do you? </p><p>POTTS: No, senator. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Monje? </p><p>MONJE: No, sir. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And so, your views are intuitive guesses. Is that more or less correct? </p><p>POTTS: I believe that's correct, senator, just based off our location. But again, we do not take surveys. It's not data accurate. I would not hold it out to be true. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Same for you, Mr. Monje? </p><p>MONJE: Yes, sir. We don't survey people. Most of my--the entire government relations team is--is behind me here. And we've got Republicans and Democrats, and we argue about SEC football more than anything else. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And--and I think we are experienced enough in the world of media, newspaper, and other kind of coverage to know that bias and leanings are very much in the eye of the beholder. When we see a story that mentions us favorably, we think it's great. When it takes aim at us, many of us take umbrage. </p><p>And so, the--the kind of views that have been elicited here, and maybe of Mark Zuckerberg as well, and about Silicon Valley are very much emotional, non-fact-based, nonscientific reactions. And in fact, compared to other parts of the country, Silicon Valley may not be all that left-leaning. Would you agree? </p><p>POTTS: That's an interesting question, senator. I--I've--no, I have not done a survey of Silicon Valley. I see a lot of Democrats. I think there are a lot of libertarians as well. And I'm sure there are a lot of--I live much further East Bay than others, and I have a lot of Republican and conservative neighbors. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: A good question to an--a good answer to an unfair question. </p><p>So, let me just move on to say--as I ask this question, I should disclose that my son, Matthew Blumenthal, is a trial lawyer in Bridgeport with a firm named Koskoff Koskoff &amp; Bieder that represents Robbie Parker, who also happens to be one of my constituents. He represents Mr. Parker in an action involving threats and harassment against him and others who lost children at Sandy Hook. </p><p>Robbie Parker is going to be testifying, assuming we are done with this panel in time. And he, along with many other Sandy Hook families, reported specific harmful content published on Facebook that subjected them to online and off-line harassment. I have no connection other than through my son with that litigation, but I disclose it in the interests of simply indicating what--what personal involvement I may have. </p><p>In Mr. Parker's written testimony, he mentions that these families made years of requests of Facebook to remove that harmful content, years of requests. Only recently, once this content became publicized, commonly known, and the subject of press attention, in fact, has Facebook reacted to these reports and begun to remove it. Facebook's delay facilitated the nationwide spread of this threatening and harassing content, which resulted in serious and lasting harm to my constituents. That is a fact that, indeed, will be proven in court at some point. </p><p>When I learned about this harassment, which was quite some time ago, my heart broke for these families. This kind of harassment, threats, and other extraordinarily repugnant content had lasting damage for many of these families. We don't know for sure, but it may have also played a part in the suicide most recently of the dad of one of those children, Avielle Richman. Jeremy Richman killed himself just a few weeks ago. </p><p>So, this kind of repulsive content has real-life consequences. And I would like to know, Mr. Potts, when someone like Mr. Parker reports that he is being harassed, what steps are taken by Facebook to review that content? </p><p>POTTS: Thank you, senator. And again, I'll take a pause. My--my heart goes out to those--the victims. It goes out to Mr. Parker. As a father of three with two school-age children who are roughly the age of the victims in Sandy Hook, as well as a wife who is a schoolteacher, I--it's--it's--it's a bit rough. So, I can only imagine the--the harassment that he felt that--online and experienced. My heart goes out to him. </p><p>When someone reports content to us, we do remove it--we do review it under our community standards. We review it for a--all violations, whether they are credible threats of violence, whether they are bullying, whether they are harassment. And if it satisfies those community standards, we remove it. </p><p>As you've noted, we have now a policy that prevents the harassment of the survivors of violent tragedies. Comments that would target the victims of violent tragedies, as in the case of the children, if there are comments where someone targets them and calls them a crisis actor or says that the event has not happened, we would remove that content. We remove it swiftly. </p><p>To the point, senator, we--we try to move as quickly as possible. And perhaps in this case, we did not move fast enough. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: How long does it generally take now for Facebook to contact that person or that entity to remove the harmful content? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, we try to turn that content around. I'd just say our operating time to remove that content is--roughly 24 hours is kind of the expected timeframe, but it's often much, much faster than that. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And what do you do to stop it from spreading in the meantime? </p><p>POTTS: If we find--for that type of content, especially around what you are naming, this type of viral content, if we know of things like hashtags, which are becoming more and more prominent, obviously prominent on Twitter, places like Instagram as well, we do try to limit discoverability, reducing that--those types of comments and hashtags in our search products so you cannot aggregate, especially on Instagram, those types of--that type of content, I should say, that would target somebody on the basis of them being a victim of a violent tragedy. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And you--you know you have a set of protections under Section 230 that afford you a high degree of in effect immunity or shield from liability for the content that appears on your platforms. But I really think you have a responsibility, it may not be a legal responsibility, but a moral responsibility, to protect people like Mr. Parker. And he's just one example of the Sandy Hook families, and they are just a few examples of the victims--ongoing victims of this kind of harassment. </p><p>What can you do to deter this kind of harassing and threatening message that is so disruptive and destructive to people's lives? </p><p>POTTS: Senator, thank you. We do have 30,000 people who now focus on safety and security, and many of those focus on this type of behavior. It is doing--it is ensuring that we are responsive to reports. It is when we can proactively surface these things through the use of our artificial intelligence and machine learning, getting it before reviewers so they can remove it before it is even reported by a user. And of course if we have repeated bad actors, to remove not only their content, but if they are egregious we will also remove their profiles. There are a few people who I would say trade in this type of behavior, and we have removed their pages that--for repeated violations of our hate speech policy, the policies that apply to this type of harassment, as well. And we just need to continue to refine our policies, ensure we're faster, ensure the processes are strong, continue to work. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: I understand you have audits underway, both Twitter and Facebook have audits underway, correct? </p><p>POTTS: For Facebook that is correct, senator. We have assessments by Senator Kyl, as well as Laura Murphy doing a civil rights assessment. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And that's true of Twitter, as well, I believe, correct? Mr. Dorsey has (INAUDIBLE) made those audits known? </p><p>MONJE: We've done a study to get ready for this hearing and other hearings that talk about the impact of how tweets from members of Congress reach their users. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Will you commit to making public the audits that you are doing? </p><p>MONJE: Yes, sir. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Potts? </p><p>POTTS: Our civil rights audit is currently public now. We've issued the first--the first report in January. That is ongoing. Senator Kyl's assessment is still ongoing. I'm not sure of the status of that, but if we make it public, we will definitely share with you, sir. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: If you make it public you will definitely share it with us. Will you commit to making it--maybe I misheard you; I'm sorry. </p><p>POTTS: No, I think you did hear me correctly. I don't know the status of it in the--whether we were committed to making that public, but I will definitely find out, and I will come back to you. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: If you could let us know, I'd appreciate it. </p><p>POTTS: Will do. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, and let me emphatically agree with Senator Blumenthal's comments, both that the audits of both companies should be made public, but also that those spreading vile lies about the Sandy Hook families are reprehensible, and I would note that if Congress were to repeal Section 230 of the CDA, that Facebook, and Twitter, and Google would face liability for slander and libel, which would have resulted in those malicious lies being pulled down much, much earlier, just like every other media publication is liable for slander and libel. </p><p>With that, we're going to move to the second panel. Before we do that, I do want to enter into the record two different documents. The first is an op-ed by Kay Coles James who is the president of the Heritage Foundation, and that op-ed ran today, in today's Washington Post. Ms. James was named to an ethics advisory council by Google, and some 2,500 employees of Google signed a petition to have her removed from that panel, and indeed those over 2,500 Google employees said about Ms. James, by appointing Kay Cole James to the advisory council. Google elevates and endorses her views, implying that hers is a valid perspective worthy of inclusion in its decision-making. This is unacceptable. Ms. James' op-ed is a powerful response to it that, among other things, observes that she is a, quote, 69-year-old black woman who grew up fighting segregation. And it illustrates a very extreme view to consider the president of the Heritage Foundation someone whose views are--are not--whose perspectives are not worthy of inclusion. So without objection, I want to enter her op-ed into the record. And secondly, is an article today by Brendan Carr in the National Review entitled Facebook Forgets the First Amendment, and it highlights how CEO, Mark Zuckerberg's recent call for more government regulation of speech is a call for a censorship regime that would violate Americans' fundamental rights. And without objection, both will be entered into the record. </p><p>Senators, we will keep the record open for two weeks from today. Senators are asked to submit any questions to the witnesses in writing, and the witnesses are asked to respond to those questions as soon as possible. And with that, I will thank both of you for being here at this hearing and would call forward the second panel. </p><p>I'll now introduce our witnesses on the second panel. The first witness is Mr. Chuck Konzelman. Chuck Konzelman is a writer and director who is focused on films with a Christian message. Most recently he wrote and directed the movie, Unplanned, the true story of one woman's journey from being one of the youngest Planned Parenthood clinic directors in the nation to becoming a pro-life advocate. And I have to say having seen the film myself, it is extraordinarily powerful. I would encourage everyone, regardless of where you fall on the abortion debate, to watch this film and--and--and confront the powerful and true story that it relays. </p><p>Mr. Konzelman has a long and successful career in the secular entertainment industry. He has worked with Warner Bros., Paramount, Sony Columbia and 20th Century Fox and sold original concept TV pilots to CBS, ABC and Fox. In 2008 he and his friend, Cary Solomon, decided to embark on a new path. Moved by their faith, they left the secular entertainment field and began working on films promoting a Christian message, including God's Not Dead, another wonderful film, and Do You Believe. Mr. Konzelman is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame. </p><p>Our second witness is Dr. Francesca Tripodi--I hope I pronounced that close to correctly--who is an assistant professor of sociology at James Madison University and an affiliated researcher at Data &amp; Society. Dr. Tripodi's research focuses on how partisan groups interact with media and the role community plays in understanding what constitutes news and information. Dr. Tripodi received her PhD from the University of Virginia. Congratulations on the national championship, however traumatic it was for everyone in Texas. She received her MA in sociology from the University of Virginia, as well, an MA in communications, culture and technology from Georgetown University and her BA in communications from the University of Southern California. </p><p>The next witness is the Honorable Marilyn Musgrave. She is a former congresswoman and is vice president of government affairs at the Susan B. Anthony List, an organization that seeks to reduce and ultimately end abortion in the United States. Congresswoman Musgrave joined the Susan B. Anthony List after a distinguished career in public service. She served three terms in the United States House of Representatives, representing Colorado's fourth district, and before that she was a two-term member of the Colorado House of Representatives and a member of the Fort Morgan school board. Before seeking elected office herself, she was a hard-charging volunteer for the campaigns of numerous conservative candidates as well as president of her local Right to Life chapter. She is a graduate of Colorado State University. </p><p>Mr. Robbie Parker. Mr. Robbie Parker is the husband of Alissa Parker and the father of three girls, Madeline, Samantha and Emilie. Emilie was one of the young children tragically killed in the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school in December 2012. Since the shooting, Mr. Parker and his family have been the targets of online conspiracy theorists who falsely and maliciously assert that he is a crisis actor and that the Sandy shooting was a hoax. Welcome, sir. </p><p>Professor Eugene Kontorovich is our final witness. Professor Kontorovich is a professor of law at the Scalia Law School at George Mason University. He is an expert in multiple different fields of law, including constitutional law, universal jurisdiction and international law, and he has written extensively on First Amendment issues in a variety of context. He has published over 30 major scholarly articles and book chapters in leading law reviews and peer-reviewed journals in both the United States and Europe. He has also written numerous essays, op-eds, white papers, reviews and blog posts addressing some of the most complex legal issues of the day. Although Professor Kontorovich began his academic career at George Mason Scalia Law School, is now a full professor there, in between he spent two years at the University of Chicago Law School and over a decade at Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law. He attended the University of Chicago for college and law school and clerked for Judge Richard Posner on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. </p><p>With that, I will ask each of the witnesses to stand and raise your right hand. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? </p><p>UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>Mr. Konzelman, you may begin. </p><p>KONZELMAN: Senator Cruz, members of the committee, I appear here today with my lifelong friend and business partner, Cary Solomon, who is my cowriter, codirector, coproducer of the film, Unplanned, which is the true life story of Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood surgical abortion clinic director, who after seeing an abortion take place in real time on a sonogram screen, the image created via the ultrasound probe that Abby herself was holding, turned her entire worldview upside down and became a pro-life advocate. That film is playing in theaters nationwide as we speak. </p><p>From the outset making a pro-life film in a pro-choice town, Los Angeles, we knew we would face a number of challenges. Moving past the challenges of production and postproduction and limiting my comments to the marketing campaign, please allow me to highlight some of those. The MPAA saddled us with an R rating, which strongly discourages much of the Christian audience and all of the Church of Latter Day Saints from seeing our film since they have a general prohibition against seeing R-rated films. It also precluded us from using the single most effective form of motion picture advertising, paid placement of our theatrical trailer before other films in theaters. But with an R rating we were prohibited from advertising before anything other than other R-rated films without special permission, which we sought and were denied. </p><p>We also looked to advertise on cable television, but with the exception of Fox News and CBN, we were systematically denied access to the outlets where we sought to advertise, among which were Lifetime, UPtv, Hallmark, HGTV, USA Network, Food Network, the Travel Channel, DIY and the Cooking channel. Lifetime, which is owned by A&amp;E Network, a joint venture of Walt Disney and Hearst Communications, told our buyers that they were refusing due to the, quote, sensitive nature of the film, unquote, but it previously promoted an interview with Scarlett Johansson in which she touted the benefits of Planned Parenthood. We consider these blanket refusals highly unusual and highly discriminatory and are formally petitioning the FCC to look further into the matter. </p><p>In this environment we rather naturally looked to go to social media with our advertising spend. But once again, we found ourselves stymied. Google Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords, blocked the integrity of the Unplanned pre-release banner ads, which I should probably point out consisted of a woman, half of her face with a tear coming down, and the words saying what she saw changed everything. I don't think they were particularly offensive. </p><p>For the effectiveness of Google advertising, we will quote Google itself. When you advertise with--when you advertise on the Google display network, which has over two million sites and reaches over 90 percent of the people on the internet, your ads can appear across a large collection of websites, mobile apps and video content. There the quote ends. We were convinced at the advisability of advertising with Google, but we were blocked from doing so. Google cited a policy regarding abortion-related ads. Just one problem; we weren't doing abortion-related ads. We were marketing a movie. It's important to note that this prohibition was solidly in place for the entire lead up to our theatrical release. Why is this important? Because much like advertising spend in a political campaign, the vast majority of dollars spent in promoting a film are spent to help build up a white-hot intensity and awareness around one particular date, but instead of election night, for films it's Friday night of opening weekend because that all-important opening weekend's results determine the course of the film's theatrical run and even how much it will make in ancillary markets and overseas. </p><p>And after the film's release, Google came up with yet another restriction concerning event ticket sales, one which our film's marketers had never come across or even heard of in multiple similar campaigns. In short, we firmly believe that they were sharpshooting us, hiding behind highly selective and discriminatory enforcement of their own guidelines. It's impossible for me to quantify the damage done by Google's refusal, but it's absurd to think that there wasn't damage done. But we weren't finished with social media woes. Within hours of our theatrical debut, in the early morning hours of Saturday, March 30, the film's Twitter account, technically the account owned by the film's single purpose marketing entity, was suspend--suspended. The reason for that suspension has not, to the best of my knowledge, been made clear beyond being accidental or a mistake. However, when such accidents occur within 12 hours of the film's theatrical debut, and after what I understand was nine months of ownership during which time there were zero suspensions, the glitch becomes suspect. </p><p>The uproar came quickly and was loud. Apparently a number of media personalities, including Shannon Bream of Fox News, conservative commentator, Dana Loesch, and television personality and pro-life supporter, Patricia Heaton, were aware of the situation and made it known from their own social media platforms. If any progressive or left-leaning pundits or influencers came to our support on the basis of principle, we are unaware of it. </p><p>Within two hours after the suspension, service was restored, although it's also my understanding that our posting of a Twitter announcement with words to the effect of we're back, was deleted from the account without explanation. Later on the same day Twitter apparently deleted the vast majority of those listed as followers on our account, reducing the number from something on the order of 200,000 to less than 200, 1000 to 1 reduction in our listed followers, and numerous people, including the subject of our film, Abby Johnson, and the star of our film, Ashley Bratcher, found themselves unable to read or follow their own movie on Twitter. Dana Loesch's tweet of 11:21 p.m. on the same day read, and here I quote, about five minutes ago I was following @unplannedmovie, and then I just checked it after seeing so many say they had trouble even following the account, and somehow I wasn't following them anymore. The quote ends here. </p><p>Again, this was during our all-important first weekend of release, begging the question, why does this always seem to happen to conservatives? Or as the overtly satirical website, The Babylon Bee put it, quote, meanwhile, Planned Parenthood, an organization that actually kills babies every single day, still had an active Twitter account in good standing, unquote. Interestingly, on the one social media platform from today's panel where we didn't have any significant problems, on Facebook, our exposure exploded, and I believe the film's Facebook site had something on the order of about 12 million trailer views by the time of our theatrical debut and nearly 18 million to date. We credit this unrestricted access with much of the film's success, only highlighting the importance of access to social media. </p><p>For the record, we alleged no collusion between any of the social media or cable entities, at least not in the formal sense. They require no coordinated communication or agreement between them because they are unanimously progressive in their orientation, political beliefs and world view, and likewise strongly predisposed towards stifling conservative thought. </p><p>But as evidence that this discrimination is one-sided, I posit this question to the committee. There are a number of pro-choice films currently in development in Hollywood. I will mention two. Let Her Speak, the story of Wendy Davis's pro-choice filibuster on the floor of the Texas Senate, to which Sandra Bullock is attached to star, and This is Jane, being produced by Amazon Prime, which tells the story of an underground abortion provider network in pre-Roe versus Wade Chicago. Is there any member of this committee would like to go on record as saying they honestly expect that either of those films will have trouble in buying advertising on Google or otherwise? I think not because they won't, unless perhaps this committee elects to remember and closely examine whether standards are applied evenly, and lest anyone be tempted to dismiss our film as some sort of right-wing rant or conservative propaganda. </p><p>I will quote from the final lines of an article by Marc Thiessen of the Washington Post and reprinted in the New York Post, neither of which are generally regarded as bastions of conservative thought. Here I quote, ultimately the movie is a testament to the power of prayer. Abby's family prays for her to leave Planned Parenthood, but they never reject her. They know she is a good person who does not yet understand the evil of abortion. There are millions like her. The film's goal is to reach them by showing us the humanity of the unborn child. This is why abortion supporters don't want you to see Unplanned. See it anyway. The quote ends here. That is a Washington Post journalist's description of the movie that social media went out of its way to restrict public awareness of. </p><p>In closing, if social media is allowed to presumptively and preemptively dismiss conservative thought as controversial, divisive, or too sensitive, then that is what it will continue to do. If they are allowed to apply their own broadly drawn guidelines to dismiss one side of controversial issues, the side they don't agree with and do so with impunity, then they will do so. It's all too easy to label conservative thought as controversial or divisive, dismiss it as contrary to their guidelines or roll out the dreaded phrase, hate speech. But in a digital age, exclusion from the digital arena isn't just discriminatory. It's the most insidiously effective form of censorship available or imaginable. Senator Cruz and the Judiciary Committee members, thank you for your attention. It's been an honor for Cary Solomon and myself to be here, and we hope to be able to answer any questions you may have. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Konzelman. Dr. Tripodi. </p><p>TRIPODI: Before I get started, I want to thank everyone for their opportunity to let me speak on my research behalf. I'm a professor of sociology at James Madison University, and for the last decade I have conducted international and domestic research on the interplay between technology and society. In my testimony today I will argue three points. Search engines are primarily shaped by the keywords that we enter. Second, that conservative content creators excel at search engine and social media optimization. And third, that conspiracy theories thrive when legitimate content is absent. </p><p>Google, including its subsidiary, YouTube, is the most powerful search engine in the world. It works by scanning the entire internet to find webpages and other content that best match the keywords entered. The system reads in metadata, which is really just a fancy term for tags that are written into the content to help make it searchable. We think of algorithms as magic, but what's happening is very simple. Google transforms our input into a value. Most of the accusations about silencing are focused on output, but what my research reveals is that our results are more likely shaped by input, the keywords that we enter into the search bar. Take for example two very similar searches surrounding an advertisement paid for by Americans for Prosperity during the Virginia governor's race. The ad argued that the Democratic candidate was incompetent because he had approved the spending of $1.4 million in taxpayer money to a fake Chinese company. If you Googled Northam fake Chinese company on January 25, 2018, you were provided with both a conservative take on how Northam was scammed, as well as information from factcheck.org assessing the legitimacy of the claims. </p><p>However, focusing on fiscal responsibility, and including the phrase 1.4 million, returned dramatically different exclusively conservative content. This was an opinion piece by the Republican Governors Association, an op-ed by a conservative politician and links directing users back to Americans for Prosperity. This is also true when you consider the phrase, Russia collusion. In May of last year Google actually auto filled the search to include the phrase delusion. And as of this week, when you key in Russian collusion delusion, a majority of the returns support the conservative perspective that allegations against Trump were unsubstantiated. If one were inclined to believe that the assertion of conservatism is being silenced and search for more info about conservative censorship, you will find that Google does not attempt to repress the accusations, but instead returns a series of links and videos that affirm the threat is real. </p><p>Marketers use search engine optimization to try and maximize the likelihood that Google will return links back to their cause or company. It is clear that conservative production companies have an acute understanding of how this works. For example, if you analyze the metadata of Prager U videos on YouTube, the company tags just as many of their videos as Democrat as they do Republican. They tag more of their videos with feminism or the women's march than with the word conservative. This strategy increases the likelihood that their videos will appear when people search for or engage with a range of ideological concepts. For example, the top result on YouTube when you search the phrase social justice is a Prager U video that currently has over 1.1 million views. So contrary to the claim that conservatism is being silenced, these marketing tactics amplify conservative positions to audiences who might even be searching for information on more liberal leaning topics. </p><p>When there is limited or no metadata matching a particular topic, it is easy to coordinate around keywords to guarantee the kind of information Google will return. This is how conspiracy theorists were able to capitalize on the phrase crisis actor. By producing a plethora of insidious content and maximizing search engine optimization, they filled the data void with their own ideas. Conservative content creators also latch onto data voids in order to optimize their positions. For example, when you search the name Nellie Ohr, the only links returned are from conservative leaning sources. Nellie Ohr on YouTube produces nothing but conservative news content and conspiratorial videos. </p><p>As you can see, depending on what you search, conservatism thrives online. The greater problem here is that we live in parallel internets based on our distinct worldviews. We think of Google as a window into the wider world, but it's more like a mirror, reflecting our own interests and biases back to us. To be sure, we must take seriously the fact that YouTube, Facebook and Twitter play an increasingly important role in how our society gains access to news and information. Unfortunately, the opaqueness of their operational tactics allow unsubstantiated conspiracies to hold weight. Thank you very much for your time. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Dr. Tripodi. Congresswoman Musgrave. </p><p>MUSGRAVE: Good afternoon, Chairman Cruz and Ranking Member Hirono. Thank you very much for the opportunity to testify on this vitally important matter. Susan B. Anthony List is a nationwide network of more than 700,000 Americans. Our mission is to end abortion by electing national leaders and advocating for laws that save lives. We invest heavily in voter education to ensure that pro-life Americans know where their lawmakers stand on protecting the unborn. We engage in issue advocacy, advancing pro-life laws through direct lobbying and grassroots campaigns. </p><p>Social media communications are essential to advancing that mission. More than two billion people worldwide and nearly 80 percent of the United States population use social media. If we do not have a strong presence online and the ability to reach our target audience, we might as well be invisible. Susan B. Anthony List has been fighting censorship of our content for more than two years. On March 8, 2017 SBA List promoted four tweets from our president, Marjorie Dannenfelser. One was immediately rejected with Twitter citing violation of their health and pharmaceutical products and services policy, and already, Mr. Chairman, you have put up that tweet by Mother Teresa. Two more tweets were rejected that very same day. </p><p>On April 12, 2017 SBA List started a Twitter ad campaign urging constituents to ask legislators to pass a healthcare bill that stopped taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion business, which aborts more than 30--332,000 unborn children and receives more than $0.5 billion in taxpayer funding every year. Hours later, Twitter informed us that our account was ineligible to participate in Twitter ads, citing the same policy. No explanation of exactly how SBA List violated the policy was provided even after we inquired. During this same period of time, Planned Parenthood was permitted to run ads very similar to ours. </p><p>In September 2017 Twitter blocked an SBA List video ad advocating John Adams for attorney general of Virginia, stating that it was unacceptable to use the phrase, killing babies, in and ad. Our experience on Facebook has been very similar. Between October 9 and November 1, 2018 Facebook banned seven of our paid ads supporting candidates. Brief images of premature babies born at 20 to 24 weeks, when unborn children can be legally aborted, were deemed sensational or graphic content. These ads have also been referred to, I believe, by Senator Lee earlier. They were the Charlotte and Micah ads, images of little miracle babies fighting for their lives. SBA List appealed, and Facebook apologized, saying the ads should have never been disapproved, but less than two hours later another one of our ads were blocked. We'd be blocked in one state, we'd try to run the ad in another state, and it would be blocked. Perhaps most absurd of all, Facebook and Google blocked our research and educational arm, Charlotte Lozier Institute's video ads featuring patients who are helped by ethical, adult stem cell treatment. </p><p>Google claimed we were trying to sell pharmaceuticals. Many pro-life groups have had their content arbitrarily blocked. YouTube removed an undercover video by the Center for Medical Progress. Twitter, to this day, refuses to allow ads from Live Action citing a policy against inflammatory or provocative content and expects them to scrub content from their own website.  But, Planned Parenthood has recently spent more than $100,000 in Twitter ads. </p><p>Twitter blocked a campaign ad from a representative at the time, Marsha Blackburn, discussing her efforts to stop the sale of baby body parts by Planned Parenthood. And they reversed themselves after a firestorm of criticism. And you've heard that from members of the committee and Senator Blackburn herself. </p><p>The Twitter account for the movie Unplanned was suspended on opening weekend allegedly for being linked to another account that had violated Twitter's rules, then restored. Once or twice could arguably be written off as a mistake, but as our experience shows, and as one writer for the Wall Street Journal pointed out, it's a mistake that keeps on happening over and over. And it demonstrates a pattern of censorship toward the pro-life views specifically. </p><p>Big social media companies wield enormous power to control speech and choose which viewpoints will be favored or disfavored. Facebook's Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg, stated in an interview that, quote, \"When you cut off speech for one person, you cut off speech for other people.\" End quote. We are asking for them to live up to their own professional standards and end the discrimination. </p><p>Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for your efforts to hold them accountable. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Mr. Parker? </p><p>PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and people of the committee for allowing me to be here and speak today. My name is Robbie Parker. I am the father of Emilie Parker, one of 20 students tragically murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. For the last six years I have worked very hard to process the complex emotions that have occupied my heart, mind and soul from the events of that day. </p><p>To give her a hug and a kiss before leaving to work, not knowing that would be the last time I would feel her embrace and hear her voice. Emilie has two younger sisters who were only four and three years old when she was killed. My wife and I have labored diligently to support them as best as we can. </p><p>For those of you who have not had to explain a loss as sudden and as tragic and as brutal as ours to your small and innocent children, let me leave you with no doubt, it is an excruciating, long and arduous process that will continue for the rest of our lives. </p><p>If we had simply lost our daughter due to a disease or a tragic accident that painful process would, perhaps, look very similar. I still would have an experience of her being there in one moment and gone the next. Her sisters would still have to learn to cope with the loss of a beloved sister. My wife and I would still work just as meticulously to help support them on their journey, as well as learn how to grieve as individuals, as a couple and as a family, along with every other unforeseeable hardship that accompanies the dismal abyss of grief. </p><p>However, our story is not that simple. Instead of simply being left to grieve in our home, we are exposed to even more sinister people and motives. Within 48 hours of my daughter's murder, jokesters and conspiracy theorists began spewing lies and hurling threats at me and my family on sites like YouTube, Facebook and other platforms. </p><p>I began to receive messages, emails, letters to my home and phone calls at my work. In short, these communications told me that I was a liar, that justice was coming, that I was going to burn in hell and to watch my back at all times. They claimed that Emilie was still alive or that she never existed, all while accusing me of being a willing accomplice and conspiring with the government to stage or fake this tragedy. </p><p>These people were fueled to act in this way from the information they were consuming on the internet, mainly from content found on social media platforms. Some people even created fake profiles of the shooter with his name and picture and sent me friend requests posing as the shooter himself. I have accepted the fact that I will never know what motivated that individual to enter Sandy Hook that day. </p><p>It takes a certain type of person to walk into a school and carry out what he carried out on those teachers and children. However, it takes a very different kind of person to witness that event, then regurgitate, demonstrably and undeniably false information about that event while simultaneously attacking victims' families for profit. </p><p>I understand that motivation. And I cannot accept it. We reached out to places like YouTube and Facebook pleading for help and asking that this content be removed from their sites. We either received program responses or cold silence. Eventually we had FBI agents in our home to discuss some of the more credible threats logged at me, as well as at my wife and children. </p><p>We've had to consult security experts to help us navigate certain threats and how we should respond appropriately. Ironically, we found that if a post or video displayed a picture YouTube and Facebook would swiftly remove that content for being protected by copyright. However, they were very careful not to infringe on people's freedom of speech. However, in doing so they systematically failed to protect us from harassment and threats and allowed their sites to be used as a genesis and breeding ground for fraudulent and hateful information to be spread, collected and launched, not just at my family, but for the whole world to consume. </p><p>Recently many of these companies have changed course and began to remove some of this content. I don't believe this was done because of the years of request, by not just Sandy Hook families, but many other victims of mass tragedies. Instead, they did so because it became more generally known that such abuse was happening and people were shocked and horrified. Only when it became clear to the general public that social media companies' inactivity and failure to protect families was a result of complacency were they then forced to act. In other words, only when they realized it would tarnish their brand and affect them financially did they finally respond appropriately. </p><p>I hate to think how much time has been stolen from us because of this issue. Instead of grieving, my family was forced to use what precious energy we had to combat these attacks alone. To protect Emilie's memory, ourselves, instead of focusing on our healing. This ordeal has taught me that time with my family is a precious and limited gift. And I wonder in what ways I've let my family down by not being able to give them 100 percent of my time and energy to support them the way that I knew I needed to support them. </p><p>We live in a beautiful country at a beautiful time when we can share our opinions, not just with the people at our dinner table that we know agree with us, but to the whole world. That I can sit on a panel of people who they don't know if agree or disagree with them, but we can have this conversation. Deciding what content is allowed or prohibited on these platforms is paramount in the continuation of our rights to expression. Allowing hateful, false information to proliferate on the internet doesn't just corrupt our national dialogue it has real consequences for real people. </p><p>I believe that social media companies have a duty to moderate content, not to limit, but rather to protect the First Amendment in the way in which it was intended. Thank you. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Parker, for that powerful testimony and thank you for your courage to tell your--your horrific story. </p><p>Professor Kontorovich? </p><p>KONTOROVICH: Chairman Cruz, Ranking Member Hirono, honorable members of the committee, thank you for having me here to testify on the constitutional issues relating to the allege ideological censorship of online content by large internet platforms. I should begin by stating that the extent to which internet platforms engage in politically biased content sorting, the subject of the prior panel, is a factual question in which I can claim no expertise. I will assume for the purpose of the present analysis that such an issue exists to some extent and consider what approaches Congress might take in responding to it. </p><p>So, the first thing to note is that this is not a subject; this is not a First Amendment issue. The First Amendment, of course, applies only to censorship by the government. Indeed, the text of the government speaks only of the federal government. The conduct of private actors is entirely outside the scope of the First Amendment. If anything, ideological content restrictions are editorial decisions that would be protected by the First Amendment. </p><p>Nor can one say that the alleged actions of these companies implicate First Amendment values because analogous to the ones that the First Amendment seems to protect against. The First Amendment, like the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, does not have a penumbra of values beyond which--beyond its text that it protects. Thus, the values of the First Amendment are nothing more than the prohibition of governmental restraints on speech. </p><p>And this point was often obfuscated in a variety of related context. For example, some supporters of net neutrality have recently and incorrectly claimed that net neutrality isn't necessary to protect First Amendment values. </p><p>Okay, but the mere fact that ideologically biased content moderation by tech companies does not raise free speech issues, does not mean that it is not a legitimate matter for public concern and concern by this body and discussion of inquiry by this body. It's certainly reasonable for Congress to take ideologically biased practices by a purportedly neutral internet firms into account when considering updating or revising existing legislation. </p><p>Current regulation is already, as has been mentioned, not neutral on the subject of internet provider--content providers. The Communications Decency Act of 1996 provides special protections for, quote, \"Internet computer--interactive computer services.\" Such companies, under the law, cannot be treated as publishers of content on their sites created by third parties even if they would otherwise qualify as publishers under common law. </p><p>This provision shields the companies from liability for much of the content on their sites on the theory that they are not acting analogous continuous paper editors, that is to say, deciding what to include, what not to include, but rather simply providing a forum or a platform. Now, this blanket presumption, this statutory immunity, is certainly not constitutionally mandated. And it is certainly open to revision in a different environment more than two decades after its passage. </p><p>In enacting the immunity provisions, Congress explicitly assumed that--that protected internet services provide a, quote, \"A forum for a true diversity of political discourse.\" To the extent, and that is, of course, a factual question, that assumption is weakened by content monitoring and modulation practices, the assumptions behind two--Section 230 may need to be revisited. That is to say, to the extent that these platforms are substantively monitoring speech, they do become more like publishers. And then a statutory exemption from treating them like publishers should be reexamined. </p><p>Now, what that--what the result of that reexamination is is an open question. It could mean nothing. For example, limiting their--limiting the immunity under Section 230 would probably result in more filtering and censorship by these companies rather than less. At the same time, it could be another possible outcome would be to broaden this immunity to treat them equivalent to actual publishers. Why should newspaper publishers not get the same benefit? </p><p>A much simpler approach to this solution, which I think avoids lots of--to this problem, which avoids lots of the pitfalls that we have discussed is transparency. And having listened to--to the hearing so far, we've heard that both sides, that is to say, people of all political affiliations, are concerned by content practices and modulation or lack thereof by these companies. It's--the disagreement is in which direction does it cut? </p><p>So, one of the greater strengths and attractions of platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google, is the expectation of users that through the window of their computer they can see or access the vast parade of information out in the world. Users understand the experience of following people as their selection from amongst a myriad of accounts and profiles in the platform what they will follow. Their feed gives them a perspective on outside events. What they may not anticipate is that the online marketplace of ideas that they think they have access to has already been pre-sifted on certain substantive grounds in a way that is not neutral. </p><p>Users that turn to a search engine to discover things about the external world will have a poor understanding of how this search may have been pre-filtered or pre-screened. Because these processes are obscure and yet consumers make assumptions about them, it would be well within the scope of normal principals of transparency and consumer regulation, consumer disclosure, to require companies to make clearer, and, again, I think we've been in this hearing for several hours and it's still unclear to us, for companies to make clearer to consumers what exactly these criteria are. </p><p>Now, drafting serious disclosure rules is, of course, going to be difficult because it's one--it's one thing to say we modulate or we monitor hateful content, of course, that could mean a wide variety of things, and specifying how that is applied is going to be very difficult and the devil is in the details. But, certainly applying normal consumer protection and transparency principals to this context is entirely consistent with the First Amendment. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, professor. </p><p>Mr. Konzelman, let's--let's start with you. What we have heard asserted in this meeting that--that there is no pattern of discrimination of censorship against conservative views or against pro-life views. That assertion seems manifestly contrary to all the available evidence. Although, I would note that--that the social media companies keep much of the evidence in a black box where we're forced to argue by example rather what would be preferable arguing based on the actual data. </p><p>But--but let's focus on your example, because that is one specific and immediate example. The movie Unplanned tells the true story of Abby Johnson. Abby Johnson was the clinic director of the Waco Planned Parenthood Clinic. She was not just briefly a Planned Parenthood employee; she spent, as I understand it, seven years working for Planned Parenthood. She was named employee of the year by Planned Parenthood. </p><p>But, then horrified by the practices she saw at Planned Parenthood, by what she saw happening; she left the abortion industry and has become an outspoken pro-life advocate. I will say when I attended a screening and watched the movie, it was one of the most powerful and moving movies I have ever seen. I thought I was prepared to see the movie and I was not. </p><p>As I understand it, virtually every TV network refused to carry trailers for the movie. Google repeatedly blocked you from advertising the movie. Twitter took your page down, an undisputed fact for which Twitter apologized here today. And not only that, but both Abby Johnson and Ashley Bratcher, the actress who plays Abby Johnson in the movie were prevented from following the Twitter page for the movie. Is all of that correct? Am I understanding the facts correctly? </p><p>KONZELMAN: Yes, so always be the most minor correction, she was actually the clinic director of Bryan, Texas. It was eight years for her whole stint there, from volunteer to clinic director. And I think that's about the only amendments I would--I would make to what you just said. </p><p>CRUZ: And what were the consequences, in particular of Google preventing you from advertising. As you noted, Google itself touts that its advertisements are very effective. What consequences did you face from that--that censorship? </p><p>KONZELMAN: Well, given that there's blanket and kind of systematic censorship, social media was where we turned to. We assumed that we would be allowed to engage in a commercial transaction. Having the money to buy advertising, we assumed we'd be able to buy advertising. And even though certain news organizations have treated us with tremendous journalistic respect, there's--there's a psychological mechanism in the--in the mind of a movie ticket buyer. Until they see some paid advertising they don't really associate that it's--that it is a real movie, and that it's coming out at a particular date. </p><p>And you need to try to create somewhere between--estimates go between eight and 12 impressions. So, we were not able to create those impressions very easily for that market. </p><p>CRUZ: And, as I understand it, despite this almost total social media blackout, although you did give credit to Facebook for not engaging in this practice, and despite this almost total media blackout, the film, nonetheless, in its opening weekend became the number five selling movie in the country despite concerted efforts to prevent moviegoers from hearing about it. </p><p>KONZELMAN: It was actually number four. And when the numbers finally got finalized we thought it was five, it actually jumped to number four when the numbers were finalized. And just so I can give it a relative measure of what I believe the importance of the film is. Before it aired, Michael Farris is the president of the Alliance Defending Freedom had said I believe this is the cultural event that can overturn Roe. Now, that would thrill some and scare others. </p><p>But, I will say that after about 10 days in release, or a couple more now, we have had approaches through Abby Johnson's organization and then there were now. We have--which transitions workers out of the abortion industry. I believe we have something approaching 1 percent of the abortion workers in the United States seeking help to leave the industry. Now, that's based partly on a hard number and partly on an estimate. The number of actual workers who have reached out is 94. I believe there's something on the order of about 700 clinics nationwide. If they all did--had 12 employees, I wasn't a math major, but I think we still get to about one--a little better than 1 percent. </p><p>So, I think on the order of 1 percent of the abortion workers in the United States, after getting one look at them being portrayed on a film and it serves, I think, also some evidence that--that they're not being portrayed as monsters, have decided to change their lives and their profession of what they do for a living. </p><p>CRUZ: That is truly extraordinary and let me commend you. One of the things that I liked best about the film is that it was not a cartoonish portrayal. That it was compassionate and it was compassionate to workers like Abby who were working for Planned Parenthood, although it displayed the--the practices of Planned Parenthood that pressure women into having abortions and sometimes against what they would otherwise wish for. </p><p>KONZELMAN: That was our attempt. Abby was very firm that she wanted this film to be a love letter to those who are still trapped in the industry. </p><p>CRUZ: Congresswoman Musgrave, Susan B. Anthony List, what happened to Unplanned is not isolated. As I understand your testimony, the Susan B. Anthony List has faced repeated censorship, over and over and over again for positive, life affirming, pro-life messages such as the message from Mother Teresa. And so, this is not a one-time accident. This is, in fact, a consistent pattern. Is that correct? </p><p>MUSGRAVE: It is a consistent pattern. And interestingly enough, you know, we alluded to Mother Teresa's quote on--in other instances we've received an apology. And then try to run the same ad in another state and it's taken down. And the fact of the matter is we have target audiences and even a couple of hours can make a dramatic impact on our ability to reach them. We have had ads that have been down for days. The longest an ad has been down is six weeks. But, you can imagine in the heat of a campaign trying to support an issue, how much time that it--it takes away from our staff's ability to do other work. It--it is blatantly unfair when similar ads, for instance, from Planned Parenthood, who receives a half a billion dollars of taxpayers funding a year, has their ads going at the same time our ads are taken down. </p><p>CRUZ: And Congresswoman Musgrave, are you aware of a comparable number of instances or even a single instance of either Planned Parenthood being censored or blocked by Twitter or Facebook or Google or, for that matter, let's take Virginia democratic governor Ralph Northam, who rather horrifically advocated not only late-term abortions, but abortion after birth, truly a horrifying practice, regardless of where one falls on the spectrum of the--the debate on--on abortion. Are you aware of either of them ever having a social media post blocked? </p><p>MUSGRAVE: I am not. And it seems rather obvious when we talk about those two instances that the pro-life has community has suffered under this censorship. </p><p>CRUZ: Final question, Professor Kontorovich, you talked about--about Section 230. And, indeed, your--your testimony says that--that Section 230 is predicated on the idea that internet companies would provide, quote, \"A forum for a true diversity of political discourse.\" Number one, that language is from the statute. Number two, Congress could change and repeal that special immunity from liability that no other non-tech publisher enjoys. And, number three, if Congress did repeal Section 230 in the entity, Mr. Parker and others facing the horrific slander and liable he faced would have had an immediate remedy to force them to take that slanderous and libelous conduct--content down immediately. </p><p>Is all of that correct, Professor Kontorovich? </p><p>KONTOROVICH: Yeah, that's all--that's entirely correct. The--the presumption, I would call it a presumption rather than predicate, the obvious statutory presumption defined in Congress was that the immunity is based on the neutrality of the platform. But, I must add that the purpose of the immunity was to encourage companies to filter and moderate content. It was so that they would not be sued for doing so. So, the elimination of that immunity is likely to result in more filtering. But, it could be more ideologically balanced filtering. And whether one wants more net filtering that is overall more neutral rather than less filtering, but more lopsided is, of course, a policy choice for Congress. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Senator Hirono? </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. Mr. Parker, I--well, I'm sorry, Senator Blumenthal--. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: --I--I appreciate Senator Hirono because I have a meeting back in the office and I will be very brief. I just want to ask Mr. Parker a couple of questions if I may, sir. First, thank you for being here. Thank you for your courage and strength. You reflect the incredible bravery of the Sandy Hook families and, although you're not longer a resident of Connecticut, you represent them and many, many others by being here today and working through the grief and pain that still haunts you. And that was aggravated needlessly and cruelly by those harassers who, as I understand it, deny that the Sandy Hook tragedy even occurred. Is that right? </p><p>PARKER: Correct. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And the harassment included threats to yourself and your family. You have two young daughters and that created a lot of fear and disruption in your life, did it not? </p><p>PARKER: Yeah, it did of course. But, this wasn't just stuff that people were hiding behind computer screens, the majority of it was. But, I've had experiences where people have come to me on the street and--and accosted me and called me out and--and yelled profanities. And in one instances I just barely walked away from my family. I had dropped them off at some place and I went and parked the car and I was walking back. So, my children were just--I mean minutes away from experiencing that same--that same experience with me. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And so, the--the impact was not just those harassers and I'm not going to use specific names here, but it had a ripple effect. There were ramifications in real-time and real life of what was happening on the internet. </p><p>PARKER: Exactly. And what was frustrating like I--like I tried to say it was--you know, when we--we felt like by going and asking that this content be removed and we felt like, you know, because they were--they were legitimate threats. And there was real fear there. And how--there's no way that I'm gonna be able to quantify those effects in the way and how--I'm gonna have to wait and see how my children live the rest of their lives before I can see how well we did at helping them process their grief and how much distraction this was for us in our ability to do that properly. </p><p>And so, I know the effects that it's had on me and what I need to do to heal. And I'm an adult and I can process those things. And knowing how much energy that is for me and what--there isn't a child version of grief. They--they feel the same things and to the same weight that I do. And so, knowing what I felt I can imagine what my children are feeling. And knowing that there were times when I wasn't available to them like I should have been because I was dealing with these things. There's not a price to put on that effect. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: The fact that Facebook failed or refused to take action itself aggravated that pain, did it not? </p><p>PARKER: Well, absolutely, I mean because Facebook it likes to share things. And so, you start sharing things and it gets proliferated around and around and around. And one thing that I took out of my testimony that I wasn't getting--just for context and time, but I had some really good friends that--that they set up a memorial page for my daughter and it was a place where people could go and express their condolences and their love and support. And we ended up having to take that page down because of all the inundation of vile videos and comments and attacks at--that wasn't just at me, but it was at other people and friends of mine that were receiving phone calls at their houses because of their support for us. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: In effect, this harassment, permitted by Facebook, censored you. </p><p>PARKER: Exactly. The--when--like I said in my testimony, when we--when we tried to get them to respond in any form their--their response was that they couldn't--at that time felt like they couldn't moderate what people were saying and expressing their opinions. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: The pain and anxiety experienced by you was shared by other families as well, was it not? </p><p>PARKER: Yeah, it's--it's--when we get together it's definitely something that we talk about. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: And do you know whether victims and survivors of similar kinds of tragedies have seen the same in their own lives? </p><p>PARKER: Yeah. So, my approach was--I was taught, you know, how to deal with bullies was to ignore them and they will go away. And that's what I was teaching my children and not exposing them to this. But, as time went on and they weren't going away and it kept being proliferated, I finally realized that my children are gonna get old enough that they're gonna run into this. And what am I gonna do to protect them. They see how hard I worked to protect Emilie's memory. What are my living children gonna wonder about what I'm doing to protect them? </p><p>I had a conversation with a family from Parkland whose daughter was murdered. They share the same faith as ours and we were talking and one of the comments that the--the wife made was I don't--she was commenting about videos about her husband because he had made some public comments. And she goes I don't know if you guys ever experienced anything like this. And we just kind of had that black humor laugh like, no, of course we've experienced this. And that was when I realized that I needed to take a more proactive approach in this and proactively try and protect not just my family, but future victims because there are so many. And, unfortunately, we know that there will be others. And I have the energy now to be able to fight that fight when I know that they don't. And so, I stepped in for them. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: Thank you for being here. You and I have never discussed this issue before have we? </p><p>PARKER: No. </p><p>BLUMENTHAL: But, I'm deeply grateful to you for being here today and I think countless others are as well. Thank you very much Mr. Parker. </p><p>PARKER: Thank you, senator. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you. Senator Hirono? </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. Before I begin my questions, I'd like to ask unanimous consent to enter a number of items into the record. The statement of Andy Parker, whose daughter, Alison Parker, was shot and murdered while reporting on live TV in August 25. Like our witness, Robbie Parker, Andy Parker and his family have been the targets of online conspiracy theories, harassment and threats. The statement of Corynne McSherry of Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the statement of Berin Szoka, I hope I'm pronouncing the name right, of TechFreedom. I'd also like to enter into the record with unanimous consent entering Dr. Tripodi's articles relating to--well, a report titled Searching for Alternative Facts, Analyzing Scriptural Inference in Conservative News Practices. And another of her articles entitled No, Big Tech Isn't Silencing Conservatism. </p><p>CRUZ: Without objection, all of the referenced materials will be entered into the record. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. Mr. Parker, I, too, extend to you our--my and our deepest condolences for the tragic loss of your daughter. And I thank you for your courage and that of your entire family. So, I'm wondering whether the tech companies that you contacted ever apologized to you for the--the kind of--of posts that were so hurtful and damaging to your family? </p><p>PARKER: This afternoon after the first panel was done the representative from Twitter and Facebook approached me and talked to me and expressed their condolences and apologies. </p><p>HIRONO: Obviously, Google, which is not here, they still have posts as I showed in my chart, that they still have posts that has conspiracy theories and attacking you for basically lying. So, there's work to be done with those folks. </p><p>I have some questions for Dr. Tripodi. You know, President Trump, this past summer, tweeted that Google rigs its search results in favor of supposedly liberal news quint outlets. Based on your research, does Google rig its search results against conservatives? </p><p>TRIPODI: Thank you, senator. Based on my research from what I was arguing in my testimony, the results that we received from Google are more based on what we put into Google then what we get out of it. </p><p>HIRONO: I think that's a very--really important point to make because depending on what kinds of words you put in, out will pop different kinds of sites and links. </p><p>TRIPODI: Exactly. </p><p>HIRONO: And so, if you put in certain things that are viewed--a lot of conservative--of what might be deemed conservative sites and links will pop up and you put something else in you get--you'll get some other kinds of results. So, I think that that is a very important point that you made, thank you very much. </p><p>We have heard various anecdotal evidence of bias. There are other examples like Chick-fil-A appreciation--appreciation day page that--where--that was removed from Facebook for approximately 24 hours in 2012 and certain videos produced by (INAUDIBLE) that have either been taken down or demonetized. What leads to a page being taken down by Facebook or a video being demonetized on YouTube, do you know Dr. Tripodi? And do examples like these demonstrate bias on the part of tech and social media companies? </p><p>TRIPODI: Thank you so much for this question. I think this is actually a very important point for this hearing. We've been using conversations about censorship and bias to describe actually five to six different things and--as far as what I've been listening to in terms of testimony. So, we've been thinking about advertising. We've been thinking about content moderation. We've been thinking about deplatforming. We've been thinking about restrictions that different sites might put on their videos as to age restrictions. And we've been also talking about demonetization. And I think being very clear about what you're discussing is of upmost importance. </p><p>So, in response to some of the conversations that you've been talking about--and I believe this a--this is really what's happening with regard to a lot of the testimony today. Issues of content moderation are very murky. And I think we could bipartisanly agree that there needs to be more transparency regarding how content gets flagged. But, I think it is also really important to understand, based on the conversations that I've been listening to, that content moderation is a kind of a many-step process and that it's quite possible that a lot of the content that's being initially removed from these platforms was not because of any kind of executive, but was because of users tagging that content as inappropriate. And that would be a user censor issue not a platform censor issue. And a lot of the content moderation decisions are often made in non-U.S. countries by people who make very low wages and have about three to five seconds to determine if content should go up or--so, I think understanding how the content moderation process works is very important and needs more transparency. </p><p>HIRONO: In your testimony you also discussed the ways that organizations and individuals use certain tactics to gain the algorithms behind Facebook's and Twitter's feeds. Are these tactics only available to liberals or do conservatives also use these tactics? </p><p>TRIPODI: Well, as my testimony makes clear, these are tactics that I've observed by studying conservative media. But, absolutely, I would say that search engine optimization is not partisan and is something that all corporations and politicians are using. </p><p>HIRONO: I have a question for Professor Kontorovich. You said that--well, if we were to take away the immunity that I think it would lead to more content being deleted or--or whatever the term is. So, you did say that, perhaps, the content could be more ideologically neutral. Do you have evidence, are you citing to something for the proposition that the--these platforms are not ideologically neutral? </p><p>KONTOROVICH: As I said in my comments, I am taking as an assumption for purposes of legal analysis that this problem exists. The existence of the problem is an empirical question, not a legal question. And the point is that the publisher protection treating--treating--two third is treating the companies as not being publishers is to make them not liable for any kind of content. And presumably that the lifting of such limitation would result in a general borage of litigation, which would dwarf any kind of ideological effect. </p><p>HIRONO: I would say so. But, well, assuming that there is not neutral content, how would we ensure ideological neutrality of these platforms? </p><p>KONTOROVICH: I have not suggested that Congress must or should enforce ideological neutrality, actually enforcing ideological neutrality would, itself, raise First Amendment questions. What I have suggested is that Congress is not obligated to provide it special exemptions for these companies as two third it currently does. And, certainly, to the extent that there--to the extent that these companies have substantive content modulation practices disclosing those in a way that consumers of the platform from whom they generate their revenue can understand what they're seeing and understand whether, you know, if they search for something and it doesn't exist is it because it doesn't exist or because it has been screened based on content. And we're never gonna agree what's neutral, but that could be up to consumers to judge and agree. </p><p>HIRONO: So, your view that more of transparency would be the way to go? </p><p>KONTOROVICH: It would be a way that--so, the market--well, I believe the marketplace of ideas is extremely robust in my view, even if conservatives are being discriminated against by these sites. You know, they can go and start their own platforms, crazy as that may seem. That's the whole point of free speech. But, you have to know what's going on to be able to take that action. </p><p>HIRONO: Right. </p><p>KONTOROVICH: So, more transparency would be helpful in that way and not constitutionally problematic. </p><p>HIRONO: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRUZ: Thank you, Senator Hirono. Let me thank each of the witnesses for being here for your testimony. As with the previous panel, the record in this hearing will be kept open for two weeks, two weeks from today. Senators are asked to submit any written questions to any of the witnesses by that date and then each of the witnesses are asked to respond to those questions as promptly as possible. </p><p>I thank you, again, for the time and energy and expertise that--that you have shed on this important issue. And with that, this hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVY-3661-F15W-H3P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Small numbers except at this point here, and that's all about a presidential tweet that we will explain during the course of the program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The market looks like it's down. These are the reasons why. Tech hearings on the Hill. Social media executives are being grilled by senators on a wide variety of subjects. Bank earnings coming thick and fast, setting the stage for the earnings season. And Boeing 737 MAX crisis. Ryanair is making cuts because there aren't enough planes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, live from London on Tuesday, July the 16th. I'm Richard Quest here in London, of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening, tonight a day of reckoning across a variety of issues for Silicon Valley. Over the course of three hearings in Washington, U.S. lawmakers are trying to determine how much power tech companies should have.</p><p>Two more hearings are about to get underway. First, the House Judiciary Committee where executives are being asked about antitrust fears in the tech sector and the second in the Senate, where lawmakers will question Google over alleged censorship in search engines.</p><p>Perhaps though, the most significant came earlier in the day on Facebook's cryptocurrency, the new one that it's announced, Libra. Republicans a Big Tech is stifling conservative speech. Democrats are threatening to break up its antitrust, and everyone is worried about Libra.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH): Now, Facebook asks people to trust them with their hard earned paychecks, it takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance, a breathtaking amount of arrogance to look at that track record and think, you know what we really ought to do next? You know what we ought to do next? Let's run our own bank and our own for profit version of the Federal Reserve and let's do it for the whole world.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): What confidence can people who have center right news have that Libra is going to be available to them on an equal basis as those who want to shutdown gun retailers or shutdown oil pipelines or government contractors who are working with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement?</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): Isn't it true -- I really want your opinion that Facebook has chosen to advance a set of values and which truthful reporting has been displaced by flagrant display as a [bleep].</p><p>DAVID MARCUS, VICE PRESIDENT OF MESSAGING PRODUCTS, FACEBOOK: I don't have to answer that question, sir.</p><p>KENNEDY: Okay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Yes, It's called Libra. Some people are calling it Zuck bucks. And Facebook really doesn't like that. But this is Libra. And to understand this, and it's really worth taking a moment or two to explain it because it's going to be here for some time, and it's going to get bigger.</p><p>There are two parts to Libra. The first is Libra, the cryptocurrency itself and the network to move it and manage it. It's not managed by Facebook. It's managed by these 28 partners, all of whom have signed up.</p><p>So you've got Uber, you've got Visa, you've got -- PayPal is involved, E- bay -- they've all signed up to go along with this crypto currency called Libra. Now that's the currency. Then you've got Calibra, which is Facebook's own Libra wallet.</p><p>But remember, all these other partners can also have a wallet as well. The difference is Facebook's got 2.4 billion members and the Facebook or the wallet is how you'll use Libra, whether it's through Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp. And that's the frightening part in the views of the critics because Facebook controls these other companies and will use their own software to send money from Facebook wallets to other wallets.</p><p>We want you to join the conversation, get out your phones and go to -- or digital devices perhaps, cnn.com/join. The question is simple. Do you trust Facebook to run a cryptocurrency? Do you trust Facebook to run a cryptocurrency? Vote now at cnn.com/join.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies are going to be here to stay. Clare Sebastian is in New York. She followed the hearing. How surprised were you at the animus displayed against Facebook and Libra?</p><p>[15:05:04] CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Not too surprise, Richard is because this really follows a barrage of criticism that we've seen towards the Facebook project. It has come from the President. It has come from the Federal Reserve Chair. He says he has serious concerns about this. They don't know yet how it's going to be regulated.</p><p>And we heard yesterday from the Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnunchin who said that he also has serious concerns and is worried about how the regulation is going to work as well. So everyone is concerned about it. It's united people on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>But what I was interested see, Richard is how deep they went into this. These lawmakers who have been criticized in the past for perhaps not understanding how Big Tech works very well have really read into this and have gone very deep into it. And one of the key concerns is how Facebook will handle user data.</p><p>I want to play this exchange between Senator Menendez and David Marcus. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): How specifically are you going to keep the data separate?</p><p>MARCUS: So the way that we keep the Calibra data separate from the rest of Facebook is that actually within our infrastructure, we have separated the data from the rest of Facebook's infrastructure and data in order for it not to get commingled with the rest of the data.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Even though in your user agreement, you say that you're going to may very well share aggregate data with Facebook.</p><p>MARCUS: Aggregate data that we may use on the Culebra, wallet side, non- identifiable data --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Clare, there are two issues here. The first is the data as you rightly point out, but the second is what one might describes as the macroeconomic, the monetary policy side of it, and you need fiat currency to get into Libra. So you'd have to take dollars, euros, lira or whatever to get into the Libra. But once there if you have two and a half billion people exchanging money outside of the traditional monetary circles, what could that mean?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: You know, it could have serious monetary policy implications, Richard and not just because of what they call the on and off ramps, the ability to move in and out of fiat currency. But because this is what's called a stable coin, so it's backed one to one Facebook says, or it will be by a Reserve, which they say it's going to be made up of developed world currencies. They are the stable ones like the dollar, yen, euro, and other things like Central Bank deposits and things like that.</p><p>So Facebook has to ramp up that reserve, the more people are using this currency that really could have an impact on the money supply. And of course, then the question is who is going to be in reserve? Who is going to be regulating it? They're going to have to be trading it to keep it stable.</p><p>There are a lot of questions about how this is going to work from a technical standpoint. And I think that is going to inform how it's going to be regulated going forward. As yet, the situation is that Facebook doesn't exactly know how it's going to be regulated and the regulators don't know either.</p><p>QUEST: Clare Sebastian in New York watching that, as we speak, the summer grilling for tech continues in the House of Representatives. Facebook there has been joined by executives from Google, Amazon and Apple. This time, it's antitrust.</p><p>Democrats have lined up witnesses who say the tech companies have become too large and their power needs to be checked.</p><p>Ashkan Soltani is the former Chief Technologist at the Federal Trade Commission. He's in San Francisco. Good to see you, sir. Thank you. What is the solution, though? If you don't -- I mean, you don't want to break them up? The way it was put to me the other day by a guest, you don't want to take the sledgehammer, like we did Standard Oil, or AT&amp;T, American Business Network years ago. So what do you want to do?</p><p>ASKAN SOLTANI, FORMER CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: Well, so the first question is, what do we have issue with? And one of I think the key concerns that Congress, which is echoing the public's concern is the size and dominance of these companies, both in terms of our everyday lives, but also in terms of the market and market power, right?</p><p>The ability to, for example, using Libra, which you were just talking about, have insights as to market trends and acquire or purchase competitors, would-be competitors, or uprising kind of upstarts before they get huge, right?</p><p>And so I think the goal -- one goal would be to prevent that kind of anti- competitive market behavior. And to do that, breaking them up simply wouldn't be sufficient, because they could just simply join back up again or grow those parts of their business using the dominant firm.</p><p>So I think what -- go ahead, I'm sorry.</p><p>QUEST: After you.</p><p>SOLTANI: One of the interesting pieces, I think, has to do with the fact that it is antitrust and privacy that are intermixed. The ability of the companies to have so much insight as to both individualized behavior, as well as macro behavior in the marketplace, and then leverage those insights to basically outmaneuver, outcompete or disadvantage their competitors and I think the policy needs to be both around antitrust and competition, but also around consumer protection and privacy in order to be effective.</p><p>[15:10:10] QUEST: Thank you. Apologies for the interruptions there, because it is between -- the distance between San Francisco and London, and the so called digital delay.</p><p>Look, back on Libra and what we were talking about there, how realistic are these fears about somehow Facebook running parallel currency that could rise and grow to the scale where it could threaten or at least challenge fiat currencies?</p><p>SOLTANI: Well, look, we have a body that's able to both influence people's behaviors and outcomes, as well as have its own currency. Right? If we add a military, they basically own probably one of the largest nations in the world.</p><p>So I think some of the fears are legitimate, and particularly since what Facebook is really good at is reducing friction, that's the term they use internally, which is getting people to do things and behave a certain way, using their platform rather than anyone else's platform.</p><p>And so while the architecture of the system, Libra is generally is open source, and open to all, likely the behaviors are going to be promoted using the platform on Facebook, and therefore they will have the dominance in terms of a wallet provider and interactions.</p><p>QUEST: Is Big Tech in trouble here? But not just with Libra or whatever. But with all these investigations. I can't really get to understand, are they looking at an existential crisis, or are we looking at politicians merely with noise and hot air?</p><p>SOLTANI: I mean, I think there is a convergence of issues at play, as I said, data privacy, antitrust, censorship, free speech, all kind of all arising one from the power of platforms, and two from the corrosive business models around kind of surveillance economy or surveillance capitalism.</p><p>And so what I suspect is we will see some intervention soon from Congress. We have one in the U.S. here in California, we passed the law, Consumer Privacy Law; you, in Europe have the GDPR. We will probably see something in the next two years to help curb some of this dominance by large tech, how effective that will be still remains to be seen.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Thank you. Again, apologies for the digital delay.</p><p>SOLTANI: No, thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Now, according to those of you voting at cnn.com/join, most of you do not trust Facebook, not even by a small measure. If I squint, I can see 80 percent of you say you do not trust Facebook to manage a cryptocurrency and arguably that could be their biggest problem as they move forward with all of this.</p><p>It is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS tonight from London. As President Trump calls for the Fed to count rate, banks are warning about the impact of cuts on their business. Wall Street has a wave of bank results and they make fascinating reading, in a moment.</p><p>[15:15:41] QUEST: The final hour of trading on Wall Street and the Dow is struggling for a new record. It may make it, it may not. Did it just in the last -- yes, we're at a record at the moment, up 3.4 or five, but it has been see-sawing all day.</p><p>Well, it began with earnings as the Dow fell into the afternoon. And it was very, very simply that large fall was Donald Trump saying quote, \"It is a long way to go on trade talks with China, a long way to go.\"</p><p>Solid bank earnings provided the early lift with Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo beating expectations. Morgan and Wells Fargo are worried about a Fed interest rate cut, and Wells Fargo struggling anyway. Look at that, down three percent. Those three numbers.</p><p>Matt Egan, those three numbers tell the story, don't they? Morgan and GS are higher, and Wells Fargo lower, tell me why. Tell me why lower interest rates hit the banks bearing in mind that they'll pay less to savers.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: That's right, Richard. So the problem is that this big decline that we've seen in interest rates and the potential for the Fed to lower rates even further is hurting net interest margins.</p><p>So we've seen JPMorgan it actually dimmed its outlook for net interest margins and said it may have go even further lower if the Fed cuts two or three times which is what the market is pricing in. Wells Fargo suffered a decline in net interest margin. And we also Citigroup, their margins were under pressure as well.</p><p>And so the issue is that the Fed rate cuts have actually made it harder for banks to make money on the difference between what they pay out to deposit holders on interest and what they charge to lenders.</p><p>Now, the other interesting point here is that Wells Fargo actually said that its deposit costs came up very significantly over the past year and they actually blamed fed rate hikes. That's because there's been this lagging impact from Fed rate hikes. So in some ways, the banks are kind of getting hit on both sides from all the swings and the volatility in the Fed.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But the banks have also been able to park and continue to park large numbers of reserves, gaining interest on those.</p><p>EGAN: Right, absolutely. And I think with really interesting is that the banks themselves, there's so much uncertainty about what happens next, you know, every conference call, all the banks were asked, \"Well, how many rate cuts are you expecting? How many times do you think the Fed will move?\" And clearly they don't know.</p><p>We saw range of forecast between one and three and Wells Fargo flat out said during a press call that they're just not sure what's going to happen. So you can see how this does make things a little bit difficult for banks when it comes to planning.</p><p>But you know, Richard, the bright spot really continues to be the U.S. consumer. JPMorgan reported double digit increases for credit card sales and merchant processing. JPMorgan had a record profit and Jamie Dimon sounds very bullish on the U.S. consumer.</p><p>QUEST: Matt Egan in New York. Thank you. Major changes at the top of key European institutions. A short time ago, Ursula van der Leyen won the European Parliament's backing to be President of the Commission. It was a slim margin. And of all the abstentions that voted against, she should have lost.</p><p>Van der Leyen is currently the German Defense Minister. She succeeds Jean- Claude Juncker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>URSULA VAN DER LEYEN, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: The task ahead of us humbles me. It's a big responsibility and my work starts now. But my message to all of you is, let us work together constructively because the endeavor is a united and strong Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Christine Lagarde is also resigned at the IMF, to take over the ECB. The appointments go a little way to evening up the gender balance in the top European jobs.</p><p>The motion to confirm van der Leyen as President passed by nine votes. Erin McLaughlin, she nearly didn't get it.</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, and it's to the surprise to a lot of my sources, many of them texting me the words, \"not good.\"</p><p>QUEST: Why?</p><p>[15:20:00] MCLAUGHLIN: Because nine is a very slim majority. She got -- keep in mind, 374 votes required for majority, she got 383. You compare that to Jean-Claude Juncker in 2014, he had a majority of 56 votes, and even then, that was only seen as a 56 percent majority. So this is a very slim margin.</p><p>The other sort of compounding factor in the story is that this was a secret ballot. So who voted for van der Leyen? Is her majority comprised of far left? Far right? Then there's the whole question about the U.K.'s MEPs. It's thought that some of the U.K.'s MEPs and Tories, some Labour voted for her as well.</p><p>In the events of Brexit, those MEPs lose their jobs, they go away. So what happens to her majority then? She was asked that question in a press conference following the vote itself, she said she's not going to have another vote. At this point, her priority is working with pro-E.U. parties to try and build stable majorities.</p><p>QUEST: Isn't the reality, though, that this is a bit of a -- not a bit of it, it's a total fix?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Obviously not because she barely got by compared to so many.</p><p>QUEST: No, what I mean is -- sorry, I understand. No, what I mean is, even her going for the job. Out of nowhere, she wasn't even a candidate. She had not even put down a marker. She didn't campaign. She wasn't one of the spritz leading candidates, and out of nowhere she gets the job.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: And that is being seen even by herself as the fundamental problem. She is the ultimate dark horse candidate in the view of many.</p><p>QUEST: She hasn't been a Prime Minister.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: That's right. She was the Defense Minister in Germany.</p><p>QUEST: She is the Defense Minister, yes.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: She recently stood down, but she is a member of the EPP, which is seen as one of the key reasons why she got the job in the first place with the nomination from the European Council.</p><p>But many are holding exception to the fact that the Council took the decision to scrap the lead candidate process and this is the product of that, a very, very slim majority and now she is having to work overtime to try and make up for it.</p><p>QUEST: Let's assume, clearly, she is competent, and she is able to do the job. She is qualified to do the job. But we do end up with a situation where we have van der Leyen at the Commission. We've got Christine Legarde at the ECBI and remind me, the Council is --</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Charles Michel, the former Belgium Prime Minister.</p><p>QUEST: The former -- who is most certainly qualified to do that. But again, none of them really came out of anywhere.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: And again, that is --</p><p>QUEST: I mean, the Europeans are entitled -- hang on -- when was the campaigning? Where was the noise? Where was the people who wanted the people?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: But someone like Ursula van der Leyen would likely reply to that saying that the Parliament, it was beholden to the Parliament to come up with the majority for one of their lead candidates. After weeks, they were unable to do so.</p><p>So some would argue that it was the Council that had no choice then to put forward their pick, which was a finely tuned balance of various parties and various geographic interests, the gender balance, also in consideration and then put it on Parliament to decide well, here's van der Leyen, are you going to really vote down the first nominee -- female nominee -- for the European Commission President? The answer was no, but by a very slim majority.</p><p>QUEST: And the others go through. Christine Legarde has now resigned as head of the IMF effective beginning of September and she is going to get the job obviously.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well, that is because the head of the ECB, as well as who is the president of the European Council is determined by the European Council Parliament. Their big chip in all of this to play, the big card was the top job for the E.U. which is Commission President because keep in mind, the Commission President, the Commission puts forward all the legislation that needs to make the --</p><p>QUEST: She takes on -- when is that to happen?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: November, November. After the Brexit cliff edge October 31st.</p><p>QUEST: So Juncker still does that?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Thank you. The British pound is coming under pressure, hitting a 27-month low over worries over a disorderly Brexit. They are intensifying. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are both vowing to renegotiate Theresa May's E.U. withdrawal package with Brussels.</p><p>They won't accept the so-called Irish backstop and the two men are in the running to become the next British Prime Minister.</p><p>Tom Newton Dunn is the political editor from \"The Sun.\" He joins me now from London. Good to see you, sir. Your debate with the two men, widely praised but for shedding light -- more light than heat, but the issue is, is it going to be from your understanding, is it going to be Boris Johnson?</p><p>TOM NEWTON DUNN, POLITICAL EDITOR, \"THE SUN\": I think it almost certainly is, yes. He is a country mile ahead of Jeremy Hunt, if you believe a;l the Tory MPs I've spoken to and everyone else has spoken to on actually both sides of the campaign.</p><p>[15:25:06] DUNN: I think Jeremy Hunt had a good campaign. He's out passed expectations of him which weren't particularly high. He was seen as very bland. Some suggestions that Boris Johnson managed to cook the books to make sure it was Jeremy Hunt he faced rather than someone traditionally a bit more charismatic than Michael Gove. But I didn't think he's going to be able to catch him at all. It might be closer than we think, but almost certainly now, Boris Johnson.</p><p>QUEST: Tom, what makes either man think that van der Leyen is going to -- and new Council President, former Belgium Prime Minister is going to renegotiate this deal. I've read their statements. They've talked about getting rid of the backstop. But the reality is, Tom, it's no different than it was when you and I were on Abington Green in March.</p><p>DUNN: We've had these conversations before, haven't we, Richard? And I think we are going to have a few more pretty similar to these as well.</p><p>The answer is, they would say -- they were certainly saying to me in our debate last night, bluff, very straightforward. This time, E.U. Commission, whoever you may be, Miss van der Leyen or Mr. Juncker, we mean it. Theresa May never meant it. That's why you called her bluff. We're going to call your bluff and unless you give us a proper deal that we want, which means no backstop straight onto a nice big fat trade deal, and we get everything we want, then we will walk out without a deal and we will cause economic chaos to Europe.</p><p>Now, that the classic guideline goes which has been the Brexiteers' argument all along, Europe needs British trade more than British these European trade.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Does anyone know all of this? We saw -- yes, well, yes, absolutely. But during the shenanigans in March, we also saw Parliament if it was the only thing they did finally coalesce around is that they wouldn't agree to a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>So again, I mean, I've heard talk about Boris is going to provoke Parliament and all these things. He is going to face exactly the same issues with ducks come October.</p><p>DUNN: He is. There's no two ways about it. Nothing materially were changed at all since May the 29th when Theresa May failed to get her even softer deal through than the one they're proposing through the House of Commons. So what's going on?</p><p>Well, we're slightly scratching our heads all day long. I must admit when Boris Johnson gave me the reply to that question, that he wouldn't accept a time limit to the backstop, a five-year time limit, which is you if you talk to the most optimistic people in Brussels, they suggest that might just be possible.</p><p>I was stunned because I really thought that might be Boris Johnson's way out of all this kind, cut a quick deal, do marginally better than Theresa May and bobs your ankle. There is another theory that I'm beginning to subscribe to which is this isn't just basically driving the car into the brick wall or thinking you can do a no deal Brexit when you've got the House of Commons, you are going to try very hard to block it.</p><p>And that is Boris Johnson is saying the classic trick of all politicians, and he is campaigning in poetry and he intends to govern in prose.</p><p>You've heard that one before, too. That basically means he knows the House of Commons are going to block his no-deal Brexit so he can quite frankly, say whatever he likes to all forms of Tory Party members who want to hear this. They want to hear this other stuff.</p><p>And then he will come up to you and will say, \"Well, do you know what, folks, I'm really sorry. I tried my best. I couldn't get it through. We're just going to have to crack the steel that nobody wanted in the first place.\"</p><p>QUEST: You cynic. You political cynic.</p><p>DUNN: I know, it's terrible.</p><p>QUEST: I'll subscribe to it as well.</p><p>DUNN: I have become cynical.</p><p>QUEST: Never. Good to see you, as always, Tom. Much appreciate you taking time tonight on a busy day. Thank you.</p><p>As you and I continue tonight as Ryanair is cutting its 2020 flight schedule. It says the Boeing 737 crisis is leaving short of planes and investors are now looking on the bright side. It's an interesting read when they like the fact that airline is shrinking. In a moment.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>[15:30:00] RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Hello, good evening to you, I'm Richard Quest, more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. The Trump administration is looking into unsubstantiated claims that Google has links to the Chinese state.</p><p>And as the \"Lion King\" is re-made for a new generation, a billionaire is warning, the real lion population continues to decline. As you and I continue tonight, this is CNN and here, the facts always come first. The top Republican in the U.S. Senate insists that President Donald Trump is not a racist.</p><p>Mitch McConnell was asked about Mr. Trump's recent tweets that targeted several Democratic Congresswomen. The Senate leader said everyone needed to calm down their rhetoric and focus on the issues instead. The House of Representatives is debating a resolution on whether to condemn Mr. Trump for his comments.</p><p>Executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple are testifying in Washington. It's part of -- second part of the House of Representatives anti-trust probe looking into competition in Silicon Valley. Earlier, the Senate, Facebook faced a bipartisan grilling over its plans to launch Libra; a global cryptocurrency.</p><p>Britain's Royal Navy is sending in additional warship and tanker to the gulf. The tanker will deploy next month, the warship later this year. It will replace another warship the HMS Duncan which you can see here. It was recently deployed to the region after the Iranian boats reportedly tried to seize a British oil tanker.</p><p>Exactly 50 years ago, Apollo 11 took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida for the first mission where men walked on the moon. The commemorations and celebrations began today, culminate on Saturday, that is the 50th anniversary, of course, of the moon landing.</p><p>U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is warning Donald Trump he might want to think twice before attacking his age or questioning his mental faculties. Biden says if that happens on a debate stage, he'll challenge the president to a push-up contest right there and then.</p><p>President Trump says his administration will look into unsubstantiated claims that Google is collaborating with the Chinese government. Now, the president is responding to accusations made by Peter Thiel; the tech entrepreneur and prominent Trump supporter. Thiel is alleging Chinese intelligence has infiltrated Google's senior management, and says Google should be investigated for treason.</p><p>[15:35:00] Thiel hasn't provided any evidence for this claim, and Google insists the allegations simply are not true. Ahiza Garcia is in San Francisco. So upon what basis is this extraordinary claim made other than a wing and a prayer?</p><p>AHIZA GARCIA, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: It's entirely unclear why Thiel is making these allegations right now. I mean, unless he knows something that the rest of the general public does not in which case he should, you know, bring forward and elaborate on what he knows.</p><p>But as of right now, it's entirely unclear why he's making these claims, and in fact, you know, Larry Kudlow; the director of the National Economic Council and an adviser to President Trump has said that he has not seen anything to really support this. So, you know, those --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>GARCIA: Claims seem to be largely unfounded as of right now.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, but the president deciding to say he'll look into it, that adds a veneer of legitimacy to these. Do we know how they're going to look into it? Are they bringing in federal agencies and the like?</p><p>GARCIA: It's unclear at the moment. Thiel has said that the FBI and the CIA should be investigating this. But I think it's important to put this into context, right? Right now, Big Tech is facing a lot of scrutiny. As you mentioned earlier, they are -- you know, there are hearings ongoing right now about how big these tech companies have gotten.</p><p>And one thing that's important to remember is that Peter Thiel is on the board of directors of Facebook, and Facebook has been under a lot of scrutiny right now. But with these allegations, a lot of that has -- a lot of that attention has shifted and now --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>GARCIA: Google is leading the -- you know, he's leading headlines.</p><p>QUEST: Good opportunity since you're in San Francisco and you're part of our digital team there covering Silicon Valley. Just to get your perspective and assessment, does Silicon Valley feel under threat as Washington investigates every nook and cranny. When you go out to the bars and restaurants and talk to people in the business, what do they think?</p><p>GARCIA: I mean, I think Silicon Valley is largely quite insulated, to be quite honest. The people that I speak to seem to, you know, it's business as usual. Of course, there is increased scrutiny, and what's interesting is that, you know, for some of that scrutiny to becoming from Peter Thiel who is a major player here in Silicon Valley, and is also one of the more outspoken proponents of President Trump among the tech world.</p><p>It's a really interesting position to be in, but I think that on the ground, you know, for the most part, while there is a sense of this, you know, increased pressure and scrutiny, I think for most of the workers, there are, you know, other concerns such as, you know, treatment within these organizations, and you know, there have been strikes and protests.</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>GARCIA: So, I think the focus is less for the workers on the scrutiny facing big tech.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Please, we need you on more on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS to bring us the stories and the inside of what's going on in Silicon Valley. Thank you. Now, the Boeing 737 Max crisis you and I have talked about many times continues to impact airlines.</p><p>We'll talk about it a lot more. For Ryanair, which is Europe's largest carrier, it's having to scale back plans for next year. It says with Boeing's 737 Maxs grounded, it won't have enough planes to serve all destinations. So, it's reducing flights to some airports, closing some bases completely.</p><p>It hasn't decided which it'll go. Anna Stewart, how much of this is just opportunism? Right, there's too much capacity in Europe -- Ryanair, I don't doubt. You know, the 7 -- the Maxs are grounded, they're not getting new ones, they haven't got capacity, but that's a good thing at the moment.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: It's a bit of both, and Amazon, I spoke to today were certainly rather cynical because yes, this will reduce their growth rate by half next year, they wanted to have 58 planes from Boeing initially for next Summer, they'll only have 30. But as you say, overcapacity is a massive problem at the moment.</p><p>So, this is not necessarily a particularly bad thing. And looking around our share price frankly and its rivals, everyone is looking for maybe higher fares next Summer.</p><p>QUEST: Right, higher -- well, I'm so into the rest of the year and beyond, but we've had a profits warning from Lufthansa. We've had --</p><p>STEWART: Two from Ryanair.</p><p>QUEST: Two from Ryanair. We know that there's too many airlines chasing too few passengers in Europe, hence, while some -- or quite a few of them have gone out of business and more are likely to go.</p><p>STEWART: Yes, AMI, what it really -- Berlin, Munich, yes, this is a bigger problem, and I think for Ryanair, this crusty will come on, they will be buying these planes. But what I was hoping I think in the last earnings report from Michael O'Leary --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>STEWART: Is they'll shake out more competition, and they are doing that. The longer they can keep on going --</p><p>QUEST: But --</p><p>STEWART: And for them it's worth profits and it's worth lower fares.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, but they shake out competition, they were able to do by lower fares and more capacity. If they're taking out capacity, it's good for them. But arguably, I suppose is it good for the competition or do they just continue ramping --</p><p>[15:40:00] STEWART: Well, as long as they could always be slightly lower in the competition, right? That's the game that they play. It's a risky one.</p><p>QUEST: Right, the 737 Max is hitting all airlines who've got it, but particularly Ryanair.</p><p>STEWART: Yes, and it's because of also the fact that the 737 Max 200, which is a slightly different variation of the 737 Max. This is the one that will have slightly more capacity and as a result, they don't expect this one to work or to come on to be certified and to be up in the air until January or February once the other ones gone through the systems. So, that's why we're seeing more of a delay for Ryanair.</p><p>QUEST: OK, the industry overall, we've seen Joon go, which was the Air France -- I was going to say long haul, low cost, but I'm never quite sure what it was. Eurowings --</p><p>STEWART: Just no more --</p><p>QUEST: No, it's no more -- well, it wasn't very big, it was three planes and a dog. And then -- but Eurowings is no longer going low cost, long haul. We have got this problem with the low cost with Ryanair, we've got IAG still with level playing around with that --</p><p>STEWART: Oh, but analysts have down-rated it, frankly, you know, HSBC came and said that this sector in Europe is on -- its biggest decline since the financial crisis and it therefore downgraded a whole load -- this was after a Lufthansa profit --</p><p>QUEST: Right, but you have got oil prices deadly setting --</p><p>STEWART: They are flattening. They are --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>STEWART: They are flattening out, there's some hope here, but there are still too many seats for too few passengers.</p><p>QUEST: Which is a good way for me to say thank you very much for joining us. Thank you. Coming up after the break, the Burberry balance. The great British brand now comes with a distinctly Italian twist, investors are loving it, the share price is roaring ahead. But what happens to the traditional trench coat? That's what I want to know.</p><p>QUEST: Burberry's new Creative Director Riccardo Tisci is transforming the fashion brand. Now, his collections are a far cry from a classic look that we've grown to love, know, and ironically, that is a good thing. Burberry says sales for the latest quarter up 4 percent from a year ago, comfortably ahead of expectations.</p><p>And here's how the shares have reacted, up some 14 percent which for a company and a brand that's been struggling to find direction is really quite an achievement. North Korea's leaders won't let Strip International sanctions stand between them and luxury goods like Burberry.</p><p>[15:45:00] They -- U.S. think-tank thinks it's analyzed an array of data to show how 90 countries have helped to supply high-end items to Pyongyang. CNN's Paula Hancocks is in Hong Kong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's no secret that North Korean leaders and those closest to them like luxury goods. Kim Jong-un; the current leader and his father, the late Kim Jong-il certainly liked the finer things in life.</p><p>Now, these things of course are subject to the strongest international sanctions in the country's history. In a report published on Tuesday from Washington-based center for advanced defense studies, they show how they believe that Pyongyang is bypassing these sanctions. Take cars, for example.</p><p>The report says that Pyongyang imported 803 luxury vehicles from 2015 to 2017. The majority it says originating from Russian state-owned companies. The group gives the example of two armored Mercedes Maybach S600 vehicles, similar to those used to drive world leaders through the streets of Pyongyang worth around half a million dollars each.</p><p>Scouring customs records, shipping data, open source documents. The group tracked the vehicles from the Dutch port of Rotterdam through China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, they then believed they were flown to their final destination of North Korea.</p><p>CNN has not independently verified the reporting of C4ADS. Now, we're talking about luxury goods, and you may think there are far more pressing concerns when it comes to North Korea. But the group believes that by understanding the root that luxury goods take to reach North Korea, then it could help law enforcement trying to stop Pyongyang obtaining more dangerous items with military applications. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: So, let's update the markets and how they closed in Europe. Crossed higher across the board on Tuesday, good gains with the best being seen just over there in Paris. All the major markets are at the highest point of the week.</p><p>Burberry of course, 14 percent helped the FTSE quite nicely, whilst in France, it was the LVMH carrying -- and amazed that boosted the CAC 40, so luxury was the key story of the day in Europe. The last few moments of trade on Wall Street, it's far -- are we going to get a record? Are we going to get a record?</p><p>Well, we were definitely at a record throughout the course of the morning, and then the president tweeted about China trade was not going well and that took the market down. And we have hovered around this area ever since. You've got numerous undercurrents going on, not least of which it is sort of Summer and people don't want to take positions until there's a little bit more certainty, and they are waiting for the Fed to move.</p><p>So, you're going to bounce around this sort of level until there is some sort of direction within the market. Of course, U.S. banks posting better- than-expected earnings, Johnson and Johnson is down. If you look at the Dow over all, you've got Intel at the bottom, you've got the Dow itself, the company at the top.</p><p>That's the way the market -- that's the way the 30 looks predominantly lower, but not by much. As we continue, after the break, the \"Lion King\" makes a comeback, real lions, far from making a comeback. Look, and steep decline, the billionaire philanthropist Thomas Kaplan will be with me next. He has a plan to help and it's an interesting one after the break.</p><p>[15:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: When it comes to Disney moments, it really doesn't get any better than this. Twenty five years since Simba made his mark, and as the new \"Lion King\" movie opens on Friday, serious and stark reminder. But in the real world, big cats remain seriously under threat.</p><p>The number of African lions is halved since 1994. Only 20,000 remaining in the wild. Thomas Kaplan is with me; the chairman of Panthera, the wild cat conservation organization. Good to see you sir, thank you for joining us tonight from Paris. The link-up between yourselves and the ability -- and Disney and the way in which you can draw attention to this. How significant is this?</p><p>THOMAS KAPLAN, CHAIRMAN, PANTHERA: Well, this is a monumental moment for lions. And we've had one other viral moment in lion conservation, and that was unfortunately accompanied by the death of the very famous Cecil in Zimbabwe.</p><p>This occasion, hopefully, will be a more up-beat way to be able to point out what is -- as you rightly mentioned a very sad state of affairs for lions. It's a fact that over the last century, the lion population has plunged from 200,000 to approximately 20,000 today. Lion range has retreated to only 5 percent of their historic range.</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>KAPLAN: I've come to call the lion the big cat that's disappearing in plain sight, and unfortunately, that's really the case.</p><p>QUEST: How do you think you can bring your business into philanthropic experience to bear on this? Because if there's one thing we learned from Bill Gates, it's bringing a corporate mentality and an entrepreneurial spirit into philanthropy can be successful, very successful. How do you propose to do it here?</p><p>KAPLAN: Well, we've been working on big cat conservation for the past 12 years. And the reality is that when we began Panthera, you could have considered it to be a venture capital start-up. Now, we are in fact the leading cat conservation organization in the world with a footprint across all 40 species of wildcats.</p><p>The combination --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>KAPLAN: Is very much the application of business principles, giving off resources and surround yourself with the very best in breed of management and let them run with it. On occasion --</p><p>QUEST: But --</p><p>KAPLAN: They'll fail. But it's much more important to know that we're trying than that we're failing, and our successes have allowed us to be able to score some very big wins across the world.</p><p>QUEST: How do you remain motivated when you have the sort of numbers that you've talked about tonight. I appreciate the success is in the work, and that you're managing, but a sheer look at the numbers suggests a losing trajectory. So how do you remain motivated?</p><p>KAPLAN: You remain motivated by winning. Wildlife needs wins, and that's the kind of thing that we try to focus on. We know that the big cats are under pressure. We know that a cat population that can't thrive is a sign that the entire eco-system is in jeopardy. But when you look at some of the things which we've been able to accomplish, just in lions --</p><p>[15:55:00] QUEST: Right --</p><p>KAPLAN: You have to say that despite the bad news, there's hope.</p><p>QUEST: All right --</p><p>KAPLAN: Let me give you an example. We have a project in Zambia called the Clause Project. It's an anti-poaching project. It has brought 70 --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>KAPLAN: Wildlife security people into the field, and we have managed to arrest dozens of poachers. We've eradicated poaching bases. We've eliminated snares. It used to be that on average, three lions a year were taken by snares. Now, last year, only one was taken.</p><p>These are the kinds of wins that we're looking for. I'll give you an even better example in lions --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>KAPLAN: In Namibia, where we've been working in the Zambezi. The lion populations were decimated --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>KAPLAN: Almost by half between 2012 and 2013. As a consequence of the work which we've been doing with local communities, and putting in what are called Bomas or Corrals in order to prevent --</p><p>QUEST: All right, sir --</p><p>KAPLAN: Lion, livestock, human conflict. We've seen lion populations double. We've seen livestock depredation fall by 80 percent, and 95 percent fewer lion casualties. So, we can have wins if you have the right people, if you have the right partners on the ground, you can score the kind of wins that nature needs.</p><p>QUEST: Thomas, we'll have to leave it there, thank you for joining us, I appreciate your time tonight from Paris. We'll take a profitable moment in just a moment.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment. To hear Thomas Kaplan describing how an entrepreneur, how a businessman brings business principles to philanthropy is fascinating, particularly when you talk about big cats and you know that the numbers are not good, but get the wins that you need to keep the motivation to move forward and you use those principles of business to ensure the results eventually come through.</p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight on a very busy day. Don't think we've seen any records tonight on the Dow, I am Richard Quest in London. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>The bell is ringing, the Dow is down, the day is done.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019071601cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKG-DB31-DXH2-63KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002S0T</classCode><className>RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Federal school safety panel recommends ending Obama-era policy designed to protect minority students.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[10:30:00] JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: That endorsement from the president was ultimately a key step that helped to convince and helped to build the pressure up on Mitch McConnell to bring this to the floor. Advocates of criminal justice reform have previously tried to push these measures through in previous years including under the Obama administration. And when that legislation worked its way to the Senate, Mitch McConnell did not bring it to the floor and ultimately those efforts died there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now we have this legislation passing in the Senate 87-12. It's expected to sail through the House and then go to the president's desk for signature later this week. But it wasn't just, again, Democrats, Republicans. You also had celebrities like Kim Kardashian West making an appearance in the Oval Office encouraging the president to move forward with this. The president was concerned about somebody called Willie Horton, for example, who of course you remember from Dukakis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But again, Kim Kardashian talked to him about Alice Johnson and ultimately, somebody who the president pardons and ultimately the president was able to move forward with this.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Yes. Look, it's fascinating and they came together and they made changes. Democrats gave a little, Republicans gave a little. And look what happens when you do that.</p><p>Jeremy Diamond, thank you.</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Compromise.</p><p>HARLOW: There you go, right?</p><p>Joining us now, CNN Political Analyst, John Avlon, Republican consultant for the Bush White House, CNN Political Commentator, Margaret Hoover. Good morning to you guys.</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>MARGARET HOOVER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Good morning.</p><p>HARLOW: A little Christmas gift for America that Congress can get along and make changes. Margaret, how big is this?</p><p>HOOVER: This is actually an incredible profile. In a time where every day the news is that Congress is broken and it doesn't work and the president can't get along with anyone and the news is bad. Actually, the system worked and it worked really, really well. And you had not just Republicans and Democrats working together, but funders on both sides of the aisle working together, advocates on both sides are working together, the Congress working with the House, and you also had -- this didn't come from anywhere. This was based on laboratories of Democracy, programs that had worked in the states in terms of improving recidivism, improving cost.</p><p>The reason Mitch McConnell brought it, part of the reason is because some of the most sweeping criminal justice reforms that have happened in states, have happened in his own home, state of Kentucky, with the governor there who is controversial on the left but shockingly a hero of the criminal justice reform movement.</p><p>AVLON: I just love -- my wife is celebrating the beauty of federalism because it got something done. And this is a big, big deal. Make no mistake. And what's notable is how it got done, right? This is the way Washington is supposed to work, folks. Take a note.</p><p>First of all, President Trump, Nixon in China, on the issue of criminal justice reform, really using the bully pulpit of the presidency to force Mitch McConnell's hand who had left just a week ago, was saying this is a divisive bill. You know what is not divisive? Like an 87 vote margin in the Senate.</p><p>It was being held up by a couple of extremist who want it all or nothing. And that got blown through by presidential leadership, by constructive compromise on both sides. And this is the way Washington and government is supposed to work. It's refreshing. It's great, credit to the administration and all the senators who showed.</p><p>SCIUTTO: OK. Not to bring you down.</p><p>AVLON: All right.</p><p>SCIUTTO: There is another -</p><p>HARLOW: Thanks so much -- commercial break.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIUTTO: There is another fundamental job of Congress and that is to pass -</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: -- budgets to pay for the stuff the country does. And we are in a situation now Mitch McConnell -- because they can't come to an agreement and the key sticking issue -- money for the president's border wall. It is going to be another short term funding resolution punted into the Congress.</p><p>John, you made the point, this makes money for his wall actually less likely. Of course, you will have Democrats controlling the House. Explain why. AVLON: This is the opposite example of what we just talked about. The president, a week ago saying, welcoming a shut down. Saying he'd be proud to preside over it. That kind of zero some politics blew up in his face because now he has got leverage, Republicans in both houses. He could have gotten something for the wall. Instead, they are going to have to do it.</p><p>They're going to have to do it. They're going upon it and see. Unless he wants to shut down the government over Christmas while eating stone crab at Mar-a-Lago, which is not a good look for him. And then Democrats come into the House. So this is what happens when you do play the all or nothing card, you get nothing -- worst position.</p><p>HOOVER: I'd like to just --</p><p>AVLON: Please.</p><p>HOOVER: -- get a finer point on that because you are missing one angle --</p><p>AVLON: I often miss angles.</p><p>HOOVER: -- which is the point is actually it is not all or nothing with the president. The president just lost an election. And part of the things he is looking at with Congress is many Republicans who lost aren't going to come back to vote for the initiative he wants to get through in a lame duck because he didn't help them win. In fact, they lost because of him.</p><p>And so, Republicans have a massive attendance problem. They are not going to vote on his wall. And so, not only is he not going to get what he wanted. He - it's almost he forgot the lesson that elections have consequences.</p><p>HARLOW: Can you help us understand. There's a Republican consultant - this number. New CNN poll, 81 percent of Republican voters want a wall even when the true numbers show that you know illegal immigration is down, et cetera. It's a problem, but a wall, all the experts say is not what just stops it.</p><p>[10:35:01] HOOVER: Well, yes. So what's happened in the Republican Party since Trump now is the president of the Republican -- he is the president of the United States. He is the leader of the Republican Party. And the Republican Party has shifted further to the right. They have become a more restriction as party on immigration.</p><p>And the wall as we know is a little bit of a metaphor for Donald Trump. He has said nope there is going to be a real wall. Here's the prototype. But he has also said, yes, you can do it with surveillance and cameras and satellites.</p><p>But what it suggests though is that certainly, the center of gravity on the right has shifted to more restriction as position. And what they should - the wall has become this metaphor for getting immigration reform done on Republican terms in way that actually is more restrictions and it is not - this is not the George W. Bush era anymore.</p><p>AVLON: We're way passed that.</p><p>HOOVER: We're way passed that which is like - racism around the edge --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AVLON: Mark Meadows summed it up the other day saying that you know the five billion was an absolute number for the freedom caucus. That that number was the compromise which is just living in kind of a crazy town hall of mirrors utterly divorced from the idea of constructive compromise. Democrats are willing to put you know 1.6 billion in for border security. Now they may get less than that. But that is what happens when you focus on sort of grand standing rather than government.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: There you go.</p><p>HARLOW: We started with compromise.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOOVER: Well, yes. It has nothing to do with immigration.</p><p>AVLON: It's all a dynamic process.</p><p>HOOVER: But this really is a great victory for the country.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. No, it's huge.</p><p>HOOVER: And everybody wins for the criminal justice reform.</p><p>HARLOW: We have been all over it. It's a big deal. Thank you.</p><p>HOOVER: Thank you very much.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Thank you guys.</p><p>HARLOW: Have a good holiday.</p><p>The problems for Facebook continue to pile up. New big report this morning says that the tech giant let more than 150 companies access your private data. Why? And what is Facebook saying?</p><p>[10:41:17] HARLOW: \"New York Times\" investigation reveals Facebook allowed more than 150 companies to access mine and yours and your data including private messages. The access essentially overrode Facebook's usual privacy rules. Big tech companies we're talking about here, Netflix, Spotify. They were - according to \"The Times\" -- able to read messages that you thought were just private. SCIUTTO: They basically lied to you. They said they were private. They said they were covered by the privacy policy. In fact, not. \"New York Times\" deputy investigations editor, Gabriel Dance, helped break the story. He joins us now.</p><p>Gabriel, the thing that stood out to me and to Poppy, frankly, was this idea of allowing these companies to read your private messages. I mean, what is the justification for that? Is there any precedent for this?</p><p>GABRIEL DANCE, DEPUTY INVESTIGATION EDITOR, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Well, it's great question. The fact is that Facebook allowed these companies' access for integration that Spotify and Netflix were using to send recommendations, according to those companies. Now that might be the case, but what actually we see in the documents is that Facebook gave them access to do a lot more than just that. So if they wanted to just send things through Facebook messenger, there were ways they could do that without having this kind of very deep invasive access.</p><p>HARLOW: There are questions, Gabriel, and you bring them up in your reporting which is incredibly important. So kudos to you and the team. It's Netflix, it's Spotify, it's Amazon being permitted to see this stuff, Yahoo, et cetera. They have been doing this. Facebook may have broken the law. They may have broken a 2007 agreement with the FTC. Did they? And what is Facebook saying?</p><p>DANCE: Well, I believe the consent agreement was entered into -- in 2011. But it's a great question as to whether or not they have violated that consent agreement. Facebook is seemingly expanding this definition they have of what they call service providers. And that's very important to their argument. And that's because the FTC consent agreement allows them to share data with service providers.</p><p>Now, to many people service providers reads as things like your Internet service provider or cellular networks so that when you go to Facebook.com or look at it on your phone, you're able to see Facebook. But Facebook has broadened that definition to include first of all device makers including Chinese device makers like Huawei, Apple and some others. But now they are starting to say, well, Yahoo who has never made devices, they are also a service provider. And people like Warner Brothers are a service provider and some of these other companies are service providers.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>DANCE: So it's their definition versus what the FTC is willing to enforce.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Facebook's response to all of this?</p><p>DANCE: Well, it's basically along the lines of what I was just saying which is this is all OK because essentially, these companies are operating as extensions of Facebook itself. And when they first told us that back in June, it was a real head scratcher, this idea that somehow Blackberry and HTC and other others are extensions of Facebook. But that is the line they are taking.</p><p>SCIUTTO: That is not my understanding.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>SCIUTTO: I mean, I didn't look at it that way.</p><p>HARLOW: That's a great point. Finally, before you go, in the statement that Facebook gave you guys, they said that they need, quote, \"clear policies\" and that they need to do better on this. They know that. They want - they welcome, they say, government regulation.</p><p>We know that they have gotten on board and are in support of the honest ads act, right, put forward by Senator Amy Klobuchar, right, to display where ads come from for political things, et cetera. But that wouldn't effect this at all, right? I mean, have they really said yes, we are on board with policies that would curb this kind of behavior?</p><p>[10:45:08] DANCE: They have not. This kind of behavior -- these kind of practices by Facebook right now are fundamental to their company. So they're doing everything they can to explain why these are OK and not at all interested in making this kind of information unavailable. That said, they said they are winding down -- despite the fact that they say the partnerships are fine and OK, they are also winding them all down.</p><p>HARLOW: That's a big deal. I'd urge everyone to read your full report. Thanks Gabriel very much.</p><p>DANCE: Thank you so much.</p><p>HARLOW: We'll be back after this.</p><p>[10:50:10] HARLOW: Welcome back. President Trump is sticking by his push to arm teachers. Listen to the president just yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is critical to have armed personnel available at a moment's notice. These are people, teachers in many cases that are the highest trained that you can get.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: He was meeting with members that are part of this commission on school safety. It goes a step further, though, than what they have recommended. That report says schools should work with law enforcement to arm school personnel, not directly teachers.</p><p>SCIUTTO: The report also suggests an Obama-era regulation designed to limit punishing minority students at higher rates. Commission claims that that policy actually makes schools less safe by discouraging schools from punishing students properly. Joining us now is someone who's paid a price for this that none of us can imagine. He is Max Schachter, his 14-year-old son Alex was killed in the Parkland shooting. And Max, thank you for taking the time. We as parents shake our heads as we see and imagine what you have gone through. We just want to thank you for speaking out and spending some time with us.</p><p>MAX SCHACHTER, FATHER OF ALEX SCHACHTER, VICTIM IN PARKLAND SHOOTING: Thank you. It's good to be here.</p><p>SCIUTTO: So you were in the White House yesterday. You met with President Trump for this roll out. He goes down this path of arming teachers. What did he say to you and what did you say back?</p><p>SCHACHTER: I think, you know, when the president says that, it's important to keep in mind the set of facts. Most of these mass murderers occur in a matter of minutes. They are over in four to five minutes. In the Parkland shooting in a minute and a half, 24 people were shot and killed. In under four minutes, all 17 people were dead. And it's happening instantaneously.</p><p>Law enforcement is not able to get there in time to stop the carnage. This murderer reloaded his gun five times. There were five times he had an empty gun where if an armed personnel was armed they could have stopped and eliminated this threat. The last thing we want is to have a guy with a gun, an AR-15 walking down the hallway intent on murdering your son or daughter.</p><p>And if this happens, the question is, do you want an armed person there to defend your child and to take him out, eliminate him? And unfortunately, we've got 400 million guns in the United States. We have 11 million AR-15s. This is the new normal. As sad as it is, I want it to stop.</p><p>But I wake up every day missing my little boy and number two, worried about the next school attack. We know the next mass murderer is already out there. We know the next gun is out there. The question is how are we going to make our schools safe?</p><p>HARLOW: Look, there he is. And we will keep his picture on this screen so everyone can look at that smile of your 14-year-old boy that you should never have lost. When you look at the recommendations here, the commission did not recommend any major changes to state or federal gun laws, encouraged states to help support and allow courts to temporarily take guns away from those that are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others. But do you want to see further action on the gun front?</p><p>SCHACHTER: Yes. Absolutely. I'm in favor of you know gun safety and gun measures to make sure that all children, all teachers are protected. So that's something that we can definitely talk about. But I think this is a good first step. As I travel around the country I notice that schools do not know what to do to make them safe. They are lost. Schools are based on educating their children and now they have to be security experts. So I came up with a vision and that is to create a clearing house, to create a repository to house national school safety best practices, to give guidance to schools nationwide.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>SCHACHTER: And I am glad that the president put this in the recommendation. This has never been done before. And I think this is going to be a monumental step and the first significant progress we have had in 20 years since columbine.</p><p>HARLOW: Before you go, Max, this is an unbelievably hard time for you, the holidays, of course. We can't understand what it is like to be in your shoes, but tell our viewers what you want them all to remember about your son as we put his image, Alex, back on the screen.</p><p>SCHACHTER: I mean, my little boy was wonderful. He just wanted to play with his friends. He wanted to be with his brother and his big sister and his little sister. And you know his mom and I miss him every day. We wish he was here. Alex is with me every day when I travel to the White House.</p><p>[10:55:00] I think that we are going to make our children safe. And I think this report is a step in the right direction.</p><p>HARLOW: Max, thank you for your work from both of us.</p><p>SCIUTTO: We are heartbreaking for you.</p><p>HARLOW: We are.</p><p>SCHACHTER: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank all of you for being with us today. We'll see you back here tomorrow morning. I'm Poppy Harlow.</p><p>SCIUTTO: I'm Jim Sciutto. \"AT THIS HOUR\" will be right back after a short break.</p><p>[10:59:46] PAMELA BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: Hello.

John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who heads the Senate Commerce Committee, opened Wednesday's hearing by saying there's a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats for a new data privacy law.</p><p>But the approach being pondered by policymakers and pushed by the internet industry leans toward a relatively light government touch. That's in contrast to stricter EU rules that took effect in May.</p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, says examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>The companies \"aren't going to tell that story\" to the Senate panel, she said. \"These companies make their money off consumer data.\"</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators elsewhere have started to act.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice-president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he says the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties. Thune's pronouncement and one from a White House official stress that a balance should be struck in any new legislation - between government supervision and technological advancement.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who heads the Senate Commerce Committee, opened Wednesday's hearing by saying there's a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats for a new data privacy law.</p><p>But the approach being pondered by policymakers and pushed by the internet industry leans toward a relatively light government touch. That's in contrast to stricter EU rules that took effect in May.</p><p>An early move in President <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, says examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>The companies \"aren't going to tell that story\" to the Senate panel, she said. \"These companies make their money off consumer data.\"</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators elsewhere have started to act.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice-president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he says the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties. Thune's pronouncement and one from a White House official stress that a balance should be struck in any new legislation - between government supervision and technological advancement.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

But it will be tricky to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the usage of their personal data   where they've been, what they view, who their friends are  and the powerful companies that mine it for profit. Senior executives from AT...Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications are scheduled to testify at the hearing, amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. </p><p>Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who heads the Senate Commerce Committee, opened Wednesday's hearing by saying there's a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats for a new data privacy law. But the approach being pondered by policymakers and pushed by the internet industry leans toward a relatively light government touch. That's in contrast to stricter EU rules that took effect in May. An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT...Comcast and Verizon share that information. Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, says examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings. The companies 'aren't going to tell that story' to the Senate panel, she said. 'These companies make their money off consumer data.' What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire 'life cycle' of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold. Meanwhile, regulators elsewhere have started to act. The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons. A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information. Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the 'possible unintended consequences' of California's approach. For instance, he says the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data. The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry. 'A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,' the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. 'A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.' The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties. Thune's pronouncement and one from a White House official stress that a balance should be struck in any new legislation   between government supervision and technological advancement. The goal is a policy 'that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,' White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. 'We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.' </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121537981672907251764100058</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TBT-TKX1-JB5Y-N3DT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><timeReceived>5:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 26, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00027JF</classCode><className>CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Thune's pronouncement and one from a White House official stress that a balance should be struck in any new legislation - between government supervision and technological advancement.<br/> The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDMAN-n10675640</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDMAN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDG-SGP1-JBYT-H1TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Manufacturing News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 27, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00027JF</classCode><className>CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Lawmakers want to hold another hearing on the topic with industry executives as legislative proposals work their way through Congress. Context: On Wednesday, the Department of Justice unveiled suggested language to amend the law[1] with the backing of the White House and Republican attorneys general. What's happening: On Oct. 1, the Senate Commerce Committee will vote to authorize subpoenas for Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai and Twitter's Jack Dorsey.But, but, but: It's doubtful Democrats will be on board, which puts the outcome of the subpoena vote in flux, though Republicans run the Senate Commerce Committee. On Thursday, Sen.

Senior executives from AT&amp;;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications are expected to testify at the hearing, amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians.</p><p>But the approach to privacy legislation being pondered by policymakers and pushed by the internet industry leans toward a relatively light government touch.</p><p>An early move in President <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;;T, Comcast and Verizonshare that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, says examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>The companies \"aren't going to tell that story\" to the Senate panel, she said. \"These companies make their money off consumer data.\"</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators elsewhere have started to act.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties. Thune's pronouncement and one from a White House official stress that a balance should be struck in any new legislation - between government supervision and technological advancement.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Senior executives from AT&amp;;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications are expected to testify at the hearing, amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians.</p><p>But the approach to privacy legislation being pondered by policymakers and pushed by the internet industry leans toward a relatively light government touch.</p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, says examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>The companies \"aren't going to tell that story\" to the Senate panel, she said. \"These companies make their money off consumer data.\"</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators elsewhere have started to act.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties. Thune's pronouncement and one from a White House official stress that a balance should be struck in any new legislation - between government supervision and technological advancement.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

All of that and so much more coming  up this morning.</p><p> Fox News correspondent, Lea Gabrielle, Benchmark managing partner, Kevin  Kelly and Forbes Media chairman, former republican presidential candidate,  Steve Forbes.</p><p> When you walked in this morning, I went I am so glad you're here.  Any day,  but particularly this day, Mr. Forbes.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because we have the same feeling about this tax cut package.   But if you listen to the democrats, we're going to hell.  That's pretty  much the message.  The country is going hell.  It's savory and I just say,  poppycock to that.  So we're going to get into that immediately.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, it's a good word to use on a family channel.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I have an entire lexicon of things like that, like gooey  and poppycock, and balderdash.  So I will break all of that out.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  I think I heard you called the democrats  when it's coming into this plain nincompoops.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  You know what?  I actually called the  republicans nincompoops.</p><p> KELLY:  That's what it is.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  As thy are putting this together, this is -- </p><p> FORBES:  Another old word is knuckleheads.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Knuckleheads.  This is what we're going to talk about though,  that why do people not yet feel good about this tax reform?  Part of it is  the problem of how they put it together.  So we're going to talk about that  in two seconds.  I just want to tease our guests that are coming up,  Illinois congressman, Peter Roskam.  Fox News senior judicial analyst,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Louisiana senator, John Kennedy.  Former  republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  And administrator of the  small business administration, Linda McMahaon.  There's a lot in this  package for small businesses as well.</p><p> But first, on the verge of a big tax victory.  Republicans are set to give  their final approval to a sweeping tax overhaul today after the senate  passed a plan and a late night vote.</p><p> House are scheduled a final vote this morning on the plan ready to send it  to President Trump's desk to sign it into law.</p><p> Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell says that both American businesses  and individual tax payers will see the benefit.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCCONNELL:  We had three, two quarters in a row of three percent growth.   Stock market is up.  Optimism is high.  Coupled with this tax reform,  America is ready to start performing as they should have for a number of  years.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The president congratulating lawmakers on Twitter, writing \"The  United States senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut in reform  barrel.  Terrible individual mandate, Obamacare repealed.  Goes to the  house tomorrow morning for a final vote.  If approved, there will be a news  conference at the White House at approximately 1:00 p.m.</p><p> Steve Forbes, we're on the precipice of passing this first major tax  overhaul.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" is saying certainly on the business  side, it actually does more in some ways than the '86 tax reform did in  terms of reforming corporate taxes.</p><p> FORBES:  The big news on the business side reducing the rate, corporate  rate down to 21 and pastors and its partnerships, Ascopr in the like which  how most American businesses organize for tax purposes.  They got that rate  down.  Looks like 29.6.  We'll have to see the final details on that.</p><p> Overseas earnings, no longer being penalized and bringing some of that cash  back home.  Instant expensing.  So if there are no sleepers in this bill,  and the market, I think would have fare the amount by now.  They did good  on that side.  The individual side is where they've got to do work the next  time.</p><p> And I hope today -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  When is the next time?  When is that?</p><p> FORBES:  Well, this is what they should announce today.  That oh, yes, it's  great history, since 1986 and all that good stuff.  What they should also  announce is this is a down payment.  This is the first of many big tax cuts  to come.  Give people anticipation, especially on the individual side.   We're going to keep slashing taxes because you the Americans create the  resources and can employ them better than Washington bureaucrats.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think the question though for many of us, is that really  possible if you look at the debt worth, 20 trillion in debt and people can  show that a national security issue.  So, can you -- is it really feasible  -- </p><p> FORBES:  What history shows -- experience shows is the only way you get a  balanced budget, if you want that is what the booming economy.  Late 1960s.   Kennedy tax cuts, finally in the 90s, after the Cold War and Reagan's Cold  War victory massive tax cuts.  So if you want to get the Russian's fiscal  situation under control, that economy where people feel good.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  On that note, Steve, the budget deficit has grown in the last  two years.  Spending has gone up, but not that much, it's because revenues  haven't been growing in the most recent fiscal year revenue grew at one  percent and in an expansion, it should be growing at three to five percent,  but this recovery, this growth period in American history has been so weak  because of regulations and because of flawed tax code quite frankly.</p><p> FORBES:  The last decade was at the worst economic growth since the 1930s.   And so that's why I think even deregulation sounds boring, but regulations  are attacks and the fact they are moving regulations, Washington isn't  getting up each morning figuring out how to make life more miserable for  business, has already had an impact.</p><p> And you're going to see now that this thing is going to be actually in  reality.  You're going to see much more investment.  And what democrats  refuse to recognize is, if you want a higher standard of living, you have  to have people making investments, creating those new products and  services, there's better paying jobs.</p><p> And one of the things they should emphasize is not just going to keep more  what you now earn, but your earnings, your pay is going to up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  Thank you.  To all of these democrats, not one  democrat voter for this plan.  And I tweeted this out earlier.  \"More than  80 percent of people, of taxpayers in this country, at least in the first  year are going to get a tax cut.  They're going to see more money in their  paycheck.</p><p> They're going to get to keep more of the money that they earned.  So try  running on that, because the democrats think that the messaging is that  again, the country that we -- this is a scam, whatever language that you  want to pit.</p><p> But again, try running on giving people more of their money.</p><p> KELLY:  Well, the problem is that democrats don't have any right to critic  this plan because none of them voted for it.  We're limited to $155  trillion.  We've seen under the previous administration that they didn't  even want to tackle deficits.  So we're in this vicious circle where all of  a sudden now the democrats have found religion when it comes to deficits.</p><p> But at the detriment of the American people that actually need strong  growth, they've been under the thumb of rules and regulations including the  Obamacare, as President Trump has alluded to.</p><p> But I think the important thing to take away from this is that it's cheaper  is for companies to invest here in the United States than it is abroad,  right?</p><p> But there was a detriment for them to invest here, when you can have four  corporations coming in and compete at a lower tax rate.  Look over at the  U.K., right?  Twenty percent corporate tax rate that are going to take to  17.5 percent.</p><p> We are nowhere near competitive.  We have one of the highest corporate tax  rates in the world.  So, how do you get companies to invest here?  You  unleash prosperity through property plan, equipment when they can reinvest  in a 21 percent rate.</p><p> FORBES:  One of the things that republicans should learn from this is get  rid of this constraint, from this congressional budget office, these fakes,  projections out 10 years that assume the tax cuts don't do much for the  economy, get rid of that.  Assume 3.5 percent growth and by golly have  greater muscular tax cuts.  One must be a tax cut in the future.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I need to get this.  This is what I want to you -- I want to get  your answer on this and it goes to the way that the democrats have been  messaging this.  While markets are optimistic about this tax plan, business  owners and operators are optimistic.  It remains unpopular with the  American people.  Actually, it's become more unpopular.</p><p> This is a new \"Wall Street Journal-NBC News\" poll that found 41 percent of  Americans say that the tax plan is a bad idea.  Just 24 percent of it say  it's a good idea.  Top republicans insist the numbers will shift in the  coming months.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCCONNELL:  My view of this, if we can't sell this to the American people,  we ought to go into another line of work.  I think this is an important  accomplishment for the country, that people will value and appreciate, but  obviously it requires us to continue this discussion.</p><p> REP.  PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  People are out there  on TV telling mistruth, disguising the facts of this thing.  That's going  to make it unpopular.  When we get this done, when people see the  withholding improving, when they see the jobs occurring, when they see  bigger paychecks, a fairer tax system, a simpler tax code, that's what's  going to produce the results.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Richard Rubin is the reporter at \"The Wall Street Journal\" and  he points out and I did as well on Twitter, 80 percent in the first year,  80 percent of households get a tax cut.  At least, if not more than that.   But 17 percent of people think they're getting tax cuts.  That is  unbelievable.</p><p> Bit to the democrats who are saying it's a scam.  Tom Perez, the head of  the DNC said in his statement taxes are going up.  Yet, taxes are going up  for people when these tax cuts expire, eight or ten years from now.  That's  a lie.</p><p> The American people are being told lies by the democrats.  But I say to  them, I say to these liberals who are messaging this, you know what?   People are going to get more money back.  They're going to see money in  their paychecks.  So good luck with that.</p><p> FORBES:  You see, one of the problems with the mainstream media is located  they're located in New York and California.  Many of them won't see a tax  cut because the loss of state and local deductions.</p><p> So in their little world this thing doesn't look so good.  They forget the  rest of the country.  And one of the things republicans have got to do is  more messaging.  Not just say the results and speak for themselves, but  explain to people why this is better and also start talking about payroll  reform.</p><p> Six years ago, they allowed for a couple of years people to keep their  first two points on the social security tax, even if you didn't pay income  tax, which many Americans don't.  You got a higher paycheck, so they should  put that on the table, say, if we get reelected, everyone in the work is  going to get another tax cut.  Start throwing out things for the future.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're not going to argue about that because the payroll tax --  well, the payroll tax goes to fund the benefit.  It goes to fund social  security and Medicare.</p><p> FORBES:  But the fact of the matter is they use the general budget when  they need it.  And they've used this for political purposes to make sure  everyone feels it for a couple of years and you do more muscular tax cuts.   So it's part of a plan -- set of this kiddy credit, which is a giveaway for  people </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have to go.  But I want to point something out.  When in this  country did we start believing that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and  democrats make better decisions with our money?  This is my money.  I think  I make better decisions about my life, my health and my money than those  elected officials who have their heels dug in down in D.C.</p><p> FORBES:  Even a buffets of democrats, I'll trust him more than Nancy  Pelosi.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> Coming up, a big blow for Uber in Europe.  A new ruling says that the  company should be regulated like taxis.  What it means for drivers and  users of the popular ridesharing app?</p><p> Plus, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, reportedly taking another step in its effort to  buy the Carolina Panthers.  New details on how Colin Kaepernick might be  involved.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This breaking news overnight.  The E.U. dealing a major setback  to Uber.  Lauren Simonetti has the details.  Lauren.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Dagen, the European court of  justice ruling that Uber should be regulated as a taxi company and not as a  digital service.  Uber has been trying to use courts to reduce their  regulatory oversight.  Uber claims that I's an app, so it could connect  drivers with passengers that they pick up.</p><p> Uber adds that the ruling should not have an immediate impact on how it  operates in Europe.  Shares -- well, it's not a publicly traded company.   Or at least not yet.</p><p>UPS ordering 125 of Tesla's all-electric semi-trucks.  This is the largest  public order for the big, thus far.  The Tesla trucks will cost about  $200,000 each.  Tesla expects them to be in production by 2019.</p><p> This is where I'm going to show you shares of Tesla.  They're up 1.1  percent at 334.92 in premarket trading.</p><p> Well, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs or Diddy, that's what his name is these days,  serious about buying the Carolina Panthers.  Yahoo Sports is reporting that  Diddy is huddling with potential investors hoping to put together an  ownership group.</p><p> Those efforts are expected to include Colin Kaepernick.  He and Diddy,  according to the report had a conversation and they discussed the former  NFL quarterback's role in any potential deal.  Panthers' owner Jerry  Richardson announced that he would be putting the franchise up for sale  amid sexual and racial misconduct allegations.  Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you think?</p><p> KELLY:  I mean, I think it's pretty interesting.  Well, getting back to the  Uber situation that most of the rules and regulations that come on this  technology companies, whether it's Google or Uber or any other is coming  from Europe.  And I think that's going to be a big thing going into next  year.</p><p> I think there's going to be a lot of rules and regulations coming,  especially to Facebook.  So, I think that's pretty telling.  We're starting  to see the ripples now.  We'll feel the effects next year.</p><p> FORBES:  And also shows why Britain pulled out of the E.U. is that they're  very anti-growth, anti-innovation.  Always has this guild medieval  mentality of something new comes along, we have much pressure and control  it</p><p> And you're right though.  In this country, the big tech companies don't  realize they're going into a political buzz saw because of their alleged  power and they haven't done -- in the old days, back before any of you were  born, the old AT&amp;T monopoly survived as long as it did, because it made  sure everyone was serviced, everyone -- every politician got free phone,  not free phone service during the campaign.  But they got the phone  service, every newspaper and the net.  They covered all their bases.</p><p> These tech companies, especially Google discriminating against  conservatives on what they're allowed to post.  That stuff is going to get  a political backlash.  I wish they'd wake up to this.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that they are waking up. I think that they are waking  up, that they realized the power of Washington and what they -- what might  be brought to bear on them.</p><p> FORBES:  They're still playing with the conservatives.</p><p> KELLY:  They're the biggest donors to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, and  so they're actually enabling this.  And so they're kind of blinded by kind  of their friends in Washington that aren't really going to be there to help  them out.</p><p> FORBES:  They have to realize there are two parties in this country.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll see the reaction of this tax reform because it's going to  feel good to a lot of them.</p><p> Coming up, ISIS, threatening attacks here and in Europe over the holiday  season.  The latest target, New Year's Eve.  How officials here in New York  City are stepping up security a week after that subway bomb blast.</p><p> And the divide in the fight against opioid abuse.  The overdose antidote  helping victims, but it may also put law enforcement at risk.  The  controversy, ahead.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A new terror warning.  ISIS releasing several disturbing  propaganda posters threatening attacks over the holiday season.  The latest  target?  New Year's Eve.  This comes a week and a half after an attempted  suicide bombing in New York City.</p><p> New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo has announced tightened security measures  over the holidays including increased personnel, bomb sniffing dogs and  even radiation detectors.</p><p> Joining us this morning is national security analyst at the Clarion  Project, professor of counterterrorism at Liberty University down at  Lynchburg, Virginia, Ryan Mauro.</p><p> Ryan, what do you make of this?</p><p> RYAN MAURO, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, CLARION PROJECT:  Well, of course  ISIS is going to be saying something like this.  For me, what the message  should be is even if they were to succeed in carrying out an attack, the  so-called lonewolf for those doesn't actually exist.  One guy goes off and  he kill some people.</p><p> Overall, they're still a bunch of losers.  Ninety-six percent of their  caliphate has been destroyed.  We need to start weaponizing Trump's  trolling.  Make fun of them for how many dumb things that they do and for a  group that claims that Allah is blessing them and on their side, well,  actually it kind of looks like if they all exist, he's on our side because  we're really killing them.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  You know, Ryan, I think you make such a good point because ISIS  has lost ground in the Middle East, essentially what it's trying to  establish is a cyber-caliphate and so it's trying to influence people.   People who are crazy.</p><p> A lot of these people who are lonewolf attackers don't really have a real  attachment to terrorist groups overseas, as you know.  And instead what  they're trying to do is reach people who are angry, people who want to take  that anger and hate out on people and then essentially get to them through  the internet.</p><p> But when you look at terror attacks in places like New York City, these  lonewolf attacks, what's so difficult is trying to identify them ahead of  time.  So you have some 3,000 police officers patrolling down the subway  systems for example in New York each day.</p><p> What they're really having to be able to do is assess people.  So how can  people better be able to asses people or officers and just people on the  streets to see if maybe they're -- to have those assessments in mind in  case they see some something and then they should say something.</p><p> MAURO:  Sure.  Great question.  The average civilian is just looking at  something like a backpack that's place somewhere.  That's kind of obvious  thing that made you uncomfortable reporting that type of thing.  For law  enforcement, I do a lot of training of law enforcement and what I'll teach  them is look for these dramatic overhauls in someone's personality because  that's what the radicalization process looks like.  Obsession.  He becomes  obsessed with the ideology.</p><p> They usually start alienating their friends and family because they become  real judgmental.  But I would say that when you look into the backgrounds  of these folks, yes, they may not initially have connections to a terrorist  group, per say, but they will have connections to a supposedly nonviolent  extremist movement.</p><p> You look far back into where these initial ideas kind of incubate and  you'll see connections to groups around the world that are considered  moderate by comparison, but still radical in repulsive and that's where I  think our attention should and that's why I think that congress really need  to investigate how the Obama administration impeded counterterrorism  investigations and prosecutions because that's the foundation where this  begins.</p><p> It's not about political points.  It's about figuring out where these  mistakes were made and going back and fixing them.</p><p> FORBED:  One of the things that happen a few years ago is the New York  police department had a good intelligence operation and then politically  they forward it.  Is that back up to full speed again?</p><p> MAURO:  Not really.  Because what happens is when something like that  occurs, you influence the culture.  And so you can still have  investigations on the street level, but those specific programs that were  shut down, even if you were to revive them -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Muslim communities and mosques just trying to figure out if  there is a would-be terrorist where the individual was working, where the  individual might be living and basically in secret.  But do you think --  New Yorkers are angry.</p><p> New Yorkers are angry that in 14 months, we've had three terror attacks.   Eight people killed over near the Westside highway on a bike path and then  after the fact, they put up concrete barricades, some of which are  decorated for Christmas.  People are irritated, they're angry, they're --  you know what and what is New York going to do about it?</p><p> MAURO:  Well, there a few different programs that were conflated.  The  biggest amount of lying that went on in the media and also pushed by  certain activist organizations was this idea that the NYPD was just spying  on Muslims for simply Muslim.</p><p> If you look at the stuff that real resources were put into, there are  always indications of extremism such as classes on how to disarm police.   If you get into a fight with cops.  That's a sign of extremism.  Start  there.</p><p> Believe it or not, those type of indicators are all over the place and  that's where you start.  And if you look at this as an ideological  insurgency, not a criminal intelligence problem, not even terrorism  problem, but an ideological insurgency and you say what is the  infrastructure for this problem.  Start there.  You'll find the bad guys.   It just requires some political incorrectness.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ryan, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  Ryan Mauro.  Again,  be vigilant.  Be vigilant.</p><p> Coming up, Facebook expanding the use of its facial recognition, but it's  raising new concerns over privacy.</p><p> And do you have one of the most popular computer passwords of the year?   We'll tell you why that's not a good thing.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, December 20th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Clearing  the final hurdles to tax reform, the Senate burning the midnight oil to  pass the largest tax code overhaul in three decades, the votes split  straight down party line, not one single Democrat defecting in support of  this bill.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE:  I think every  Democrat who votes against this and apparently, that's all of them in the  House and Senate, are saying, in effect, we are satisfied of where we are.   They're simply not interested in doing the kind of things that economists  believe will get the country growing again.</p><p> REP. STENY HOYER (D), MARYLAND:  There was no inclusion of Democrats in  this process.  When the senator says, you know, we want to give tax cut,  frankly, we want to give tax cut as well.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The House will vote on the updated bill today, likely sending it  to the President's desk.  Optimism over tax reform still fuelling these  markets, futures are showing gains across the board, 75 point gain on the  Dow futures right now.  It has been an incredible year for stocks.  Dow was  down about 37 points yesterday, but we are seeing the optimism return.</p><p> In Europe, we have losses across the board in England, France, and Germany,  and seems like the sung is picking up a little bit of steam in France and  Germany right now.  In Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower as well, the  slight gain for the Nikkei in Japan.  </p><p> Tragedy in Mexico, a tour bus carrying American cruise ship passengers  crashes, killing at least 12 people.  We have the latest from that  investigation ahead.  The opioid epidemic striking the workplace, alcohol  and drug-related overdoses at work, spike to new levels, how the government  is working to combat that growing health crisis.</p><p> And putting the face in Facebook, the social media site sparking privacy  concern with new facial recognition technology, why the company says it  added the feature, ahead.  And these aren't the passwords you're looking  for, Star Wars make its debut on the annual list of the worst passwords, we  will let you know what took the top spot this year.</p><p> But to our top story this half hour, the opioid epidemic hitting the  workplace, according to a new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  unintentional drug and alcohol overdose deaths at work spiked 32 percent in  2016.  The number tripling since the bureau began compiling data back in  2011.  Joining us this morning is Opiant Pharmaceuticals CEO, Doctor Roger  Crystal, Doctor, your company develops the easy-to-use overdose antidote,  NARCAN, which is a nasal spray, so you're at the forefront of combating  this opioid epidemic.  What do you think of these new statistics?</p><p> DR. ROGER CRYSTAL, CEO OF OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS:  For me, given my  background, this really isn't a surprise, actually, unfortunately.  The  opioid crisis has just continued to grow.  I'm from the U.K., originally,  and trained as a surgeon and there are those types of numbers that don't  yet exist, but part of that, kind of, the big driver of that has been,  unfortunately, in the past.  The over-prescribing of opioid painkillers,  and that's something that we need to address as a country alongside  treating all of these people who are unfortunately addicted to opioids and  alcohol.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Aren't we already doing that in terms of really reining in the  amount of opioids prescribed.  I mean, I personally experienced it with all  my doctors, you have -- you have dental surgery, they do not give you  Vicodin any longer.  In terms of it, even at the state level, it's -- you  have -- it is very, very hard to get a prescription for anything as  powerful as, like, Oxycodone or Oxycontin at this point.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  That's true that there are some measures in place already, so I  hope we do -- we will see a reduction.  I will say that even recently as  last year, there were still over 200 million opioid prescriptions made out  to approximately 20 million people.  So this is a huge issue and that  doesn't also address the two and a half million opioid addicts who we have  in this country already.  So we are really not there yet, I'm afraid. . KELLY:  Yes, so getting back to your product and what you guys do, you guys  have a nasal spray that people that are currently addicted to heroin take  or can you explain to us the product and you've got FDA approval and, kind  of, walk us through what you guys are doing.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  So, the product is called the NARCAN Nasal Spray and this saves  lives if someone with overdose from an opioid.  And when we say opioid,  yes, correct, it is something like heroin or Fentanyl, unfortunately, we  see there now, but also, just routine normal painkillers such as Oxycontin  and Vicodin and was -- I agree that they are being prescribed less.  </p><p> They are still overprescribed, and it's not for someone who's even  necessarily an addict.  I'm in good health, I don't abuse opioids, if my  dentist were to prescribe me Oxycontin, I will still be at risk of an  opioid overdose (INAUDIBLE) prudent for me to be prescribed the NARCAN  Nasal Spray alongside any opioid as a -- as a just in case measure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to get to why you're talking about NARCAN.  There  was a report recently that police departments are split over the use of  NARCAN, that some police officials are talking about like a resources for  obtaining, maintaining and tracking supplies, and for training in and when  how to use it, are you seeing any pushback from police departments when  they encounter rescue squads, ambulance services, paramedics, when they  encounter people who have overdosed for them using NARCAN?</p><p> CRYSTAL:  The feedback from ourselves and from our partners adapt farmers  as well.  There's no real pushback in terms of not wanting to recede the  NARCAN Nasal Spray.  It's easy to use, it saves lives, it's been FDA  approved.  So there's a real gratitude when they finally can get hold of it  because actually, it's something that people are then able to use and save  lives, the challenge about resources that is more -- a broader issue about  funding.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's true for some, but I know that Sheriff Jones in Butler  County Ohio, does not want his officers carrying this and it's because for  one thing. They say that, you know, law enforcement officials are supposed  to be able to enforce the law, not end up, basically, treating people who  are going to overdose again and again, and they see these repeat offenders.  </p><p> You know, they also say that sometimes, people come to and they actually  assault the person who was trying to help them.  There was an incident  about in Middle town where an injured firefighter was injured.  And so you  look at this, and you go, a firefighter is supposed to be fighting fires,  yet, they do, you know, give emergency medical help as well.  But gosh,  like, should they be carrying this around and then being put in this  position where they are -- they are expanding their duties to something  that they really are not supposed to be doing?</p><p> CRYSTAL:  Well, that represents this issue, a vast minority of people and  certainly, the (INAUDIBLE) you mentioned is very outspoken and that's  particularly rare.  The emergency responders in general, that is their  chance (INAUDIBLE) overall is to respond to an emergency, why, to  ultimately save lives and this is -- this is a very successful way of  saving a life if given appropriately.  And people if they get the right  training, should absolutely be well-handled to do so. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Your company got some good news about feasibility of a heroin  vaccine that's getting worse.  Tell us about that.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  So this is an early stage program that we are very fortunate to  have partnered with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and neither  the National Institute of Drug Abuse, so we have this program and we got  some recent news that's going to be published around the feasibility of  this heroin vaccine.  It's showing that not only does the vaccine seem to  work in an animal model against heroin, but also, activity with some of  these opioid painkillers as well.  </p><p> We are encouraged by that.  We also have the data to show that this can  potentially be scaled up and therefore, truly manufactured on the  commercial level once it gets into the clinics, so this is very important  even at this stage, when we are thinking about this as a proper product to  get out there.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA:  Can we get a  balance in pain management as, you know, 15 years ago, the rap against  medical profession was they weren't doing enough people in pain which led  to for whatever reason we have the crisis today.  What is the balance?</p><p> CRYSTAL:  The balance is a tough one to strike.  And I talked about my  experience in the U.K. as a surgeon there.  And by no means is the U.K.  perfect at all.  We probably didn't prescribe sufficient analgesia.  The  balance, really, to think about how we address that is starting off with  medical schools, and I say, medical, not just the M.D. medical, but dental  schools and anyone else who's interfacing with patients who are in pain.   Pain just doesn't need to be addressed with painkillers.  </p><p> I think that's the first thing that's really important to think about here.   Often physical therapy can be extremely helpful and in fact, patients need  to understand that some pain isn't, in fact, a bad thing, if they are  reassured, psychologically, that this is part of healing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But the backlash has been toward, and I speak from personal  experience, family experience, that people who are in critical pain, who  need opioids, who need Oxycontin, who need Oxycodone, who are fighting  stage 4 bone cancer.  It is incredibly difficult now to get prescription  refilled, that you have to have, and the supplies -- they give you a very  short supply.  </p><p> But these are people who literally can't get addicted because of the pain  levels they're experiencing.  These are deadly diseases and they're just  trying to manage their pain, but it's incredibly difficult.  Now, for these  people to even -- to go -- you have to drive -- my mother has to drive two  hours to get a paper prescription from her doctor every couple of weeks,  literally.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  No, absolutely.  And that's very unfortunate and the fact that  people who generally do require opioids, potentially are finding harder to  get access.  I absolutely sympathize tremendously in that situation.  The  issue we have is the vast majority of people probably not to be on opioids  in the first place.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  I mean, that's what's so --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, there it lies the personal responsibility, I have  conversations with friends and family all of the time, that if a doctor  ever offers to give you an opioid, you say no, I just had tooth pulled, I  don't need Vicodin for that.  And people are hesitant now, I think, at  least through the communication through the media, people are hesitant to  take opioids at all because they know they're so highly addictive, I mean,  it doesn't take much for some people to become chronically addicted to the  point that they can't stop taking it.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  Absolutely.  And the issue that we have here is that not everyone  is so willing to challenge (INAUDIBLE) and actually, it's a multifaceted  approach.  So, it's the historical marketing of drugs, it's the fact that  doctors have been overprescribing, it's the fact that patients aren't as  empowered as perhaps they have been, so it's very difficult to say there's  one specific area of responsibility but recognizing we have this crisis.  </p><p> We need to do something about it.  Part of it is to stop the  overprescribing and misprescribing of opioids and for where we play a role  as a company, is to treat addictions themselves.  Anyone who is an opioid  addict, the sooner you can get on definitive medical care and the longer  you can receive medical treatment, the far greater the likelihood of not  relapsing and actually going into long-term recovery and that's what we are  committed to.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Doctor Crystal, it's good to see you.  Doctor Roger Crystal,  thank you so much for being here.  Coming up, Delta says, pay up, the  airline calling on officials at Atlanta's Airport for compensation after  the massive power outage caused Delta to lose millions of dollars in  revenue because thousands of flights have to be canceled.  And (INAUDIBLE)  shares of the popular online retailer, Stitch Fix, tumbling after its first  earnings report as a public company, the details are next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, futures reporting to a higher open, 78-point gain  on the Dow Futures right now.  </p><p> We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  Stitch Fix shares unraveling in  pre-market following its first earnings report since its IPO.  The  personalized apparel company reporting strong customer gains, but it only  narrowly beat profit expectations because of expansion costs.  The company  is also struggled to convince investors it can keep up the growth.  Shares  are down 12 percent in premarket trading.  </p><p> And can the Blackberry turn around continue?  The former smartphone giant  is set to report its third-quarter earnings before the bell today.   Analysts are expecting revenue of about $215 million.  The company has  recently pivoted away from phones to cybersecurity software.  Blackberry  shares are up nearly 60 percent so far, this year.  </p><p> 12 people are dead after a tour bus crashes in Mexico, Lauren Simonetti has  details, Lauren.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Such a terrible story, Dagen.  The bus was carrying cruise ship  passengers on an (INAUDIBLE) in Mexico when it flipped over on a narrow  highway yesterday, killing 12 people; 20 others injured, including seven  Americans.  Royal Caribbean says passengers from two of its ships were on  that bus.  Investigators now are working to go figure out what caused the  crash.  </p><p> Well, Delta wants some money back.  The airline is seeking to be repaid for  lost revenue after Sunday's power outage at Hartsfield-Jackson  International Airport in Atlanta.  Delta CEO Bastian says, the airline may  have lost between 25 and $50 million of revenue as a result, and he plans  to talk to both the airport as well as Georgia Power.  That outage caused  Delta to cancel about 1400 flights, and they also had to put stranded  passengers up in hotel rooms.  Hartsfield-Jackson is Delta's main hub.   Taking a look at shares of the company, this year up about 13 percent.  </p><p> And can you believe that in 2017 people are still using password as their  password?  Here is a list of this year's most common password.  We'll start  with number three: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, really, I swear.  And second place  is: password, for the fourth year in a row.  The most common password of  the year: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  I don't even know how this is possible.   Because many Web sites, at least the one I use, make you change your  password, and then you have to have the capital letter, the number, the  symbol that you can't remember it, so you're constantly changing it.   Anyway, for those of you who still use \"password\", we have new passwords  that you might want to change to.  None of these are good, but they are  popular: \"let me in\", \"monkey\", and \"Star Wars\", made to the list of the  most common new password.  Dagen, what are your passwords?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what, I can't even remember them.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I only know them on the QWERTY keyboard by the keystrokes.  But  it's never -- you're not supposed to actually use a word ever, no word in  the dictionary, there should never be a word in your password.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Impossible to remember.</p><p> KELLY:  Can I just say that hope that one of the brain trusts of the  Democratic Party John Podesta watch this segment, the password for his e- mail which WikiLeaks got was \"p@ssword\" and the \"a\" was the \"@\" symbol.   So, hopefully, he watches this -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I thought that was pretty classy.</p><p> KELLY:  He knows not -- hopefully he didn't change it to \"Let me In\", or  \"Monkey,\" or \"Star Wars.\" </p><p> FORBES:  I hope the used the password for Democrats, tax cuts.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And needed little @.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you put in #tax, if you're going to tweet, the first thing  that comes up tax cut scam.  And it just makes me so angry because it's not  a -- the Democrats weren't involved in it, that doesn't mean it's a scam.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> FORBES:  No.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  But that's good marketing.  </p><p> KELLY:  No, it's a scam when you get to keep more of your own money.  It's  ridiculous.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But all hat -- all hat no cattle, is what that is.  Good  marketing, yes.  Good words, no action.  Coming up, control or creepy?   Facebook's expanded facial recognition, which will alert you if your  picture is posted through the social media site even if you're not tagged  in it.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Facebook raising new privacy concerns.  The company expanding  its facial recognition technology, it will now alert you if your photo is  posted to the social media site even if you're not tagged in it.  But  Facebook has a different spin, Gerry Willis is here with the details.  I  don't think it sounds like the worst idea, actually.  </p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FBN HOST:  It doesn't, and they're not saying that at all,  that we're going to hurt your privacy.  In fact, they're saying 180-degree  the opposite.  Here's what they say, if someone uploads a photo of your  face to Facebook, the company usually knows that it's you, thanks to facial  recognition technology.  Facebook will now alert people that a friend or a  friend of a friend, whoever uploaded a photo of them, even they haven't  been tagged in the picture.  </p><p> This is what Facebook says, \"We're doing this to prevent from people from  impersonating others on Facebook.\"  Facebook says it has no plans to use  facial recognition to enhance ads targeting.  That's the first thing I  thought of, that this has something to do with advertising.  Like, sharing  you more news feed post from friends who post and tag photos of you, or as  related to locations where you appear in untagged photos.  </p><p> For example, if you're in somebody's profile photo, which is always public,  you'll always be notified.  For other photos, though, you'll only get  notified if you're in the audience for that photo so as to protect the  uploader's privacy, and not alert you about photos you're not allowed to  see.  Facebook says, the feature is designed to give people more control  and make them feel safer because that's the ultimate goal in this society  that they're, at least, that everybody feels safe.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, impersonation is a huge problem on Facebook.  And I had --  somebody came -- was on air with us years ago and literally took, I'm not  joking, more than 30 photos in the building of themselves, and they tagged  me in every single photo and I wasn't in one of them.  And it was like the  most bizarre thing.  And so, why would you do that?  This is way -- this is  another step in preventing some kind of nonsense like that.  </p><p> WILLIS:  If you're not convinced to this?  You can have it undone of your  Facebook.  There's a way to delete it so that you don't have to be part of  this if you don't want to.  But I see what you're saying and makes a lot of  sense for people who are worried about impersonation.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  In fact, delete it from people who are trying to impersonate  people.  In others words --</p><p> WILLIS:  It will just alert.  It will tell you that somebody -- so, Dagen  who've known.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  What I mean is that there's a way in your security options or  something to prevent it from being in effect?  So, for somebody who wants  to try to impersonate somebody else -- </p><p> WILLIS:  Go find those people.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  They can figure it out.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We will know that something is not right if something's up if  you start like, if I have a pimple on my face and I start getting ads --  no, I start getting ads for Clear Fill.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a proactive face watch.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Dagen, never gets a pimple. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, that's not true.</p><p> KELLY:  I think this highlight, though, the omnipotent power of Facebook,  whether you recognize it or not.  Because they know you're in the photo.   So, you know, whether you're tagged it's you -- they know who are, and  that's how they track.</p><p> WILLIS:  I gave up with privacy a long time ago.</p><p> KELLY:  You are the product.  That's what it is.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Not just that but it's a --</p><p> FORBES:  In a way.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In a way.  We'll leave it.  Gerri, thank you.  Gerri Willis.   Still ahead, cellphone use, a public health issue.  It's what health  officials in California are warning.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, December 20th.</p><p> Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> History making on Capitol Hill -- the Senate approving the largest overhaul  of our nation's tax system in 30 years early this morning.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  When we get this done, when  people see their withholding improving, when they see the jobs occurring,  when they see bigger paychecks, a fair tax system, a simpler tax code --  that's what's going to produce the results.</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  The American people  overwhelmingly oppose this bill, punishing or ignoring those who have too  little is a profoundly unpopular idea.  There will be a reckoning.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Eighty percent of taxpayers are going to get a tax cut in the  first year -- 80 percent or more.  There you go.</p><p> The House will vote on that bill later today, likely sending to President  Trump's desk to sign.  And the President says if the bill is approved,  there will be a news conference at the White House this afternoon.</p><p> With the reaction among investors, we have gains across the board -- 85- point gain on the Dow futures.</p><p> Let's go back just a few days.</p><p> Every single major market gauge in the United States closed at a record  high on Monday.  Dow, S&amp;P, Nasdaq, Russell 2000 small cap index, Dow  Transportation stocks even.</p><p> Over in Europe we have some selling to tell you about.  Losses in France  and in Germany, a slight gain on the FTSE 100.</p><p> In Asia overnight, the only market moving higher there was the Nikkei in  Japan.</p><p> Searching for answers in Monday's deadly Amtrak crash -- why investigators  are turning their attention possible driver distraction.</p><p> And cutting the cord, a new study shows Netflix has just as many  subscribers as cable television.</p><p> And then working into your golden years, why most Americans plan to hold a  job well into retirement.</p><p> And forget two all-beef patties, McDonald's unveiling the McVegan burger.   But you'll have to book a trip if you want to try it.  I might just do  that.  I give -- you know what, if McDonalds is testing this globally I  give it a double-thumbs up being a vegan myself.</p><p> Here to break it all down Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle; Benchmark  managing partner Kevin Kelly; and Forbes Media chairman and former  Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes who doesn't know anything  but work -- right?  I mean you enjoy your family but work is fun -- right?  </p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, work is fun especially when  you get to go to McDonalds and they -- they should change it from McVegan  to McDagen.  </p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, I love it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's hilarious.  By the way, can I tell a story?  You -- when  there was a Wendy's in the building after Forbes on Fox taped every Friday.   You took everybody to eat Wendy's every single Friday.  </p><p> FORBES:  It's my version of a spa.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, did you deep your fries in the frosty?   Did you do that at Wendy's?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You do that?</p><p> FORBES:  No.</p><p> KELLY:  No, ok.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I'm sorry -- that's disgusting Kelly.  Kevin -- not me.</p><p> KELLY:  It's a thing.  It's a thing.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's how we start the 7:00 o'clock hour -- taxes and ketchup  (INAUDIBLE). </p><p> Coming up this morning -- Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge  Napolitano; Louisiana Senator John Kennedy is here; former Republican  presidential candidate Herman Cain; and the administrator of the Small  Business Administration Linda McMahon.</p><p> You don't want to miss any of those find folks.</p><p> But first, Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration about to  deliver on their Christmas promise for tax cuts.  House Republicans set to  give their final approval of the tax reform bill today after the Senate  passed the plan overnight.</p><p> Republican leaders taking a victory lap after the vote.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-WI), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  After eight  straight years of slow growth and underperformance America is ready to take  off.  Stock market is up, optimism is high -- coupled with this tax reform  America is ready to start reforming as it should have for a number of  years.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Democrats have said that the American people will  remember this night.  I hope they do because we passed one of the most  important tax breaks in this country's history.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump tweeting after the vote, \"The United States  Senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut and reform bill.   Terrible individual mandate Obamacare repeal.\"</p><p> Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote.  If approved, there will  be a news conference at the White House, at approximately 1:00 p.m.</p><p> Joining us now is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  subcommittee on tax policy -- Illinois Congressman Peter Roskam.</p><p> Are you surprised that you guys got this done because I certainly am?</p><p> REP. PETER ROSKAM (R), ILLINOIS:  Well look, I live the happy life of low  expectations which is not a bad way to go through life.  But that said,  there's been a lot of folks who have been working on this for years.  I  mean this goes back to the time when Dave Camp was the chairman of the Ways  and Means Committee and then it followed with Paul Ryan as chairman and now  Kevin Brady has brought this to fruition.</p><p> So I'm heartened.  I think it's a foreshadowing of things to come in terms  of legislative accomplishment.  And I think it's a great sense of relief  that the country wakes up this morning saying hey, an institution that it  didn't have a lot of confidence in, that is the United States Congress, has  demonstrated a capacity to get something significant done that has an  impact on every American.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman though -- I will point out one thing that if you  look at these polls in the Wall Street Journal, for example, it's out this  morning that  despite the fact that 80 percent or more of households will  get a tax cut in the first year, 17 percent say their family will pay less  in taxes.  Only 17 percent versus 80 percent who will get a tax cut.  41  percent of Americans in the survey say the tax plan was a bad idea.</p><p> This has actually gotten worse in recent weeks.  I would argue that part of  the problem is that some of the ideas that did wind up in the final bill  were just lousy and process was confusing.  What do you say in terms of why  people don't feel better about this?</p><p> ROSKAM:  Well, the 1986 tax reform package went in front and President  Reagan signed that into law with polling at 18 percent.  So we're pretty  much on par there.  And I think the second thing is polls tend to be all  over the place.  We saw that in the last presidential election.</p><p> And then just going back to this notion of low expectations, this is not a  bad place to be because people are going to see tax relief even though  they're being told by some that they're not.  The business climate is going  to get better even they are being told by some people that they are not. </p><p> So this is one of these bills where the more people come to learn what it  is all about, the more pleased they are going to be.  And the tax relief is  cooked in here and it's incredibly significant.  So for people to come to a  conclusion that they're not going to get tax relief, particularly those in  the middle-income category, it's just not true and that's good news for  them. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, those some that you're talking about, Congressman, they're  Democrats.  They are people across -- they're people across the aisle.   Let's listen to some of the slamming that's been going on.  </p><p> ROSKAM:  Yes.  I was being a little bit gentle.  Yes, you're absolutely  right. </p><p> So the -- and I think they made a strategic mistake and they've approached  this in the same way that they approached the health care debate.  And that  was trying to intimidate the GOP not to do something.  And we were  determined to get something done.</p><p> GABRIELLE  Yes.</p><p> ROSKAM: So what they did was they went to hyperbole.  They went to  Armageddon language.  They went to things that were just so completely over  the top.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scam.  Right.  Congressman -- </p><p> ROSKAM:  Yes.  It's just not persuasive.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, let's listen to what some of those individuals were  saying.  Let's roll that.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SCHUMER:  The Republican tax bill is like pouring gasoline on a raging  fire.  And though the Republican propagandist may call its passage a  political victory, a year from now Republicans will be running away from  this bill in shame for voting yes.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think -- I'm going to hand the baton to Steve Forbes --  Congressman.  But I think the Democrats didn't think that the Republicans  were going to get this done.  And so they used this language and now they  are basically caught flat-footed -- Steve because people are going to get a  tax cut and they are going to have to argue that you keeping more of your  own money is a bad idea somehow -- which is balderdash.  But continue.  </p><p> FORBES:  Yes, Congressman -- in terms of looking at the future, can you  throw out some anticipation that this is a down payment for more tax cuts  to come if they retain Congress in 2018 -- 2019, revisit this and do more  tax cuts, so give people something to look forward to.  </p><p> ROSKAM:  Yes.  There's no question about it.  I mean the idea that tax  policy discussions stop at this point is absolutely not true.  So Steve --  you can look forward to this Ways and Means Committee and others continuing  to examine how to bring more tax relief up and down the spectrum.</p><p> And I think the other thing is, you know, the notion of the Democrats being  caught flat-footed I think is spot on.  They didn't anticipate this moment  when this bill is going to be signed.</p><p> And now they've got to be -- basically be arguing in the alternative.  And  they're arguing process.  They are arguing all other sorts of things.   Meanwhile we're just determined to bring the relief -- </p><p> FORBES:  Congressman -- one of the things that really tied you guys up in  knots I think unnecessarily were these projections from Congressional  Budget Office that underestimated the impact of tax cuts.  Had you consider  a lot of stuff that got you a lot of bad press.  can you really reform CBO  and get realistic projections for the future so you can do vigorous muscle- bound tax -- muscular tax cuts in the future instead of worrying about pay- fors and things like that.  Just do it.  </p><p> ROSKAM:  Yes.  So there's been some progress on that basis -- Steve.  As  you know, there's been a shift -- </p><p> FORBES:  But very little.  I know -- 2.6 percent.  We know they can do 3.5  percent, 4 percent in the American economy.</p><p> ROSKAM:  I know.</p><p> FORBES:  So you ask CBO to -- redo the models for CBO.  </p><p> ROSKAM:  Yes.  So you're right.  And you're criticism is a valid criticism.  </p><p> There has been a shift over the past few years to insist on dynamic scoring  from the CBO which is a good trend, but there's a lot of more work to be  done.  And in my view, there has been a yielding of congressional authority  to bureaucrats who are unelected, many of whom are in those offices that  yield - -that wield a great deal of influence over the process.  </p><p> FORBES:  But you guys control -- you guys control Congress.  Why don't you  just -- </p><p> ROSKAM:  Tell me about it.  </p><p> FORBES:  -- reform CBO.  </p><p> ROSKAM:  Hey, you will find no argument here, my friend.  I'm with you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you don't -- I guess the message from Steve Forbes,  Congressman, is you don't even get a victory lap.  The President hasn't  even signed this into law and he's like what's next, what's next.  </p><p> ROSKAM:  He's saying don't even -- don't even stop for a sip of water.  You  just got to keep going.  God bless him.  </p><p> FORBES:  You can have eggnog.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Eggnog.  He deserves some eggnog after all of this.</p><p> But you do still have business to get done.  Congress has until Friday to  pass a spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown before  Christmas.  House Republicans have been forced to cut back Defense  spending, the $81 dollar disaster aid bill has been broken out for separate  votes.  And the Senate plan to add Obamacare stabilization funds appears to  be dead on arrival in the House.</p><p> I know Lea Gabrielle has a question specifically about avoiding a potential  shutdown -- Lea.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  well, Congressman -- I want to ask you this.  I know one of the  issues that's been discussed on the budget caps, you know, I think in terms  of military and the navy says it wasted $4 million on continuing  resolutions since 2011, essentially put $4 billion in a trash can, pour the  lighter fluid on and burned it.  That's according to navy secretary.</p><p> They're saying that, you know, some of these incidents we are seeing where  sailors have died could be related to the military not being properly  funded.</p><p> So I would like to know -- I'd like to get an update on are you going to  have to pass continuing resolution or are you going to get these budget  caps lifted, what are you anticipating?  </p><p> ROSKAM:  Well, I'm anticipating that this gets done, to your point  continuing resolutions are miserable, what they are is just a continuation  of the status quo.  They don't take into account any changes in policy that  has been negotiated and passed by the larger process and it falls very  short.</p><p> But, look, as you know, this is s complicated institution with a wide range  of issues and s wide-range of perspectives up and down the line and very  complicated rules to navigate through.</p><p> I'm confident that the, you know, that the government is going to stay  open, I'm not necessarily confident that we won't continue to have a  continuing resolution of some point for some duration.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Military needs the continuing resolutions to stop.  Every  single military leader is saying that lives are on the line. Because of that.  And I jut want to make that clear. </p><p> ROSKAM:  Yes, there's no argument here.  I think they're right.  And that's  why the House of Representatives has produce 12 appropriations bill which  is hasn't happened in quite some time, so we have done the work and we need  to Senate colleagues to do the same.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well congratulations -- Congressman, because it looked close  there for a time.  But, again, Americans more than 80 percent of taxpayers  are going to get a tax cut in the first year more than 80 percent.</p><p> We make better decisions with our money, I think.  </p><p> ROSKAM:  Amen to that.  And I think that's a point that really deserves  focusing in on.  Somebody is going to make a decision about how this money  gets spent. And our views is it's better done in the private sector.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- Congressman Roskam -- good to see you.  Thank you  so much -- </p><p> ROSKAM:  Yes, thanks very much for having me on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Happy holidays.  </p><p> ROSKAM:  Merry Christmas.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  As speed seems to the leading factor in fatal Amtrak crash in  Washington state, now questions turn to why critical speed control  technology was not active on the train.</p><p> Plus the surprising new statistic about how many people have Netflix  compared to cable -- that's next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  New questions on the investigation into the Amtrak train  derailment in Washington State.</p><p> Lauren Simonetti has the details -- Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi -- Dagen.</p><p> Thorough investigators are trying to find out why that train was traveling  80 miles an hour in a 30-mile-an-hour zone when it went off the tracks,  killing three people and injuring dozens of others.  </p><p> One big question is why speed control technology was not in place to stop  the train automatically.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You are huge supporters of positive train control.  We  have all of our capital allocated to get it done and we've allocated the  capital and put all the resources on it.  There's no one that wants  positive train control more than Amtrak.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  The government says that technology must be installed by the  end of next year.  Investigators also say the train's engineer was training  a conductor at the time of the accident raising the question, was he  distracted.</p><p> Ok.  The battle between Netflix versus cable TV, heating up.  A new report  from PWC shows 73 percent of Americans subscribe to cable TV now.  So paid  TV -- that number is down from 79 percent a few years ago.  But it's the  same percentage of people that subscribe to Netflix. </p><p> The report is based on a survey of 2,000 consumers, you're looking at  shares of Netflix.  What a year for them -- up 51 percent.  Next year maybe  Netflix will take the lead.  We will see.</p><p> And did you guys see this, McDonalds targeting vegans not here in the U.S.   It never is.  It's always first in Europe, Sweden and Finland, that's where  they're selling a mixed vegan burger. It is made it's made out of soy, it  comes with tomato, lettuce, pickles, onion, ketchup on a sesame seed bun.  </p><p> It started as a trial back in October but a pretty strong response now,  they're making it a permanent menu item and hopefully bringing it to the  U.S.  I heard it tastes just like a real burger.</p><p> And take a look -- look at that chart, McDonald's on a tear this year, up  more than 40 percent.  Dagen -- I know you're into this.  Me, not so.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It doesn't tastes like a hamburger.  It just takes like  something made out of vegetables -- </p><p> SIMONETTI:  They've been sort of admitting that -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Vegetable sand toy.  But again, and you know, I'm not of that  thought, like, I just encourage people.  If everybody in the world ate a  little bit less meat and a little more vegetables, it would go such a long  way into, you know, saving lives of some animals in terms of like global  warming, even if people ate less meat.</p><p> You're laughing at me.  </p><p> KELLY:  Climate control -- Dagen.  Everybody </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I'm a carnivore.  I'm not even going there.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, but I don't.  But I don't -- what I'm saying is like I don't  freeze like Don't eat me.  Don't' eat me.</p><p> But if you eat a little bit less -- </p><p> FORBES:  Thank God for McDonald's.  That's the only way I eat fish, fish  fillet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You eat the fish fillet?</p><p> Forbes:  It's junk but -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, no, no.  I don't shame people.  I don't shame people for  what they eat.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I will say this about McDonalds, when so many people when  they're deployed in the military.  The first thing you want when you get  back is McDonald's hamburger and fries.  And I will tell you -- </p><p> FORBES:  Big Mac.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.  That stuck in my head when I was in Afghanistan.  So many  of us were like can't wait, especially the French fries so.  I don't know  that that has anything to your feeding.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, the French fries are vegan I think.  Or at least  vegetarian based on -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  When was the last time you had meat?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Six, seven years ago -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  It's a long time.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Something like that.  I've been a vegan for the last year.  So  there you go.</p><p> Coming up, California in flames -- the inferno outside Los Angeles now the  second biggest wildfire in state history.  How much ground crews have  gained after a break from high winds.</p><p> And working through your golden years -- why more Americans are choosing to  keep their jobs after retirement.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Working during your golden years -- an estimated 56 percent of  American adults plan to work in some capacity even after they retire.</p><p> Joining us to talk about this is Ramsey Solutions financial expert author  of \"Retire Inspired\" Chris Hogan -- who is in studio and I love it.</p><p> This makes sense not just financially, does it, Chris, I mean -- because  again like this is about health and wellness and really being -- happiness.  </p><p> CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS:  It really is.  Too many  people associate retirement with the end.  In my mind you start to looks  it, it's an opportunity to do more of the things you want when you want to  do it.  And so more people need to go into it with their eyes wide open  understanding what is my plan, what do I want to do and how am I going to  get there.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Go ahead.</p><p> KELLY:  Oh sorry -- so we hear retirement and people think 65 -- right.   But is that really even the case now?  I think when I start to see  retirement, it seems more like a 70, you know, it's starting to get to that  age range.  What is actual retirement and how should people start looking  at it?  </p><p> HOGAN:  Well, I talk about it in my book, \"Retire Inspired\".  Retirement  now has nothing to do an with an age, it has everything to with a financial  number.  So I'm trying to get millennials to really wake up and look at  this, start to utilize their 401(k)'s like never before which will put them  actually in a position to be able to retire in their 50s, right.</p><p> Instead of their having to work until they're y0 or 80.  unfortunately  retirement accounts are underfunded right now so people are going to have  to work longer and they'll have to work harder.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Go ahead -- Steve.  </p><p> FORBES:  No.  I was just going to ask How many people actually do real work  in terms of planning for retirement, not just financially but what are you  doing next when you wake up in the morning?  </p><p> HOGAN:  Such an important topic -- to be able to look at it and understand  what are you moving toward -- right, everybody knows they are getting away  from that job or that career.  But what's next?</p><p> And I talked with people.  Is it doing mission trips?  Are you starting to  give? Aare you starting a side business or maybe even consulting, a lot of  people have forgot about looking at how do you teach the younger generation  the things you've learned over the last two years or more.</p><p> FORBES:  A lot of are busy but there's not a real purpose to this but  things are connected.  </p><p> HOGAN:  Yes.  Now you're right.  And unfortunately a lot depression can  rise.  If people don't feel like they have a purpose.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think for so many people who are young the idea of being able  to retire sounds really good because I talk to so many millennials right  now who are having a hard time buying a house.  They're having a hard time  getting out from under their college loans.  </p><p> So what are sort of the steps that you put in place for young people to,  you know, to get through those repayments of loan and then to start really  planning for their retirements.</p><p> HOGAN:  Well, the first step is let's acknowledge. You hit the nail on the  head talking about student loan debt.  I mean the average person has 37,000  in student loan debt.</p><p> So what I want them to do to is to attack that debt.  I man with a  vengeance.  Get your money back -- you give yourself a raise when you get  out of debt.  Once you get yourself out of debt, then you can start to  build up an emergency fund.  </p><p> I want people to keep three to six months of expenses tucked away so when  light happens, you have money you can grab.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we were talking about retiring -- another reason to think  twice before you retired.  There's a new study that shows that 20 percent  higher mortality risk, if you claim social security at the aide of 62,  three years premature.</p><p> Why are you -- just take a shot of (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> HOGAN:  I know, I know.  I am.  I'm just doing this.  I'm just shaking my  head.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  The government comes after you.  That's amazing.</p><p> HOGAN:  I know I'm shaking my head.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Why?  </p><p> HOGAN:  Because mortality has to do with your health -- right.  So all of a  sudden now they've linked your health along with taking social security.   Listen, they are scaring people to death with things like this.</p><p> Some people didn't have enough put away, Dagen, so they're going to have to  take social security a little bit earlier.  It doesn't mean you're going to  pass away just because you tap in to social security.  Not at all.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I understand this though.  My grandfather worked and the day  that he stopped working he died within a year after that.  Of course, he  was in his 80s.</p><p> HOGAN:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But there is this.  I've known a lot -- a number of individuals  who continue to work and it was like they lost their sense of purpose.  And  maybe it didn't kill them but it certainly impacted their quality of life  and their mental health after they stopped working.  </p><p> HOGAN:  Well, Steve brought that up.  Talking about having something else  you're going toward.  Whether you're plugging in with charities, but you  have to do something you're passionate about.  You can't go and just sit on  the front porch for the next 15 or 20 years.  And the people have -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can.  I'm from the south.  I can sit on a porch all day long.  </p><p> HOGAN:  Dagen -- you would not sit on a porch longer than five minutes.   You are busy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's true.</p><p> HOGAN:  But you know, a lot of people I think when they start to think  about what can I do -- talking with other people, networking, and pursuing  some things that you're passionate about, it'll still keep you engaged and  excited.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick -- the tax plan can make people think twice about  where they spend their golden years.  Where are the best states for  retirement?  I've, always said pick a state that has low health care costs,  good access to health care, lower healthcare costs.  What do you say?  </p><p> HOGAN:  Well, I would say just do your homework so you can look at it and  understand.  Wyoming keeps popping up -- from health care costs, property  taxes.  I've been to Wyoming.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's cold.  </p><p> HOGAN:  It's cold.  You know, but -- </p><p> FORBES:  No state income tax.  </p><p> HOGAN:  No state income tax and Tennessee, Florida, Michigan -- all those  places.  But do your homework and understand where is your quality of life  going to be best.  And that's typically associated with where do you have  family -- right.  </p><p> When get older we want to spend more time with family and grandkids so know  those options.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You need people to take care of you, too.</p><p> HOGAN:  Well, you're not supposed to say that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I'm saying it.  I'm saying it your relatives are moving to  your awesome state of Tennessee, they are really hoping you're going to  help take care of them because they didn't save enough money when they were  younger.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  -- which is a good point, attack your debt when you are young,  right.  Because some one evil pays so much more for things like homes,  cars, et cetera because they get into debt.  </p><p> HOGAN:  That's right.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And that's one thing -- </p><p> HOGAN:  No, You're absolutely right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, I'm going to spring this on you.  One of the changes  in the tax bill, 401(k) borrowers have more time to repay their loan.  </p><p> HOGAN:  I know it.  Now listen.  I know but I want to get -- you're getting  me riled up -- Dagen.  But listen don't touch your 401(k).  You put that  money away to be able to live your dreams, don't tap into it, leave it  alone.  There are all kinds of penalties associated with it and it's not  worth the stress.</p><p> The way to grow money, Dagen -- you all know this, time and compound  interest. So let the money sit there and leave it alone..  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You still have to repay the loan if you leave the company by the  day you file your tax returns, used to be 60, you only had 60 days after  the departure.  I'm saving that argument for another day.  </p><p> Chris Hogan -- </p><p> HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I had to work that in there.</p><p> HOGAN:  Good to see you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.</p><p> HOGAN:  Thank you guys.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Happy holidays, my friend.

We do have video locked up  it for you. </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  You know who's on.  You can hear that laugh.  Your top  story this half hour.  Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe spent nearly eight  hours testifying behind closed doors yesterday for his role in the alleged  anti-Trump bias of the special counsel rush investigation.  </p><p> Now it appears that McCabe may be back for another round.  Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Oversight Committee Chairman Trey  Gowdy want McCabe and other senior FBI officials available for questioning  over the alleged anti-Trump bias in both the Clinton e-mail and Trump  Russia probe.  </p><p> And they're looking to interview them as early as this week.  Joining me  now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, peel back  this onion.</p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I wish I could  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Explain what's going on.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I wish I could peel back the onion, but it's difficult because  these interrogations keep taking place in secret.  </p><p> So we will soon have a Republican version of what happened when some  Republican decide to say we asked in this and they couldn't answer it.</p><p> And a Democratic version of what happened when they say we asked in this  and this is what he told us.  And the government will continue to treat the  American people as children rather than as the owners of the government  that we are where we have an -- we are entitled to transparency and to know  what happen.  </p><p> I hope that some courageous soul leaks a transcript of this, so we can see  what happened.  If Andrew McCabe misused government power, power we gave  him for partisan purposes, we are entitled to know it.  </p><p> If on the other hand, this is a stunt and inquisition by Congress to make  something look like something that it really isn't, we are entitled to know  that.  </p><p> We won't know it as long as they keep holding these hearings in secret.   The Republicans want to show that the FBI had an anti-Trump bias and  therefore, the Mueller investigation is tainted.  </p><p> The Democrats want to show that the FBI is not choir boys.  They always  have a bias against whoever they're investigating and you should expect  that from Mueller and everybody else.  </p><p> And let the courts worry about fairness.  The American people will decide  which version, if we ever find out what happened, they believe.</p><p> KELLY:  But will he really say anything?  I mean, it's behind closed doors,  but couldn't he say, hey, I need to differ?  Can he then take the fifth,  like what can actually come from this?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you can't selectively take the fifth, Kevin.  You have  to take the fifth on everything.  That's pretty much the law everywhere in  the United States.  I doubt -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even if he needs private grilling. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Somebody potential could come in and say I'm not going to answer  any of this question.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He could say, I'm not going to answer.  But he can't use his  right against self-incrimination as a reason.  He can use the following as  a reason.</p><p> The Inspector General of the Justice Department is investigating all of  this and he has asked us not to reveal what we told him until his report  comes out.  How do we know that that's a standard answer? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know how.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Where (INAUDIBLE) Rod Rosenstein -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- gave last week.  Now, they asked Rosenstein -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Chris Wray, didn't Chris Wray? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes.  This really -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The head of the FBI uses that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  So two Donald Trump appointees confirmed with heavy  majorities in the Senate, Rod Rosenstein, the number two person, the Chief  Operating Officer of the Justice Department.  </p><p> Chris Wray the Director of the FBI, and the Republicans that threatened to  hold the two of them in contempt.  When is the last time a Republican  Congress threatened to hold Republican appointees in contempt?</p><p> But here's the tantalizing thing when Rod Rosenstein, number two in the  Justice Department was asked last week, did the FBI pay for the Steele  dossier?</p><p> His answer was, I know the answer and I'm not telling him.  I'm pulling my  hair out at this point, because we've all been trying to find this out.  </p><p> That probably the type of answer that Andrew McCabe gave last night.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even with a -- he was there behind closed doors for eight hours.   Is there -- is -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Was a long time.  They didn't start at 2:00 in the afternoon  which is why they went until 10:00 at night.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is there any way -- there's no way you can read into the time  that he spent behind closed doors, because they could have just been asking  questions he might have been saying all -- about load of nothing.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, in my tradition, Steve, is familiar with this one,  when a question is asked that is improper, somebody says, objection and the  judge rules on it.</p><p> That is not the procedure here.  Each member of Congress gets five minutes  first round, five minutes second round, five minutes third round.</p><p> They can ask whatever they want.  Somebody else can object, they still get  to ask it.  So we don't know how aggressive the questioning was, and we've  (INAUDIBLE) until the transcript is leaked.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN &amp; EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA:  So what's your  saying is, they're not going to do anything until the Inspector General  report it Department of Justice comes out.  When is that going to come out?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Spring.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, we don't know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  April?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We don't know.  Probably, the spring.  But I don't know that  they're going to do anything even then.  I don't think they want to do  anything until Mueller is concluded.</p><p> He's either going to indict more people or exonerate some people.   Exonerate the president then his efforts become a footnote in history.</p><p> If he charges the president with something, it's a whole new can of worms.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are we going to get full exoneration from Mueller?  Will he  given -- will he -- what -- because again -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- is how you say it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know the answer to that.  I tend to agree with Steve.   I doubt it.  He wants to justify his existence.  But here's something  tantalizing, today is Wednesday, tomorrow Thursday, Bob Mueller personally  meets with President Trump's lawyers.  </p><p> What the heck are they going to talk about?  First, face-to-face meeting  during this investigation.  These are the people who told the president in  August, don't worry about it, it'll be over by Thanksgiving.  Over by  Thanksgiving.  It's Christmas and it's still heating up.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Judge, you're being pretty hard on this close session and this  close meeting.  But when you look at the organization like the FBI,  intelligence organization, the FBI is an intelligence organization like the  CIA.  </p><p> In order to have Congressional oversight, they have to have close meeting,  because things like sources and methods of how they do their investigation,  how they obtain things has to be able to be kept secret.  So don't you see  some volatility of that? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're so good and so pro-government.  So does the government  work -- </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  No.  I am -- I am pro -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Does the government work -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I am pro -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- (INAUDIBLE) they work for the government.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  -- (INAUDIBLE) our government employees who have dedicate their  lives to serving our country -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  -- intelligence community -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  -- to supporting them and helping them do their jobs properly.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So you trust -- </p><p> FORBES:  But that gets to your point, release the transcript and redact  process -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  (INAUDIBLE) don't leak.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, this is why such a successful -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Leaking is a crime.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Such a successful business -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Redacted.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- he can negotiate anything.  In fact, common ground between  us right here.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  We have lots of common.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We are not talking about the entire Intelligence community.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're talking about Peter Strzok who clearly had bias -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- maybe he's acted on that bias -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- which is illegal. </p><p> GABRIELLE:  No.  But you're talking about things like how -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  In his role -- but in his role investigating -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- Hillary Clinton, in his role investigating Donald Trump and  the transition, and the campaign.  That's what people are angry about.</p><p> It's -- we just want to get to the bottom of it.  We just want to -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  you know -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- know why would -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Fair not redacted, not leak.  Thank you for that (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, look, we do want to get to the bottom of it.  But the  American public needs to know that FBI ints are not choir boys.</p><p> If they were, the bad guys would run all over us.  We don't want them to be  choir boys.  They're entitle of the same political opinion as the rest of  us.</p><p> I'm not a friend of Strzok.  I've never met him.  And I'm not going to  defend him.  But if all of those text messages came out, you'll see as many  against Eric Holder.  He's (INAUDIBLE) at that time -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's true.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- as he did against candidate Donald Trump.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's true.  There are -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's the guy with a lot of opinions. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- kept messages -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- that -- </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Like the rest.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Just always -- I'll just remind people if you ever talk to  the FBI they can lie to you but you can't lie to them, and they will throw  you in the hoosegow.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Just ask Martha Stewart (ph). </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure, guys.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  Coming up, protecting passengers in  driverless cars.  Waymo working with an insurance startup that'll cover you  in case of an accident in an autonomous vehicle.</p><p> Cell phone use, a public health issue.  That's what health officials are in  California are warning.  The details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Firefighters in Southern California bracing for a new round of  powerful winds.  Lauren Simonetti has the details.  Lauren?</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  The Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa  Barbara County is now the second largest wildfire in California history.  </p><p> It's been burning since December 4th.  The good news is it's 55 percent  contained, because they had a few days of calmer wind. </p><p> Those strong winds are expected to return tonight.  Fire officials do not  anticipate full containment until January 8th.  Thousands of people still  under evacuation orders.  </p><p> Well, South Carolina's capital City of Columbia is banning bump stocks.   Their new law bans the attachment of these devices weapon in city limit.  </p><p> The device can turn semiautomatic rifle basically into machine guns.  And  they drew national scrutiny after they were found to be used in the Las  Vegas shooting rampage in October.  </p><p> The insurance industry adapting to driverless cars.  Waymo is teaming up  with a startup called Trov to cover passengers in autonomous vehicle.</p><p> Trov will insure rider for property damage as well as for injury.  Waymo,  of course, plans to launch their ride-hailing service in Phoenix in 2018.</p><p> Taking a look at shares of Alphabet which is the parent company of Waymo,  up over 30 percent this year.  Well, it might not had been as big an  explosion as the first one.  But the second one got the job done.  </p><p> We're showing you video.  Early this morning where you could see the  remaining pieces of the Georgia Dome coming down.  You guys remember when  the dome was first imploded last month and two sections did not fall?</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> And then who can forget this when the city bus, yes, there it is, the MARTA  bus blocked the view of onlookers.  I mean, this was history being made.  </p><p> So I think they had some better luck today.  But, of course, not so much  drama.  Hi, bus.  Now, get out of the way.  After the Georgia Dome was  already imploded.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love it.  Thank you.  I never get enough of that video.  Thank  you, Lauren.  Coming up, they promise to be healthy but are they safe?  New  detail on the government crackdown on homeopathic remedies.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The California Department of Public Health has a message for  cell phone users.  A new study shows long-term cell phone use may cause  health risk from radiation exposure.  </p><p> Joining us in this morning is family medical doctor Mikhail Varshavski.   Dr. Mike, are cell phones are health threat?</p><p> MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, DOCTOR, OVERLOOK MEDICAL CENTER:  Well, what I like  about that study is that it said may cause pose a threat.  And that's a  very important word that we focus on here, because we don't have definitive  proof that they cause health harm, at least physical health harm.</p><p> We know mental risk with cell phones definitely exist for people sitting on  social media, for people that stay up late at night using their cell  phones, but we're talking about physical risk here.</p><p> I'm really proud of the California Department of Health, because while they  say that it's not certain that there's health risks, there are steps you  could do to mitigate if that risk does exist.  </p><p> And there are simple steps.  Don't kip your cell phone in your pocket if  you're not using it, keep it a few feet away from you; don't sleep with the  cell phone underneath your pillow, because that extra radiation exposure  that you don't need.  </p><p> So it's really practical advice, there's no side effects to following this  advice.  It just smart all around.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you know it'll be taken a step further.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's -- for years, people have preached me that -- you know,  that you get brain cancer -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- from using a cell phone.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  My mom has been concerned about this for long time.  So I'm  just going to move my cell phone away from me and put closer to Kevin  Kelly.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Yes.  Give me all the radiation.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Well, it's important to know the different types of radiations  that exist.  So when you get a CAT scan or an x-ray, that's ionizing  radiation.</p><p> That's the radiation that if given large doses or overtime will cause  cancer.  That's proven.  Non-ionizing radiation which is the radiation  that's admitted by your cell phone, generally is safe.  </p><p> So that's why we don't make a big deal about the radiation that's admitted  by cell phone.  Because Wi-Fi releases the same thing.  </p><p> And now, Wi-Fi is all over the city.  So we tend to not get too excited  unless we have definitive proof here.  Because think about the health  benefit that come from using cell phone, in an emergency situation -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  -- or doctor's communicating with each other?  I mean, I'm on  my cell phone talking to my patients, to the ER, to other doctors all the  time.  So -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So Dr. Mike, my theory is good news.  But let's move on to some  -- a spoonful of sugar no longer advised to help the medicine go down.</p><p> The Food and Drug Administration is cracking down out on homeopathic  remedies targeting those with potentially harmful ingredient.  What's your  stand on this?  I get this, because again, this is, kind of, a very  unregulated area of the world or, you know, even vitamins for example.  </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And people misuse them.  This -- we talk about doses being way  too high.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.  So I'm not a fan that the FDA doesn't regulate vitamins  in the supplement industry.  However, homeopathic medications are  medications.  </p><p> They're not just vitamins.  So these are actively toxic substances that are  being prescribed to people by homeopathic practitioners, they're not  doctors.  And some of those toxic substances cause illness.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Like what?</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Belladonna.  It's a poisonous plant that creates a poisonous  berry is given to children that are teething and have resulted last year in  400 injuries and 10 deaths.  This is -- </p><p> KELLY:  Is this cleared by the FDA or not cleared by the FDA?</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  So -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They can -- go ahead.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  This is a very important distinction here, the homeopathic  medicines are technically supposed to follow the same approval process as  any prescription drug out there.  </p><p> However, 1988, they created distinction that gives the FDA some flexibility  in not enforcing all of these policies.  Now, they've realized that they've  gone too loose for too long, and there's harm coming from this.  </p><p> Not only our patients ingesting substances that are dangerous for them, but  some are forgoing good medical care that will help them, that has proven  benefit in order to get homeopathic care.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Is the FDA tracking down on based of the advertising of these  homeopathic drugs or medicines or is it just trying to more, like, limit  the access to it?</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  So it's both, it's advertising, the way that the product -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Advertising, they have like the FCC has -- </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  FCC, yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The FCC can crackdown on any kind of false advertising -- </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- regardless of who's doing it.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Well, the FDA, what their job is to make sure that medications  don't get approved for a certain subject.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  OK.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  So if -- there are so many of these substances that are out  there, because they're all considered natural.  And again, for those of you  at home, natural does not equal healthy.  Arsenic is natural -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you can take too much vitamin D and wind up -- </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- wind up with a face flush.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Exactly.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Quite, frankly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  And last thing, I have to say for doctors, while we know that  homeopathic stuff right now has not been proven.  We have to keep an open  mind -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  -- because pathologic disbelief doesn't help anybody.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  Dr. Mike, love it.</p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Still ahead there are so many animals who need good homes.   That's Ramon and Charlie.  We can tell you how you can adopt and rescue an  animal.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I'm picking Charlie.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Next hour.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

The Senate making history, Republicans approving the largest  overhaul of our country's tax system, moving the bill one step closer to  President Trump's desk.  The House will vote on t his bill later today.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES:  And when people see the withholdings go down in February  when they see their tax cuts, that's going to change the view of this  because it's going to give us better jobs, higher wages, bigger paychecks  and a simplified system and people are going to get their taxes cut.   That's good for everybody.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump says if the bill is approved there will be a  news conference at the White House this afternoon.  Futures are showing  gains across the board, an 89-point gain on the Dow futures, we could wind  up with record-highs on all year major market gages.  Watch the NASDAQ  Composite, maybe it hit that 7,000 mark.  In Asia -- In Europe, let's go  over there, losses to report in France and Germany, and in Asia overnight,  stocks mostly lower as well, the Nikkei the sole gainer there.  </p><p> Tragedy in Mexico, a tour bus carrying American cruise ship passengers  crashes killing the least 12 people.  We have the latest from that  investigation ahead.  Uber hit hard in Europe, the E.U.'s top court ruling  at the ride-sharing company is a taxi service and should be regulated as  such.  We break down the major implications of this ruling.</p><p> Plus, show them your grill.  The new ordering technology one burger chain  is using that could have the big name playing catch up.  Get that?  Catch  up.  And move over William Wallace, why residents in one luck U.S. town are  set to become lords and ladies of Scotland.  We have a Scotsman here this  morning.  Steve Forbes, also Fox News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle,  Benchmark managing partner, Kevin Kelly.  Forbes media chairman, former  Republican Presidential candidate.  All around awesome dude.  Steve Forbes,  a Scotsman.  </p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Call me my lord.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because you always make -- can I say this?  You always make  jokes about your brother because he regifts things at Christmas.  </p><p> FORBES:  Oh my god.  </p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen just made that up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I didn't.</p><p> FORBES:  No she didn't.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I didn't.  No, his brother --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  His brother is notorious for regifting things because again,  that's kind of the Scotsman in you guys.</p><p> FORBES:  Wow.  It's called recycling.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Recycling.  Excuse me.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You said that on air.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: It's actually putting --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KELLY: It's actually putting goods and services at its highest and best  uses.  So you're actually just redeploying them to their best use, right?   I mean, that's the capitalist.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anybody who denies regifting doesn't. </p><p> KELLY:  I just have to say one thing real quick about the market, we talked  about the futures.  I just want to say that next year I think we're going  to see record-breaking highs off of this tax reform package that goes  through. A lot of the Wall Street analyst have not put it in their  estimates for next year, so we will see once they revised those estimates  we will see the stock market go higher.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just from -- just from that and we'll move on to that.  Just  from the corporate tax cut.  Tony Dwyer yesterday says there is a 15  percent additional gain in the S&amp;P just based on the earnings that are  added to those S&amp;P 500 companies.  So --</p><p> FORBES:  So we don't need to regift next year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.  No excuses.  </p><p> KELLY: Yes, my lord.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Christmas 2018.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I didn't give anything away, I -- you said that on air before.   Joining us -- this morning.  </p><p> FORBES:  I know about it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Republican Presidential candidate Herman Cain, Small Business  Administrator Linda McMahon, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  You  don't want to miss any of these great terrific people.  But first, on the  verge of a tax victory.  Republican set to give their final approval to a  sweeping tax overhaul today after the Senate passed the plan overnight.   House leaders scheduled a final vote this morning on the plan sending it to  the President's desk to sign and law shortly.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell says, both American businesses and individuals will see the  benefits. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  We had three -- two  quarters in a row of three percent growth. Stock market is up, optimism is  high, coupled with this tax reform, America is ready to start reforming as  it should have for a number of years.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President congratulating lawmakers on Twitter writing this.   The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut and  reform bill.  Terrible individual mandate, Obamacare repealed, goes to the  House tomorrow morning for final vote.  If approved, there will be a news  conference at the White House at approximately 1:00 p.m.  Joining us now  from Capitol Hill, member of the Senate Judiciary and Budget Committee,  Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana.  Senator, assuming the House passes this  bill this morning which it already passed -- it already passed it and there  was change slightly.  When do you expect the President to sign this?  </p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Quickly as he gets it.  It's what he's  told us because I think he believes as I do that this is -- this bill is  going to have a breathtakingly positive impact on the American people.  I  mean I wouldn't have voted for it if I thought otherwise.  Duh.  You know,  I mean -- and look, I know the Democrats are against it.  But you can  explain if their opposition very simply.  There are two groups of people up  here in Washington and maybe two groups of the media.  There are those who  believe that you and I, people can spend money they earn better than  government and then there's a second group that believes government can.   And most of my Democratic colleagues, god bless them and think,  well, we  all just give all of our money to government because government is smarter  than we are and they can make better decisions.  And I don't believe that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Senator, Steve Forbes is here.  He has a question for you.  </p><p> FORBES:  Senator.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  I read -- I read your magazine, Mr. Forbes.  </p><p> FORBES:  We (ph) have that bright look about you.  Thank you.</p><p> KENNEDY:  I'm joyed. </p><p> FORBES:  But on -- one of the criticisms of the tax bill is that the  individual cuts many of them expired whereas the business ones seem to have  eternal life.  How do you -- how do you answer that and how are you going  to cure that next year, the year after we can take these expire dates off  of these tax cuts?  </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, I answer it this way, Steve.  That's only half the story.   I mean, on the one hand, the Democrats have said, you don't care about the  deficit.  Well, why do you think we didn't make the personal income tax  cuts permanent?  Because we were living within our means, the $1.5 trillion  guardrail.  Now, President Bush's tax cuts were \"Temporary too\" and they  became permanent after they were rolled over.  The personal income tax cuts  when they supposedly expire in 2025 will never expire.  They will be rolled  over.  So, our critics on that part of the bill are a little disingenuous  in my opinion.  </p><p> FORBES:  Is there -- are you ever going to get to a time when you're going  to finally shuck off these self-imposed restraints of CBO when we know  their numbers like their low -- their estimates, the tax cuts really don't  work for the economy.  We know those numbers are fake, why do we still them  as if they're gospel truth.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, I read the CBO report, I mean, I listen to CBO and JCT and  NBA and I read all their reports.  But there -- in some cases persuasive  but for me, they're not dispositive.  I have found in the last eight years  as the American economy has gotten more sophisticated, it does by the day  and we're part of the global economy that for every economist there is an  equal opposite economist and often times are both wrong.  Now I have -- I  have --</p><p> FORBES:  The average -- the average American growth rate is about 3 and  third -- 3-1/2 percent.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  Yes.  </p><p> FORBES:  CBO have 1.9 or 2.6 you raised it too from these crazy estimates.   Why don't you just put in 3-1/2 then you have all these more glorious tax  cuts.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, the recent uptick in our GDP I think has been a result of  two things.  First, it's been in (INAUDIBLE) people and business people and  especially I'm looking forward to the tax cuts so they can invest more in  their business.  The second reason that I think we have same uptick is  because President Trump has -- Trump has done an extraordinary job of  getting rid of some of the rules and regulations.  President Obama added  about $122 billion, not million, but billion of new regs and we're rolling  them back.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Senator, but I do -- I do want to get to this issue because it's  like a lot of the Senators that really in this tax reform plan, you stuck  it to us folks in the blue states, in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,  and out in California.  If you look at the popularity so far there is a  Wall Street Journal poll that's just out, 41 percent of Americans say the  tax plan is a bad idea.  Only 17 percent of people believe that they're  going to get a tax cut.  And Mike Block who is on this show very often e- mailed me and he said, listen, it's -- a part of it is because people in  red states keep talking about places like New York being -- </p><p> KENNEDY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- that we're getting a handout from people in terms of the tax  code and there's a limitation now only $10,000 on the state and local and  property tax deduction.  And so, they are not feeling like they're going to  get any benefit from this despite the fact that the numbers show 80 percent  of Americans will get a tax cut in the first year.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, let me -- let me answer your question straight-on.  I think  -- I think the American people are very smart.  They may not read Aristotle  every day but they're smart.  The reason they don't know every provision in  the tax code is because they're too busy earning a living.  I mean, they  can't sit and watch T.V. all day and learn about this stuff.  It's  complicated.  I've spent over 300 hours working on this bill.  But I think  once American people learn more about it and once American people have the  higher take-home pay and see their business growing and see their employer  growing, I think they're going to feel very good about this and in terms of  -- if I can just finish.  </p><p> In terms of the so-called high-tax -- high state and local tax states,  California, New York, New Jersey, yes.  For some people, if you're making  500 grand a year and you're paying property taxes for $35,000 to $40,000  thousand, you're going to pay more.  You are -- and we tried to soften to  blow by reducing the top marginal tax rate down to 35 but there's just no  way you can -- you can make everybody happy when you do legislation this  massive.  I mean, not only did we do the tax bill, we affected Obamacare,  rolled back some of it, we did and we're drilling.  This is a very broad  deal.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick.  Are we going to shut down you think?  </p><p> KENNEDY:  I don't want to shut down.  I will vote to shudder down in a  heartbeat if they try to make me swallow something that I don't think is  good for America or good for my state but I don't think that's going to  happen.</p><p> FORBES:  Senator, what's this -- we read about the dispute, the alleged  dispute between you and Don McGhan at the White House over judicial  appointments.  Can you enlighten us on that?  </p><p> KENNEDY:  I wouldn't read everything, I believe everything you read.  I'm  doing my job as a member of the Judiciary panel.  And when somebody -- let  me put it this way.  I thought my questions of Mr. Peterson were very fair.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We should -- Senator, we should just explain to folks who don't  know the story.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  OK.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That it was one of President Trump's judicial nominees, Matthew  Peterson withdraw his name from consideration after he struggled to answer  some pretty basic legal questions that you posed him.  Posed to him during  the Senate hearing.  Let's just watch a little quick piece of video of that  exchange.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KENNEDY:  Have you ever tried a jury trial?  </p><p> MATTHEW PETERSEN, TRUMP JUDICIAL NOMINEE:  I have not.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  Civil?  </p><p> PETERSEN:  No.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  Criminal?  </p><p> PETERSEN:  No.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  Bench?</p><p> PETERSEN: No.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  State or Federal court?  </p><p> PETERSEN: I have not.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  As a trial judge you're obviously going to have witnesses.</p><p> PETERSEN: Yes.</p><p> KENNEDY:  As a trial judge, you're obviously going to have witnesses.  Can  you tell me what the Daubert standard is? </p><p> PETERSEN:  Sen. Kennedy, I don't have that readily at my disposal but I  would be happy to take a closer look at that.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  Just for the record, do you know what a motion in limine is?</p><p> PETERSEN:  I would probably not be able to give you a good definition right  here at the table.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KENNEDY: Do you know what a motion in limine is?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Senator, please continue.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, I was just going to say, Mr. Peterson is a good guy, I read  his FBI background report.  But if you got a brain beyond a single cell  organism and you got a law degree and you've got any experience whatsoever,  you know what the Daubert case is, some call it Dover, in Louisiana we say  Daubert.  And I think Mr. Petersen is good election law, very good  apparently but he's not a trial lawyer and he's not qualified to sit on the  federal bench especially not in D.C.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Senator, thank you so much for being here.  We covered a lot of  ground.  Senator John Kennedy, take care.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Merry Christmas.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Happy holidays.  You did deliver a Christmas gift for folks.  We  just don't feel it for a couple months I think.  Thank you, sir.  Coming  up.  Another roadblock for Uber in Europe.  Details on the new ruling that  hit that ride-sharing giant overseas.  And the lords and ladies of  Connecticut, why Scotland is giving residents a one small town their own  land.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A tour bus crash in Mexico leaves at least 12 people dead  including several Americans.  Lauren Simonetti has the details.  Lauren?</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: The bus was carrying crew ship passengers,  Dagen, on an excursion in Mexico when it flipped over on a highway  yesterday, killing at least 12 people, 20 others injured including seven  Americans.  Royal Caribbean cruise line says passengers from two of its  ships were on that bus.  And investigators are working to determine the  cause of the crash.  </p><p> Well, the E.U. dealing a major setback to Uber.  The European court of  justice is ruling that Uber should be regulated as a cab company and not as  digital service.  Uber has been trying to use the courts to reduce its  regulatory oversight claiming, hey, we're just (INAUDIBLE) that connects  the driver to the passenger.  They also add the ruling should not have an  immediate impact on its European operations but it does raise the questions  about to get the economy going forward.</p><p> Well, Bank of America now offering paid sabbaticals to some of its  employees at their global banking and markets decision.  You can take time  off between four and six weeks and get paid for it.  In addition to your  vacation time, if you worked at the bank for at least a decade.  Employees  can use this sabbatical for an opportunity to travel or recharge, whatever.   But some bankers fear, look if we take this extra time it could cause  promotions.  Shares of the bank are up 33 percent this year.  I'm still  thinking about it.  Would I take a sabbatical?  I've been here 1- years,  Fox.</p><p> All right.  (INAUDIBLE) ladies.  Residents of Scotland as in Connecticut  are becoming just that, lords and ladies.  The Scottish land preservation  company gifting all 1700 residents in the town one square foot of land on  its nature reserve.  That comes with the courtesy titles of lord and  ladies.  The company sells forest lands so they cannot be developed and  these residents have to call town hall to get their free plot.  I'd do it.   Like there is about two hours from Greenwich, anybody nearby?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I am.  I'm Scottish descent sort of.  </p><p> FORBES:  Sort of?  What about access to your one square foot?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I don't know if I can -- I could fix -- </p><p> FORBES:  That was the answer, there was a serial that gave you a deed  inside the serial box to one square inch of land in Canada, then they got  in trouble because you couldn't actually (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love that.  I'm glad -- I love that.  I love that you're here,  Steve.  Coming up.  Revving the economic engine.  Former Presidential  Candidate Herman Cain tells us how he expects tax reform to impact the  economy.  And say cheese of fast-food giant comes up with a new way to  order a burger that will put a smile on your face.  And spend the holidays  with your new best friend.  That's my Charlie.  That's Charlie dog.  We're  going to tell -- talk to animal care center here in New York City about  finding a dog a home just in time for Christmas.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  To our top story, lawmakers on the verge of putting sweeping tax  reform on the President's desk.  Will this plan help grow this economy?   Our next guess says this tax bill stimulates economic growth.  How much?   He is here to tell you.  Former Republican Presidential Candidate, Fox News  Contributor, Herman Cain.  Herman, how much will the -- how much can this  plan -- as it stands, about ready to be signed in the law juice this  economy? </p><p> HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I believe that it can generate GDP  growth of three percent plus.  We just don't know how much plus.  But I'm  confident that it will do that.  Steve Forbes, one of your panelists also  knows this because of his business background.  Remember I was on a board  of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in the early 1990's.  We  routinely saw GDP growth of four percent and higher.  When the tax breaks  were right and when businesses were excited.  That's what this tax  legislation does.  It continues the excitement and momentum of the business  community and that means they are going to look at growing their  businesses, they're going to look at reward in their employees and they are  going to look at rewarding some of their stockholders.  </p><p> KELLY: Herman, it's Kevin Kelly.  I completely agree with you.  I think for  the past 25 years, the American economy has been hampered by a 35 percent  rate and you've seen corporations start to shift their business services  overseas to go to lower corporate tax rates.  They have trillions of  dollars there because of it.  One of the arguments I'm hearing that's very  popular coming from typically the left side is that, listen, this isn't  really going to translate to increased wages, this, you know, we're already  at a three percent GDP for it.  How long do you think it takes effect and  do you think this can raise wages going forward because we're starting to  hear arguments on the other side that incorporations aren't going to  increase wages?  </p><p> CAIN:  Those arguments are false.  And here is why.  50 years, I have been  in the workforce.  I have served on five corporate boards.  Let me tell you  what that priorities are.  Number one, grow that business.  Number two,  take care of the better-performing employees, and number three, reward the  stockholders.  Now, given those three top priorities, I have never sat on a  board and asked Steve Forbes the same question, where they talk about  getting smaller or staying stagnant.  Those arguments are absolutely false  and they simply want to ignore the facts.  You know, Kevin, there used to  be an old saying, you know, facts don't lie and liars use facts.  Today,  it's facts don't lie and liars don't even bother to look at the facts.  So  that's why they are making these erroneous statements because they know  that some people are gullible enough to believe it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Steve.</p><p> FORBES:  Herman, Steve Forbes here.  Merry Christmas, happy New Year and  all of that especially the tax cut. </p><p> CAIN:  To you also, Steve.  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  Do you think the confusion about pass-throughs is going to hurt --  how long is it going to take for our small business people to sort all of  that out?  They made it unnecessarily very complex.  </p><p> CAIN:  I believe it's going to take them a little while to sort it out but  by the time this tax legislation goes into effect, they will have figured  it out.  And see, this is the 20 percent deduction off of profits if you  make money is really easy for small businesses and pass-throughs to  understand.  And this is what Senator Ron Johnson's fought so hard for  which when small business people figure out that this is a net plus.  I  think that they will be excited about it.  I think that is a good move to  help continue job growth and job creation.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Herman, just to switch gears quickly really.  Artificial  Intelligence hitting fast-food chains?  You ran a restaurant chain many  years ago, it's one of the great things you've done.  Caliburger is the  country's first kiosk that uses facial recognition to let customers reorder  items.  I want to know what you think of this.  </p><p> CAIN:  Well, in the interest of this digital revolution, I am not surprised  that those sort of innovations are being developed.  But let me tell you  something, Dagen, that I know from my experience in the quick service  business, you can't automate a smile.  And I'm not talking about the smile  of the customer, you can't automate the smile of the person serving you.   That kiosk will not have an automated Artificial Intelligence smile.   That's what they are going to be giving up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that gets an amen and a hallelujah for me.  And a thank you.   Herman Cain, thank you so much.</p><p> CAIN:  Merry Christmas and happy New Year to everybody.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Merry Christmas, sir.</p><p> CAIN:  And today, Dagen, is going to be a day of celebration. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  And you know what, people will be celebrating in the  weeks or months to come when they realizes the Democrats have been lying to  them and they're getting to keep more of the money that they earned.  Thank  you, Herman.  Still ahead.</p><p> CAIN:  Thank you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Still ahead.  Breaking down what tax reform means for you.  We  will talk to the small business administrator Linda McMahon about the  bill's potential impact on smaller businesses.  And Stitch Fix unravels  after its first post IPO earnings report.  What is causing investor  concerns this morning?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It is  Wednesday, December 20th.  Your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  History  on Capitol Hill.  The Senate bring the midnight oil to pass the largest tax  code overhaul in three decades.  The vote split right down party lines with  not one single Democrat defecting in support of this bill.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. JOSEPH CROWLEY (D), NEW YORK:  You know how this bill is going to  help?  Corporate special interests.  The wealthiest Americans and yes, the  Trump family.  My colleagues, if it looks like a scam, quirks like a scam,  it is a scam.  Can you vote for this bill with a clear conscience?  Hell  no, you can't.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, the Democrats didn't but the Republicans got in line and  the House will vote on the updated bill today, likely sending it to the  President's desk.  We'll talk to small business administrator Linda McMahon  about how this tax reform will impact the business that we truly care  about, mom-and-pop shops, those small businesses.  Optimism still fueling  these markets.  Look at, the Dow is really starting to take off as the  morning moves on.  104-point gain on the Dow futures.  Again, investors see  this reform, this tax overhaul as fueling growth making this a better place  to do business for everybody.  In Europe, we have losses in France and  Germany and in Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower there.  What can Brown  do for Tesla?  UPS preorders, dozens of the company's upcoming semi-trucks  and another show of confidence for electric automobiles, electric vehicles.   And not the right fit for some investors.  Why Stitch Fix shares are  tumbling after the company's first post IPO earnings port.  </p><p> Plus, spend the holidays with a new best friend, that's my best friend  right there, that's Charlie dog.  I'm taking to him about treats in that  video.  But we will have -- Charlie from animal care center here in New  York City and we're going to see some dogs from ACC coming up in just a  little while.  Our top story this morning, Republicans close to sealing the  deal on tax reform.  One vote away from sending sweeping overhaul to the  President's desk.  Blake Burman at the White House with the very latest.   Hey, Blake.  </p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Dagen.  Good morning to you.   The ping-ponging of this $1.5 trillion tax bill is set to reach match point  at some point later today.  In the early morning hours at about 12:45 in  the morning earlier today, the Senate strictly partisan lines.  51  Republicans to 48 Democrats passed the tax bill. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCCONNELL:  After eight straight years of slow growth and underperformance  America is ready to take off.  The very, very wealthy.  The highest  spectrum gets almost all the benefits.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Now on Tuesday, the House had actually passed the tax bill first  when it got over to the Senate.  Some provisions of it were stripped --  were stripped out due to Senate rules.  So that is why it has to go back to  the House again.  Earlier this morning, the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan  described it as bizarre Senate rules in his words and he says, essentially,  what will happen later this morning is a mere formality.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RYAN:  We didn't think they should have dropped off but they did, it  doesn't really, materially affect the bill very much.  And so we will  revote and pass it out again today.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  And Dagen when that happens later this morning after that it will  all be done.  And then it will be ready, the tax bill for the President to  sign however he will not do this immediately.  The basis for how all of  this work is because this bill is so large, it will likely take several  days for it to be enrolled, get to President over his Christmas break.  So  the options that he would have would be to sign it over Christmas break or  potentially sign it in January when he gets back here to the White House as  one senior White House official put it to me, Dagen, that would allow them  to start the year off with a bang.  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And over Christmas like Christmas Eve, Christmas day, the  President wouldn't get that much media coverage I wouldn't think of the  signing and he is a media master, so I don't know if he would sign it on  Christmas.  </p><p> BURMAN:  We love it when the -- when the televisions are on but we also  know on Christmas Eve or Christmas day a lot of them are off.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But, you know -</p><p> BURMAN:  And they know that here -- they know that here too.  So we'll see  how these all shakes out.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Blake, Twitter never sleeps.  We know that.</p><p> BURMAN:  If I learned anything, Dagen, these last 11 months, it is that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Amen.  Thank you. Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  You got it. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Blake Burman at the White House.  There is a lot in this bill  for small businesses.  One of the biggest changes is the way that pass- through -- pass-through entities are taxed.  Pass-through entities now get  a 20 percent deduction that will -- and off of a 30 percent top tax rate,  that will take the top rate on pass-through entities down to 29.6 percent.   And then there are rules that now if you -- these deduction phases out for  married couples at $315,000 for a married couple.  Joining me now to  explain this and the benefits of it is administrator of the small business  administration, Linda McMahon.  Linda, that's what Steve Forbes said this  and I've have been talking about this.  One of the issues, if we have to  find fault with this is that there is some complexity in this soon-to-be  law that applies to these pass-through entities.  How do you get around  that?  </p><p> LINDA MCMAHON, ADMINISTRATOR, SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION: Well, good  morning, Dagen.  Thank so much and, you know, there is no complexity to it  but honestly when our small businesses get through this work through this  and I don't think it's going to be that burdensome for them because they've  been -- they're been accustomed to a little complexity in the past and when  they look at the fact that they're going to get a 20 percent deduction from  their income and they're already now in different tax brackets, they're  going to have about double for their standard deduction.  </p><p> These are real benefits for small businesses and I've traveled the country  over the last several months.  I've been to about 26 states.  I've met with  over 500 small business and talked to them and toured their facilities and  they really were looking so forward to this reduction because they have  told me without fail, they will reinvest any of these savings back into  their businesses.  So they're excited about it and I think if we look at  the enthusiasm that's already in the marketplace, even before the tax bill  was passed and in anticipation of it, we're going to see small businesses  continue to grow.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But to add to what I was talking about.  So for people married  couples who make $315,000 or more, this deduction is limited and it's  phased out entirely for people in some types of businesses, service as  businesses including medical, legal, consulting and then there were some  criticism of -- in addition regarding real estate investors.  Senator Bob  Corker criticized on that, wait if a test that allows businesses to qualify  for this pass -- for the pass-through based on theirs.  But I want to know,  is this something that you could ultimately fix and broaden this tax break  down the road.  Is that something that is even up for discussion at this  point?  </p><p> MCMAHON:  I have not heard discussion at this point, we've been focused so  much working, you know, with Congress and being out in the marketplace and  really hearing from our small businesses about what they would like to see,  and I think that's really where the focus has been but of course, you know,  we'll continue to be advocates for our almost 30 million small businesses  around the country because they really are -- they are the backbone of our  economy, and the engine of our economy.  So we want to keep them strong and  they are very excited about getting tax deductions.  So, I'm in their  corner all the way.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Being the daughter of two individuals who own and ran a small  business my entire life, they feel like they always felt like that  politicians always promised one thing and then delivered another.  But in  fact it seems to be the reverse now at least on some polls, Administrator,  where you guys have stepped up and actually delivered something on cutting  pass-through rates but many Americans don't favor this tax plan.  That you  -- in the Wall Street Journal poll, only 17 percent of people who were  polled think that they're going to get a tax cut when in fact it's 80  percent or more broadly speaking.  Because you've been out there messaging  and talking to these business owners.  Why isn't it connecting more broadly  with American taxpayers and Americans in general?  </p><p> MCMAHON:  Well, I think the proof is going to be in the pudding, Dagen.   We're going to see these benefits, our taxpayers and our small businesses  are going to see more money in their pockets, less money coming out of  their paychecks.  And once this is happening, once the benefits are there,  once our economy is continuing to grow, I think the proof is going to be in  the pudding and I didn't hear any of the small businesses that I talked to  pushing back, saying, boy we're not in favor of tax cuts, we are not in  favor of, you know, paying less to the government.  We like to keep that  money and invest in our business.  I didn't hear that at all.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Administrator, however, the individual cuts expire in 2025, so  do changes for pass-through entities.  That has to be something that  members of your party, the Republicans are talking about trying to extend  at this point because that's going to be -- a lot of the criticism has been  unfair or outright lies from Democrats but that will be something that they  try to hit home and they have been, they keep saying that, oh, half of  Americans are going to have their taxes going up.  Well, that's because  these cuts expire.  So can you fix that in the next few years?  </p><p> MCMAHON:  Well, I think we have seen individual tax cuts extended before,  you know, when they expired and all of this is working and working well, I  don't think anyone is going to vote to let them expire.  And let's look at  it, yes, they do have an expiration date but we're talking almost 10 years.   Let's take the benefit of that today and let's work through -- let's  continue to grow our economy, let's get more towards that four percent that  the President is talking about because I think that really what on the  minds of our small businesses today.  </p><p> They're ready to go, they're ready to start more businesses, they're ready  to invest that income, and they are not really talking about, well, Jeez, I  don't know -- 10 years from now I don't know how that's going to effect.   They want today, they're ready for it.  And they've been promised, the  anticipation level is high and so now it's here and now we're going to see  them -- I think we're going to see them really employ more people and raise  wages and start more business.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How fast do you think the economy can grow with this?  You want  to throw out a number?  </p><p> MCMAHON:  I'll leave that up to the President to project that in Congress.   But I think it's going -- I think we're going to see it and the -- I think  we've got the wind in our back and momentum is clearly there. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Confidence among independent businesses, national federation of  independent business at an all-time high, a record high in November.   Administrator, thank you.  Linda Mcmahon.</p><p> MCMAHON:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Administrator of a small business administration.  Still ahead,  Varney down the big winners of the tax deal and then for the long haul, UPS  betting big on Tesla and the electric automaker's upcoming semi-truck.   Details on the deal, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Tesla getting its largest public preorder for its electric big  rig.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, Dagen.  Well, Tesla unveiled  their big rig the Semis last month, they're going to go into production  2019 and they continue to get orders, the latest one, and its biggest one  ever, now comes from UPS, reserving 125 Tesla Semis.  Both the stocks are  higher today.  And it would be about 200,000 each to a total of about 25  million.  And this comes on the heels of orders from Wal-Mart, also Sysco  Foods, and J.B. Hunt Transportation.  </p><p> How about FedEx?  FedEx is likely to hit a new high at the opening bell  today.  They came out with profits that beat strong global demand.  They  did face a cost from that cyber-attack on their acquisition of TNT Express,  and -- but we know that FedEx and UPS have been all ramping it up for e- commerce.  </p><p> Last but not the least, a quick look at Stitch Fix, this is a fashion  start-up, went public, they were pinched by some costs, and that stock,  Dagen, is down 11-1/2 percent this morning.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Republicans on the verge of a sweeping tax reform victory, the  House set to vote on the final version of the plan this morning, the center  of -- Senate approving the bill late last night.  Joining me now is the  host of \"Varney &amp; Company,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  May I list the winners for you, if I may,  according to moi?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, Stu.</p><p> VARNEY:  Here we go.  First of all, business, huge winner.  When you drop  the top rate of tax from 35 to 21 percent, you're increasing the  profitability of major American corporations in a very big way.  Second,  the economy, because I think those corporations will use a lot of that  extra money that's coming at them to reinvest, plant an equipment that can  -- not depreciate -- that can expense 100 percent immediately.  I think  this is very good for the economy, it boosts growth with all that extra  money flowing in.  Third, I think it's really good news for low tax states  because A, they're going to get an influx of high-income earners from high- tax states, and B, the removal of the deduction for state and local taxes  means nothing in Texas and Florida because they don't have local taxes to  deduct.  </p><p> I think that's a winner.  I, myself, am a loser in all of this as are many  of my colleagues in New York and New Jersey because we will end up paying  more overall in tax than we do now.  Nonetheless, I support it 100 percent  because I think it brings America back to prosperity.  And we need that  more than anything else.  Prosperity is the glue that binds us together.   We all win from growth.  And that's Elizabeth McDonald making a very early  appearance on the show.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I love it, Stuart, and I agree with you, New York, these  blue states are going to be -- if we're going to have a hard time with it,  but I want -- I want businesses and I want the people like my mom and dad  who worked so hard so many years and never got help from the government, I  want them -- I want them to feel the benefits of this, so I'm  wholeheartedly in agreement with you.</p><p> VARNEY:  Everybody -- you may say that some individuals don't get an  immediate benefit, and that would be true, but, overall, our society gets a  huge benefit from growth and prosperity.  We all win from that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I agree.</p><p> VARNEY:  Just my opinion.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts almost exactly 10  minutes from now.  Stuart, I was looking away because we have some special  guests in the studio.  Not Elizabeth McDonald, but -- Stuart Varney at 9:00  a.m., Monday through Friday.  Stuart is unbelievable, incredible man.  </p><p> Still ahead, why was I looking away?  Because Santa Claus is coming to  town.  Santa Claus is in the studio right now.  That's my Charlie dog who  came from New York's ACC.  And we have two dogs who need adopting.  They're  in the studio.  Merry Christmas, guys.  Yes.  Hi, Buddy.  Hi, Maris.  Hi,  Maris.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  One of the best things you can do is give a pet a home, go out  and rescue a dog particularly this close to the holiday season.  Our next  guests are looking to do that.  The organization is central to New York in  rescuing animals.  Joining me now is Katie Hanson, she's Marketing and  Communications Director with Animal Care Centers of New York City.  She  brought some friends here.  Katie, this is Kelly, and this is Maris.  Maris  is how old?  Seven?</p><p> KATIE HANSON, MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, ANIMAL CARE CENTER:   Seven.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Kelly is two.</p><p> HANSON:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And you guys are super special.  And Maris was barking at my  Charlie dog on the T.V.  But people need to understand and we were talking  about this, essentially, ACC is where all of the animals go that are  abandoned.  If a police officer in New York City finds a dog or finds an  animal in need, this is where these animals go.</p><p> HANSON:  Exactly, we're the only -- it's called an open admissions shelter  and we are the only one in New York City that takes in all of the animals,  so we take in about 30 -- between 30,000 and 35,000 animals a year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And you've rescue -- your rescue rate or your adoption rate is  sky high.  You've adopted out how many animals so far this year?</p><p> HANSON:  So, so far this year, we've placed 94 percent of the animals that  have come in of the dogs and cats that have come in.  And that is through  direct adoptions, and also, we work with like about 200 rescue partners.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There are a lot of other -- my Charlie dog, by the way, you were  seeing a video of him, came from ACC.  He was an owner surrender.  That  literally his owners had him for six years, never took care of him, and he  was sick, and they dumped him with you guys.  And you just see that so  often.  And Charlie was sick which is not that old, but I want to encourage  people also not only do not go out and buy a dog, go rescue, it makes me  crazy.  I had a conversation the other day with somebody about this, that  they were going to go to a pet store and buy a dog, and I said, there's so  many animals in need, particularly, Maris -- hi, buddy.  Maris, how you  doing?</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's seven so he's almost -- he's a little bit older,  particularly senior dog and he's barking at the --</p><p> HANSON:  Oh, sees himself.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Maris.  Maris can't be fixed.  So, that's why he's --  because of his age.  So, that's why he's loving on Kelly a little bit.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But really quickly, you also go out and rescue seniors, too?</p><p> HANSON:  Yes, exactly, because they -- and they're actually so much easier  --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Come here.</p><p> HANSON:  -- because they're already house-trained that just kind of want to  hang out and give you love and kisses, so --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, he just gave me a kiss on the leg.  Yes, he did.  And also  you're not -- your -- you started that campaign where you're not  identifying the breeds because these would be referred to as a pit bull  but, again, bad rap.</p><p> HANSON:  Bad rap.  So, they're basically just large free dogs.  And as you  can see, they're totally individual.  Couch potato, a little rambunctious,  so it's really just based on the individuals.  So, they're both large breed  dogs, but they have unique personality.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And check out -- and really --</p><p> HANSON:  They're boroughbred, yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Come and visit.  Come and visit.</p><p> HANSON:  Yes, come to the shelter.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, Charlie dog is my -- is my life, he is my best friend and  our other dog Ramon, and he came right from ACC.  Ramon and Charlie.</p><p> HANSON:  Thank you so much for having us on.  This is great exposure for  them.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.  Thank you, Katie.</p><p> HANSON:  Thank you so much.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thanks to Lea, Kevin, and Steve.  And happy anniversary to Lea's  parents, love you all.  That does it for us, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" is right  now.  Stuart?</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I  can't believe it.  Thank you, ladies.  Good to see you, guys.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday,  December 20th.  Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Senate making history.  Republicans approving the largest overhaul of  our country's tax system in about 30 years, early this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY:  I'm a little surprised the democrats  all decided voting against middle class tax relief and make American  business more competitive as a smart vote and that's an argument we're more  than happy to have.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  Eighty-three percent of the middle class  will get -- will either pay more in taxes or get little breadcrumbs.  Is  that this great bill that's helping the middle class?  Absolutely not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The house will vote on the bill later today, likely sending it  to the President Trump's desk to sign.</p><p>The house originally did pass it yesterday, but there was a procedural snag  that is forced the second vote.  It was a snag over in the senate.   Following the passage in the senate, futures are showing this happening in  the markets.  We had a slight full back in the Dow yesterday, off about 37  points.  But we're seeing possibly new all-time highs for all your major  market gauges.</p><p>By the way, you have highs on the transports earlier in the week on the  Russell 2000.  Literally every single market gauge in the U.S. has been  moving in sync on the optimism from this tax reform package.</p><p>Over in Europe, checking on England, France and Germany, we have losses  across the board.  All those slight, all markets there down, lessen, about  two tenths of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight stocks mostly lower as well.  The Nikkei in Japan up ever  so slightly.</p><p>ISIS threatening America.  The terror group warning of the New Year's Eve  attack. The latest as New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo announces heightened  security measures for the holidays.</p><p>Uber, dealt a blow in Europe.  The EU's top core has ruled that the  ridesharing company is a taxi service and should be regulated as such.  We  break down the major implications of that ruling.</p><p>What can brown do for Tesla?  The details as UPS delivers a big bet on the  company's electric semi-truck.</p><p>And Diddy making moves to be the top cat down in Carolina.  The music mogul  reportedly meeting with ambassadors in his bid to buy the Panthers.  How  the teams could soon have a new owner.  All of that and so much more coming  up this morning.</p><p>Fox News correspondent, Lea Gabrielle, Benchmark managing partner, Kevin  Kelly and Forbes Media chairman, former republican presidential candidate,  Steve Forbes.</p><p>When you walked in this morning, I went I am so glad you're here.  Any day,  but particularly this day, Mr. Forbes.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because we have the same feeling about this tax cut package.   But if you listen to the democrats, we're going to hell.  That's pretty  much the message.  The country is going hell.  It's savory and I just say,  poppycock to that.  So we're going to get into that immediately.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it's a good word to use on a family channel.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I have an entire lexicon of things like that, like gooey  and poppycock, and balderdash.  So I will break all of that out.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  I think I heard you called the democrats  when it's coming into this plain nincompoops.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  You know what?  I actually called the  republicans nincompoops.</p><p>KELLY:  That's what it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As thy are putting this together, this is -- </p><p>FORBES:  Another old word is knuckleheads.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Knuckleheads.  This is what we're going to talk about though,  that why do people not yet feel good about this tax reform?  Part of it is  the problem of how they put it together.  So we're going to talk about that  in two seconds.  I just want to tease our guests that are coming up,  Illinois congressman, Peter Roskam.  Fox News senior judicial analyst,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Louisiana senator, John Kennedy.  Former  republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  And administrator of the  small business administration, Linda McMahaon.  There's a lot in this  package for small businesses as well.</p><p>But first, on the verge of a big tax victory.  Republicans are set to give  their final approval to a sweeping tax overhaul today after the senate  passed a plan and a late night vote.</p><p>House are scheduled a final vote this morning on the plan ready to send it  to President Trump's desk to sign it into law.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell says that both American businesses  and individual tax payers will see the benefit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCONNELL:  We had three, two quarters in a row of three percent growth.   Stock market is up.  Optimism is high.  Coupled with this tax reform,  America is ready to start performing as they should have for a number of  years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The president congratulating lawmakers on Twitter, writing \"The  United States senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut in reform  barrel.  Terrible individual mandate, Obamacare repealed.  Goes to the  house tomorrow morning for a final vote.  If approved, there will be a news  conference at the White House at approximately 1:00 p.m.</p><p>Steve Forbes, we're on the precipice of passing this first major tax  overhaul.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" is saying certainly on the business  side, it actually does more in some ways than the '86 tax reform did in  terms of reforming corporate taxes.</p><p>FORBES:  The big news on the business side reducing the rate, corporate  rate down to 21 and pastors and its partnerships, Ascopr in the like which  how most American businesses organize for tax purposes.  They got that rate  down.  Looks like 29.6.  We'll have to see the final details on that.</p><p>Overseas earnings, no longer being penalized and bringing some of that cash  back home.  Instant expensing.  So if there are no sleepers in this bill,  and the market, I think would have fare the amount by now.  They did good  on that side.  The individual side is where they've got to do work the next  time.</p><p>And I hope today -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  When is the next time?  When is that?</p><p>FORBES:  Well, this is what they should announce today.  That oh, yes, it's  great history, since 1986 and all that good stuff.  What they should also  announce is this is a down payment.  This is the first of many big tax cuts  to come.  Give people anticipation, especially on the individual side.   We're going to keep slashing taxes because you the Americans create the  resources and can employ them better than Washington bureaucrats.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think the question though for many of us, is that really  possible if you look at the debt worth, 20 trillion in debt and people can  show that a national security issue.  So, can you -- is it really feasible  -- </p><p>FORBES:  What history shows -- experience shows is the only way you get a  balanced budget, if you want that is what the booming economy.  Late 1960s.   Kennedy tax cuts, finally in the 90s, after the Cold War and Reagan's Cold  War victory massive tax cuts.  So if you want to get the Russian's fiscal  situation under control, that economy where people feel good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  On that note, Steve, the budget deficit has grown in the last  two years.  Spending has gone up, but not that much, it's because revenues  haven't been growing in the most recent fiscal year revenue grew at one  percent and in an expansion, it should be growing at three to five percent,  but this recovery, this growth period in American history has been so weak  because of regulations and because of flawed tax code quite frankly.</p><p>FORBES:  The last decade was at the worst economic growth since the 1930s.   And so that's why I think even deregulation sounds boring, but regulations  are attacks and the fact they are moving regulations, Washington isn't  getting up each morning figuring out how to make life more miserable for  business, has already had an impact.</p><p>And you're going to see now that this thing is going to be actually in  reality.  You're going to see much more investment.  And what democrats  refuse to recognize is, if you want a higher standard of living, you have  to have people making investments, creating those new products and  services, there's better paying jobs.</p><p>And one of the things they should emphasize is not just going to keep more  what you now earn, but your earnings, your pay is going to up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  Thank you.  To all of these democrats, not one  democrat voter for this plan.  And I tweeted this out earlier.  \"More than  80 percent of people, of taxpayers in this country, at least in the first  year are going to get a tax cut.  They're going to see more money in their  paycheck.</p><p>They're going to get to keep more of the money that they earned.  So try  running on that, because the democrats think that the messaging is that  again, the country that we -- this is a scam, whatever language that you  want to pit.</p><p>But again, try running on giving people more of their money.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, the problem is that democrats don't have any right to critic  this plan because none of them voted for it.  We're limited to $155  trillion.  We've seen under the previous administration that they didn't  even want to tackle deficits.  So we're in this vicious circle where all of  a sudden now the democrats have found religion when it comes to deficits.</p><p>But at the detriment of the American people that actually need strong  growth, they've been under the thumb of rules and regulations including the  Obamacare, as President Trump has alluded to.</p><p>But I think the important thing to take away from this is that it's cheaper  is for companies to invest here in the United States than it is abroad,  right?</p><p>But there was a detriment for them to invest here, when you can have four  corporations coming in and compete at a lower tax rate.  Look over at the  U.K., right?  Twenty percent corporate tax rate that are going to take to  17.5 percent.</p><p>We are nowhere near competitive.  We have one of the highest corporate tax  rates in the world.  So, how do you get companies to invest here?  You  unleash prosperity through property plan, equipment when they can reinvest  in a 21 percent rate.</p><p>FORBES:  One of the things that republicans should learn from this is get  rid of this constraint, from this congressional budget office, these fakes,  projections out 10 years that assume the tax cuts don't do much for the  economy, get rid of that.  Assume 3.5 percent growth and by golly have  greater muscular tax cuts.  One must be a tax cut in the future.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I need to get this.  This is what I want to you -- I want to get  your answer on this and it goes to the way that the democrats have been  messaging this.  While markets are optimistic about this tax plan, business  owners and operators are optimistic.  It remains unpopular with the  American people.  Actually, it's become more unpopular.</p><p>This is a new \"Wall Street Journal-NBC News\" poll that found 41 percent of  Americans say that the tax plan is a bad idea.  Just 24 percent of it say  it's a good idea.  Top republicans insist the numbers will shift in the  coming months.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCONNELL:  My view of this, if we can't sell this to the American people,  we ought to go into another line of work.  I think this is an important  accomplishment for the country, that people will value and appreciate, but  obviously it requires us to continue this discussion.</p><p>REP.  PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  People are out there  on TV telling mistruth, disguising the facts of this thing.  That's going  to make it unpopular.  When we get this done, when people see the  withholding improving, when they see the jobs occurring, when they see  bigger paychecks, a fairer tax system, a simpler tax code, that's what's  going to produce the results.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Richard Rubin is the reporter at \"The Wall Street Journal\" and  he points out and I did as well on Twitter, 80 percent in the first year,  80 percent of households get a tax cut.  At least, if not more than that.   But 17 percent of people think they're getting tax cuts.  That is  unbelievable.</p><p>Bit to the democrats who are saying it's a scam.  Tom Perez, the head of  the DNC said in his statement taxes are going up.  Yet, taxes are going up  for people when these tax cuts expire, eight or ten years from now.  That's  a lie.</p><p>The American people are being told lies by the democrats.  But I say to  them, I say to these liberals who are messaging this, you know what?   People are going to get more money back.  They're going to see money in  their paychecks.  So good luck with that.</p><p>FORBES:  You see, one of the problems with the mainstream media is located  they're located in New York and California.  Many of them won't see a tax  cut because the loss of state and local deductions.</p><p>So in their little world this thing doesn't look so good.  They forget the  rest of the country.  And one of the things republicans have got to do is  more messaging.  Not just say the results and speak for themselves, but  explain to people why this is better and also start talking about payroll  reform.</p><p>Six years ago, they allowed for a couple of years people to keep their  first two points on the social security tax, even if you didn't pay income  tax, which many Americans don't.  You got a higher paycheck, so they should  put that on the table, say, if we get reelected, everyone in the work is  going to get another tax cut.  Start throwing out things for the future.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're not going to argue about that because the payroll tax --  well, the payroll tax goes to fund the benefit.  It goes to fund social  security and Medicare.</p><p>FORBES:  But the fact of the matter is they use the general budget when  they need it.  And they've used this for political purposes to make sure  everyone feels it for a couple of years and you do more muscular tax cuts.   So it's part of a plan -- set of this kiddy credit, which is a giveaway for  people </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have to go.  But I want to point something out.  When in this  country did we start believing that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and  democrats make better decisions with our money?  This is my money.  I think  I make better decisions about my life, my health and my money than those  elected officials who have their heels dug in down in D.C.</p><p>FORBES:  Even a buffets of democrats, I'll trust him more than Nancy  Pelosi.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a big blow for Uber in Europe.  A new ruling says that the  company should be regulated like taxis.  What it means for drivers and  users of the popular ridesharing app?</p><p>Plus, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, reportedly taking another step in its effort to  buy the Carolina Panthers.  New details on how Colin Kaepernick might be  involved.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This breaking news overnight.  The E.U. dealing a major setback  to Uber.  Lauren Simonetti has the details.  Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Dagen, the European court of  justice ruling that Uber should be regulated as a taxi company and not as a  digital service.  Uber has been trying to use courts to reduce their  regulatory oversight.  Uber claims that I's an app, so it could connect  drivers with passengers that they pick up.</p><p>Uber adds that the ruling should not have an immediate impact on how it  operates in Europe.  Shares -- well, it's not a publicly traded company.   Or at least not yet.</p><p>UPS ordering 125 of Tesla's all-electric semi-trucks.  This is the largest  public order for the big, thus far.  The Tesla trucks will cost about  $200,000 each.  Tesla expects them to be in production by 2019.</p><p>This is where I'm going to show you shares of Tesla.  They're up 1.1  percent at 334.92 in premarket trading.</p><p>Well, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs or Diddy, that's what his name is these days,  serious about buying the Carolina Panthers.  Yahoo Sports is reporting that  Diddy is huddling with potential investors hoping to put together an  ownership group.</p><p>Those efforts are expected to include Colin Kaepernick.  He and Diddy,  according to the report had a conversation and they discussed the former  NFL quarterback's role in any potential deal.  Panthers' owner Jerry  Richardson announced that he would be putting the franchise up for sale  amid sexual and racial misconduct allegations.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you think?</p><p>KELLY:  I mean, I think it's pretty interesting.  Well, getting back to the  Uber situation that most of the rules and regulations that come on this  technology companies, whether it's Google or Uber or any other is coming  from Europe.  And I think that's going to be a big thing going into next  year.</p><p>I think there's going to be a lot of rules and regulations coming,  especially to Facebook.  So, I think that's pretty telling.  We're starting  to see the ripples now.  We'll feel the effects next year.</p><p>FORBES:  And also shows why Britain pulled out of the E.U. is that they're  very anti-growth, anti-innovation.  Always has this guild medieval  mentality of something new comes along, we have much pressure and control  it</p><p>And you're right though.  In this country, the big tech companies don't  realize they're going into a political buzz saw because of their alleged  power and they haven't done -- in the old days, back before any of you were  born, the old AT&amp;T monopoly survived as long as it did, because it made  sure everyone was serviced, everyone -- every politician got free phone,  not free phone service during the campaign.  But they got the phone  service, every newspaper and the net.  They covered all their bases.</p><p>These tech companies, especially Google discriminating against  conservatives on what they're allowed to post.  That stuff is going to get  a political backlash.  I wish they'd wake up to this.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that they are waking up. I think that they are waking  up, that they realized the power of Washington and what they -- what might  be brought to bear on them.</p><p>FORBES:  They're still playing with the conservatives.</p><p>KELLY:  They're the biggest donors to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, and  so they're actually enabling this.  And so they're kind of blinded by kind  of their friends in Washington that aren't really going to be there to help  them out.</p><p>FORBES:  They have to realize there are two parties in this country.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll see the reaction of this tax reform because it's going to  feel good to a lot of them.</p><p>Coming up, ISIS, threatening attacks here and in Europe over the holiday  season.  The latest target, New Year's Eve.  How officials here in New York  City are stepping up security a week after that subway bomb blast.</p><p>And the divide in the fight against opioid abuse.  The overdose antidote  helping victims, but it may also put law enforcement at risk.  The  controversy, ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A new terror warning.  ISIS releasing several disturbing  propaganda posters threatening attacks over the holiday season.  The latest  target?  New Year's Eve.  This comes a week and a half after an attempted  suicide bombing in New York City.</p><p>New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo has announced tightened security measures  over the holidays including increased personnel, bomb sniffing dogs and  even radiation detectors.</p><p>Joining us this morning is national security analyst at the Clarion  Project, professor of counterterrorism at Liberty University down at  Lynchburg, Virginia, Ryan Mauro.</p><p>Ryan, what do you make of this?</p><p>RYAN MAURO, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, CLARION PROJECT:  Well, of course  ISIS is going to be saying something like this.  For me, what the message  should be is even if they were to succeed in carrying out an attack, the  so-called lonewolf for those doesn't actually exist.  One guy goes off and  he kill some people.</p><p>Overall, they're still a bunch of losers.  Ninety-six percent of their  caliphate has been destroyed.  We need to start weaponizing Trump's  trolling.  Make fun of them for how many dumb things that they do and for a  group that claims that Allah is blessing them and on their side, well,  actually it kind of looks like if they all exist, he's on our side because  we're really killing them.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, Ryan, I think you make such a good point because ISIS  has lost ground in the Middle East, essentially what it's trying to  establish is a cyber-caliphate and so it's trying to influence people.   People who are crazy.</p><p>A lot of these people who are lonewolf attackers don't really have a real  attachment to terrorist groups overseas, as you know.  And instead what  they're trying to do is reach people who are angry, people who want to take  that anger and hate out on people and then essentially get to them through  the internet.</p><p>But when you look at terror attacks in places like New York City, these  lonewolf attacks, what's so difficult is trying to identify them ahead of  time.  So you have some 3,000 police officers patrolling down the subway  systems for example in New York each day.</p><p>What they're really having to be able to do is assess people.  So how can  people better be able to asses people or officers and just people on the  streets to see if maybe they're -- to have those assessments in mind in  case they see some something and then they should say something.</p><p>MAURO:  Sure.  Great question.  The average civilian is just looking at  something like a backpack that's place somewhere.  That's kind of obvious  thing that made you uncomfortable reporting that type of thing.  For law  enforcement, I do a lot of training of law enforcement and what I'll teach  them is look for these dramatic overhauls in someone's personality because  that's what the radicalization process looks like.  Obsession.  He becomes  obsessed with the ideology.</p><p>They usually start alienating their friends and family because they become  real judgmental.  But I would say that when you look into the backgrounds  of these folks, yes, they may not initially have connections to a terrorist  group, per say, but they will have connections to a supposedly nonviolent  extremist movement.</p><p>You look far back into where these initial ideas kind of incubate and  you'll see connections to groups around the world that are considered  moderate by comparison, but still radical in repulsive and that's where I  think our attention should and that's why I think that congress really need  to investigate how the Obama administration impeded counterterrorism  investigations and prosecutions because that's the foundation where this  begins.</p><p>It's not about political points.  It's about figuring out where these  mistakes were made and going back and fixing them.</p><p>FORBED:  One of the things that happen a few years ago is the New York  police department had a good intelligence operation and then politically  they forward it.  Is that back up to full speed again?</p><p>MAURO:  Not really.  Because what happens is when something like that  occurs, you influence the culture.  And so you can still have  investigations on the street level, but those specific programs that were  shut down, even if you were to revive them -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Muslim communities and mosques just trying to figure out if  there is a would-be terrorist where the individual was working, where the  individual might be living and basically in secret.  But do you think --  New Yorkers are angry.</p><p>New Yorkers are angry that in 14 months, we've had three terror attacks.   Eight people killed over near the Westside highway on a bike path and then  after the fact, they put up concrete barricades, some of which are  decorated for Christmas.  People are irritated, they're angry, they're --  you know what and what is New York going to do about it?</p><p>MAURO:  Well, there a few different programs that were conflated.  The  biggest amount of lying that went on in the media and also pushed by  certain activist organizations was this idea that the NYPD was just spying  on Muslims for simply Muslim.</p><p>If you look at the stuff that real resources were put into, there are  always indications of extremism such as classes on how to disarm police.   If you get into a fight with cops.  That's a sign of extremism.  Start  there.</p><p>Believe it or not, those type of indicators are all over the place and  that's where you start.  And if you look at this as an ideological  insurgency, not a criminal intelligence problem, not even terrorism  problem, but an ideological insurgency and you say what is the  infrastructure for this problem.  Start there.  You'll find the bad guys.   It just requires some political incorrectness.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ryan, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  Ryan Mauro.  Again,  be vigilant.  Be vigilant.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook expanding the use of its facial recognition, but it's  raising new concerns over privacy.</p><p>And do you have one of the most popular computer passwords of the year?   We'll tell you why that's not a good thing.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, December 20th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Clearing  the final hurdles to tax reform, the Senate burning the midnight oil to  pass the largest tax code overhaul in three decades, the votes split  straight down party line, not one single Democrat defecting in support of  this bill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE:  I think every  Democrat who votes against this and apparently, that's all of them in the  House and Senate, are saying, in effect, we are satisfied of where we are.   They're simply not interested in doing the kind of things that economists  believe will get the country growing again.</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER (D), MARYLAND:  There was no inclusion of Democrats in  this process.  When the senator says, you know, we want to give tax cut,  frankly, we want to give tax cut as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The House will vote on the updated bill today, likely sending it  to the President's desk.  Optimism over tax reform still fuelling these  markets, futures are showing gains across the board, 75 point gain on the  Dow futures right now.  It has been an incredible year for stocks.  Dow was  down about 37 points yesterday, but we are seeing the optimism return.</p><p>In Europe, we have losses across the board in England, France, and Germany,  and seems like the sung is picking up a little bit of steam in France and  Germany right now.  In Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower as well, the  slight gain for the Nikkei in Japan.  </p><p>Tragedy in Mexico, a tour bus carrying American cruise ship passengers  crashes, killing at least 12 people.  We have the latest from that  investigation ahead.  The opioid epidemic striking the workplace, alcohol  and drug-related overdoses at work, spike to new levels, how the government  is working to combat that growing health crisis.</p><p>And putting the face in Facebook, the social media site sparking privacy  concern with new facial recognition technology, why the company says it  added the feature, ahead.  And these aren't the passwords you're looking  for, Star Wars make its debut on the annual list of the worst passwords, we  will let you know what took the top spot this year.</p><p>But to our top story this half hour, the opioid epidemic hitting the  workplace, according to a new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  unintentional drug and alcohol overdose deaths at work spiked 32 percent in  2016.  The number tripling since the bureau began compiling data back in  2011.  Joining us this morning is Opiant Pharmaceuticals CEO, Doctor Roger  Crystal, Doctor, your company develops the easy-to-use overdose antidote,  NARCAN, which is a nasal spray, so you're at the forefront of combating  this opioid epidemic.  What do you think of these new statistics?</p><p>DR. ROGER CRYSTAL, CEO OF OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS:  For me, given my  background, this really isn't a surprise, actually, unfortunately.  The  opioid crisis has just continued to grow.  I'm from the U.K., originally,  and trained as a surgeon and there are those types of numbers that don't  yet exist, but part of that, kind of, the big driver of that has been,  unfortunately, in the past.  The over-prescribing of opioid painkillers,  and that's something that we need to address as a country alongside  treating all of these people who are unfortunately addicted to opioids and  alcohol.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Aren't we already doing that in terms of really reining in the  amount of opioids prescribed.  I mean, I personally experienced it with all  my doctors, you have -- you have dental surgery, they do not give you  Vicodin any longer.  In terms of it, even at the state level, it's -- you  have -- it is very, very hard to get a prescription for anything as  powerful as, like, Oxycodone or Oxycontin at this point.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  That's true that there are some measures in place already, so I  hope we do -- we will see a reduction.  I will say that even recently as  last year, there were still over 200 million opioid prescriptions made out  to approximately 20 million people.  So this is a huge issue and that  doesn't also address the two and a half million opioid addicts who we have  in this country already.  So we are really not there yet, I'm afraid. . KELLY:  Yes, so getting back to your product and what you guys do, you guys  have a nasal spray that people that are currently addicted to heroin take  or can you explain to us the product and you've got FDA approval and, kind  of, walk us through what you guys are doing.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  So, the product is called the NARCAN Nasal Spray and this saves  lives if someone with overdose from an opioid.  And when we say opioid,  yes, correct, it is something like heroin or Fentanyl, unfortunately, we  see there now, but also, just routine normal painkillers such as Oxycontin  and Vicodin and was -- I agree that they are being prescribed less.  </p><p>They are still overprescribed, and it's not for someone who's even  necessarily an addict.  I'm in good health, I don't abuse opioids, if my  dentist were to prescribe me Oxycontin, I will still be at risk of an  opioid overdose (INAUDIBLE) prudent for me to be prescribed the NARCAN  Nasal Spray alongside any opioid as a -- as a just in case measure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to get to why you're talking about NARCAN.  There  was a report recently that police departments are split over the use of  NARCAN, that some police officials are talking about like a resources for  obtaining, maintaining and tracking supplies, and for training in and when  how to use it, are you seeing any pushback from police departments when  they encounter rescue squads, ambulance services, paramedics, when they  encounter people who have overdosed for them using NARCAN?</p><p>CRYSTAL:  The feedback from ourselves and from our partners adapt farmers  as well.  There's no real pushback in terms of not wanting to recede the  NARCAN Nasal Spray.  It's easy to use, it saves lives, it's been FDA  approved.  So there's a real gratitude when they finally can get hold of it  because actually, it's something that people are then able to use and save  lives, the challenge about resources that is more -- a broader issue about  funding.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's true for some, but I know that Sheriff Jones in Butler  County Ohio, does not want his officers carrying this and it's because for  one thing. They say that, you know, law enforcement officials are supposed  to be able to enforce the law, not end up, basically, treating people who  are going to overdose again and again, and they see these repeat offenders.  </p><p>You know, they also say that sometimes, people come to and they actually  assault the person who was trying to help them.  There was an incident  about in Middle town where an injured firefighter was injured.  And so you  look at this, and you go, a firefighter is supposed to be fighting fires,  yet, they do, you know, give emergency medical help as well.  But gosh,  like, should they be carrying this around and then being put in this  position where they are -- they are expanding their duties to something  that they really are not supposed to be doing?</p><p>CRYSTAL:  Well, that represents this issue, a vast minority of people and  certainly, the (INAUDIBLE) you mentioned is very outspoken and that's  particularly rare.  The emergency responders in general, that is their  chance (INAUDIBLE) overall is to respond to an emergency, why, to  ultimately save lives and this is -- this is a very successful way of  saving a life if given appropriately.  And people if they get the right  training, should absolutely be well-handled to do so. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your company got some good news about feasibility of a heroin  vaccine that's getting worse.  Tell us about that.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  So this is an early stage program that we are very fortunate to  have partnered with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and neither  the National Institute of Drug Abuse, so we have this program and we got  some recent news that's going to be published around the feasibility of  this heroin vaccine.  It's showing that not only does the vaccine seem to  work in an animal model against heroin, but also, activity with some of  these opioid painkillers as well.  </p><p>We are encouraged by that.  We also have the data to show that this can  potentially be scaled up and therefore, truly manufactured on the  commercial level once it gets into the clinics, so this is very important  even at this stage, when we are thinking about this as a proper product to  get out there.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA:  Can we get a  balance in pain management as, you know, 15 years ago, the rap against  medical profession was they weren't doing enough people in pain which led  to for whatever reason we have the crisis today.  What is the balance?</p><p>CRYSTAL:  The balance is a tough one to strike.  And I talked about my  experience in the U.K. as a surgeon there.  And by no means is the U.K.  perfect at all.  We probably didn't prescribe sufficient analgesia.  The  balance, really, to think about how we address that is starting off with  medical schools, and I say, medical, not just the M.D. medical, but dental  schools and anyone else who's interfacing with patients who are in pain.   Pain just doesn't need to be addressed with painkillers.  </p><p>I think that's the first thing that's really important to think about here.   Often physical therapy can be extremely helpful and in fact, patients need  to understand that some pain isn't, in fact, a bad thing, if they are  reassured, psychologically, that this is part of healing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the backlash has been toward, and I speak from personal  experience, family experience, that people who are in critical pain, who  need opioids, who need Oxycontin, who need Oxycodone, who are fighting  stage 4 bone cancer.  It is incredibly difficult now to get prescription  refilled, that you have to have, and the supplies -- they give you a very  short supply.  </p><p>But these are people who literally can't get addicted because of the pain  levels they're experiencing.  These are deadly diseases and they're just  trying to manage their pain, but it's incredibly difficult.  Now, for these  people to even -- to go -- you have to drive -- my mother has to drive two  hours to get a paper prescription from her doctor every couple of weeks,  literally.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  No, absolutely.  And that's very unfortunate and the fact that  people who generally do require opioids, potentially are finding harder to  get access.  I absolutely sympathize tremendously in that situation.  The  issue we have is the vast majority of people probably not to be on opioids  in the first place.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  I mean, that's what's so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, there it lies the personal responsibility, I have  conversations with friends and family all of the time, that if a doctor  ever offers to give you an opioid, you say no, I just had tooth pulled, I  don't need Vicodin for that.  And people are hesitant now, I think, at  least through the communication through the media, people are hesitant to  take opioids at all because they know they're so highly addictive, I mean,  it doesn't take much for some people to become chronically addicted to the  point that they can't stop taking it.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  Absolutely.  And the issue that we have here is that not everyone  is so willing to challenge (INAUDIBLE) and actually, it's a multifaceted  approach.  So, it's the historical marketing of drugs, it's the fact that  doctors have been overprescribing, it's the fact that patients aren't as  empowered as perhaps they have been, so it's very difficult to say there's  one specific area of responsibility but recognizing we have this crisis.  </p><p>We need to do something about it.  Part of it is to stop the  overprescribing and misprescribing of opioids and for where we play a role  as a company, is to treat addictions themselves.  Anyone who is an opioid  addict, the sooner you can get on definitive medical care and the longer  you can receive medical treatment, the far greater the likelihood of not  relapsing and actually going into long-term recovery and that's what we are  committed to.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Doctor Crystal, it's good to see you.  Doctor Roger Crystal,  thank you so much for being here.  Coming up, Delta says, pay up, the  airline calling on officials at Atlanta's Airport for compensation after  the massive power outage caused Delta to lose millions of dollars in  revenue because thousands of flights have to be canceled.  And (INAUDIBLE)  shares of the popular online retailer, Stitch Fix, tumbling after its first  earnings report as a public company, the details are next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, futures reporting to a higher open, 78-point gain  on the Dow Futures right now.  </p><p>We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  Stitch Fix shares unraveling in  pre-market following its first earnings report since its IPO.  The  personalized apparel company reporting strong customer gains, but it only  narrowly beat profit expectations because of expansion costs.  The company  is also struggled to convince investors it can keep up the growth.  Shares  are down 12 percent in premarket trading.  </p><p>And can the Blackberry turn around continue?  The former smartphone giant  is set to report its third-quarter earnings before the bell today.   Analysts are expecting revenue of about $215 million.  The company has  recently pivoted away from phones to cybersecurity software.  Blackberry  shares are up nearly 60 percent so far, this year.  </p><p>12 people are dead after a tour bus crashes in Mexico, Lauren Simonetti has  details, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Such a terrible story, Dagen.  The bus was carrying cruise ship  passengers on an (INAUDIBLE) in Mexico when it flipped over on a narrow  highway yesterday, killing 12 people; 20 others injured, including seven  Americans.  Royal Caribbean says passengers from two of its ships were on  that bus.  Investigators now are working to go figure out what caused the  crash.  </p><p>Well, Delta wants some money back.  The airline is seeking to be repaid for  lost revenue after Sunday's power outage at Hartsfield-Jackson  International Airport in Atlanta.  Delta CEO Bastian says, the airline may  have lost between 25 and $50 million of revenue as a result, and he plans  to talk to both the airport as well as Georgia Power.  That outage caused  Delta to cancel about 1400 flights, and they also had to put stranded  passengers up in hotel rooms.  Hartsfield-Jackson is Delta's main hub.   Taking a look at shares of the company, this year up about 13 percent.  </p><p>And can you believe that in 2017 people are still using password as their  password?  Here is a list of this year's most common password.  We'll start  with number three: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, really, I swear.  And second place  is: password, for the fourth year in a row.  The most common password of  the year: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  I don't even know how this is possible.   Because many Web sites, at least the one I use, make you change your  password, and then you have to have the capital letter, the number, the  symbol that you can't remember it, so you're constantly changing it.   Anyway, for those of you who still use \"password\", we have new passwords  that you might want to change to.  None of these are good, but they are  popular: \"let me in\", \"monkey\", and \"Star Wars\", made to the list of the  most common new password.  Dagen, what are your passwords?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, I can't even remember them.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I only know them on the QWERTY keyboard by the keystrokes.  But  it's never -- you're not supposed to actually use a word ever, no word in  the dictionary, there should never be a word in your password.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Impossible to remember.</p><p>KELLY:  Can I just say that hope that one of the brain trusts of the  Democratic Party John Podesta watch this segment, the password for his e- mail which WikiLeaks got was \"p@ssword\" and the \"a\" was the \"@\" symbol.   So, hopefully, he watches this -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I thought that was pretty classy.</p><p>KELLY:  He knows not -- hopefully he didn't change it to \"Let me In\", or  \"Monkey,\" or \"Star Wars.\" </p><p>FORBES:  I hope the used the password for Democrats, tax cuts.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And needed little @.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you put in #tax, if you're going to tweet, the first thing  that comes up tax cut scam.  And it just makes me so angry because it's not  a -- the Democrats weren't involved in it, that doesn't mean it's a scam.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>FORBES:  No.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  But that's good marketing.  </p><p>KELLY:  No, it's a scam when you get to keep more of your own money.  It's  ridiculous.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But all hat -- all hat no cattle, is what that is.  Good  marketing, yes.  Good words, no action.  Coming up, control or creepy?   Facebook's expanded facial recognition, which will alert you if your  picture is posted through the social media site even if you're not tagged  in it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook raising new privacy concerns.  The company expanding  its facial recognition technology, it will now alert you if your photo is  posted to the social media site even if you're not tagged in it.  But  Facebook has a different spin, Gerry Willis is here with the details.  I  don't think it sounds like the worst idea, actually.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FBN HOST:  It doesn't, and they're not saying that at all,  that we're going to hurt your privacy.  In fact, they're saying 180-degree  the opposite.  Here's what they say, if someone uploads a photo of your  face to Facebook, the company usually knows that it's you, thanks to facial  recognition technology.  Facebook will now alert people that a friend or a  friend of a friend, whoever uploaded a photo of them, even they haven't  been tagged in the picture.  </p><p>This is what Facebook says, \"We're doing this to prevent from people from  impersonating others on Facebook.\"  Facebook says it has no plans to use  facial recognition to enhance ads targeting.  That's the first thing I  thought of, that this has something to do with advertising.  Like, sharing  you more news feed post from friends who post and tag photos of you, or as  related to locations where you appear in untagged photos.  </p><p>For example, if you're in somebody's profile photo, which is always public,  you'll always be notified.  For other photos, though, you'll only get  notified if you're in the audience for that photo so as to protect the  uploader's privacy, and not alert you about photos you're not allowed to  see.  Facebook says, the feature is designed to give people more control  and make them feel safer because that's the ultimate goal in this society  that they're, at least, that everybody feels safe.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, impersonation is a huge problem on Facebook.  And I had --  somebody came -- was on air with us years ago and literally took, I'm not  joking, more than 30 photos in the building of themselves, and they tagged  me in every single photo and I wasn't in one of them.  And it was like the  most bizarre thing.  And so, why would you do that?  This is way -- this is  another step in preventing some kind of nonsense like that.  </p><p>WILLIS:  If you're not convinced to this?  You can have it undone of your  Facebook.  There's a way to delete it so that you don't have to be part of  this if you don't want to.  But I see what you're saying and makes a lot of  sense for people who are worried about impersonation.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  In fact, delete it from people who are trying to impersonate  people.  In others words --</p><p>WILLIS:  It will just alert.  It will tell you that somebody -- so, Dagen  who've known.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  What I mean is that there's a way in your security options or  something to prevent it from being in effect?  So, for somebody who wants  to try to impersonate somebody else -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Go find those people.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  They can figure it out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will know that something is not right if something's up if  you start like, if I have a pimple on my face and I start getting ads --  no, I start getting ads for Clear Fill.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a proactive face watch.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Dagen, never gets a pimple. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, that's not true.</p><p>KELLY:  I think this highlight, though, the omnipotent power of Facebook,  whether you recognize it or not.  Because they know you're in the photo.   So, you know, whether you're tagged it's you -- they know who are, and  that's how they track.</p><p>WILLIS:  I gave up with privacy a long time ago.</p><p>KELLY:  You are the product.  That's what it is.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Not just that but it's a --</p><p>FORBES:  In a way.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In a way.  We'll leave it.  Gerri, thank you.  Gerri Willis.   Still ahead, cellphone use, a public health issue.  It's what health  officials in California are warning.  The details are coming up on MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, December 20th.</p><p>Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>History making on Capitol Hill -- the Senate approving the largest overhaul  of our nation's tax system in 30 years early this morning.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  When we get this done, when  people see their withholding improving, when they see the jobs occurring,  when they see bigger paychecks, a fair tax system, a simpler tax code --  that's what's going to produce the results.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  The American people  overwhelmingly oppose this bill, punishing or ignoring those who have too  little is a profoundly unpopular idea.  There will be a reckoning.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Eighty percent of taxpayers are going to get a tax cut in the  first year -- 80 percent or more.  There you go.</p><p>The House will vote on that bill later today, likely sending to President  Trump's desk to sign.  And the President says if the bill is approved,  there will be a news conference at the White House this afternoon.</p><p>With the reaction among investors, we have gains across the board -- 85- point gain on the Dow futures.</p><p>Let's go back just a few days.</p><p>Every single major market gauge in the United States closed at a record  high on Monday.  Dow, S&amp;P, Nasdaq, Russell 2000 small cap index, Dow  Transportation stocks even.</p><p>Over in Europe we have some selling to tell you about.  Losses in France  and in Germany, a slight gain on the FTSE 100.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the only market moving higher there was the Nikkei in  Japan.</p><p>Searching for answers in Monday's deadly Amtrak crash -- why investigators  are turning their attention possible driver distraction.</p><p>And cutting the cord, a new study shows Netflix has just as many  subscribers as cable television.</p><p>And then working into your golden years, why most Americans plan to hold a  job well into retirement.</p><p>And forget two all-beef patties, McDonald's unveiling the McVegan burger.   But you'll have to book a trip if you want to try it.  I might just do  that.  I give -- you know what, if McDonalds is testing this globally I  give it a double-thumbs up being a vegan myself.</p><p>Here to break it all down Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle; Benchmark  managing partner Kevin Kelly; and Forbes Media chairman and former  Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes who doesn't know anything  but work -- right?  I mean you enjoy your family but work is fun -- right?  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, work is fun especially when  you get to go to McDonalds and they -- they should change it from McVegan  to McDagen.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, I love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's hilarious.  By the way, can I tell a story?  You -- when  there was a Wendy's in the building after Forbes on Fox taped every Friday.   You took everybody to eat Wendy's every single Friday.  </p><p>FORBES:  It's my version of a spa.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, did you deep your fries in the frosty?   Did you do that at Wendy's?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You do that?</p><p>FORBES:  No.</p><p>KELLY:  No, ok.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I'm sorry -- that's disgusting Kelly.  Kevin -- not me.</p><p>KELLY:  It's a thing.  It's a thing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how we start the 7:00 o'clock hour -- taxes and ketchup  (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>Coming up this morning -- Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge  Napolitano; Louisiana Senator John Kennedy is here; former Republican  presidential candidate Herman Cain; and the administrator of the Small  Business Administration Linda McMahon.</p><p>You don't want to miss any of those find folks.</p><p>But first, Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration about to  deliver on their Christmas promise for tax cuts.  House Republicans set to  give their final approval of the tax reform bill today after the Senate  passed the plan overnight.</p><p>Republican leaders taking a victory lap after the vote.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-WI), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  After eight  straight years of slow growth and underperformance America is ready to take  off.  Stock market is up, optimism is high -- coupled with this tax reform  America is ready to start reforming as it should have for a number of  years.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Democrats have said that the American people will  remember this night.  I hope they do because we passed one of the most  important tax breaks in this country's history.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump tweeting after the vote, \"The United States  Senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut and reform bill.   Terrible individual mandate Obamacare repeal.\"</p><p>Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote.  If approved, there will  be a news conference at the White House, at approximately 1:00 p.m.</p><p>Joining us now is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  subcommittee on tax policy -- Illinois Congressman Peter Roskam.</p><p>Are you surprised that you guys got this done because I certainly am?</p><p>REP. PETER ROSKAM (R), ILLINOIS:  Well look, I live the happy life of low  expectations which is not a bad way to go through life.  But that said,  there's been a lot of folks who have been working on this for years.  I  mean this goes back to the time when Dave Camp was the chairman of the Ways  and Means Committee and then it followed with Paul Ryan as chairman and now  Kevin Brady has brought this to fruition.</p><p>So I'm heartened.  I think it's a foreshadowing of things to come in terms  of legislative accomplishment.  And I think it's a great sense of relief  that the country wakes up this morning saying hey, an institution that it  didn't have a lot of confidence in, that is the United States Congress, has  demonstrated a capacity to get something significant done that has an  impact on every American.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman though -- I will point out one thing that if you  look at these polls in the Wall Street Journal, for example, it's out this  morning that  despite the fact that 80 percent or more of households will  get a tax cut in the first year, 17 percent say their family will pay less  in taxes.  Only 17 percent versus 80 percent who will get a tax cut.  41  percent of Americans in the survey say the tax plan was a bad idea.</p><p>This has actually gotten worse in recent weeks.  I would argue that part of  the problem is that some of the ideas that did wind up in the final bill  were just lousy and process was confusing.  What do you say in terms of why  people don't feel better about this?</p><p>ROSKAM:  Well, the 1986 tax reform package went in front and President  Reagan signed that into law with polling at 18 percent.  So we're pretty  much on par there.  And I think the second thing is polls tend to be all  over the place.  We saw that in the last presidential election.</p><p>And then just going back to this notion of low expectations, this is not a  bad place to be because people are going to see tax relief even though  they're being told by some that they're not.  The business climate is going  to get better even they are being told by some people that they are not. </p><p>So this is one of these bills where the more people come to learn what it  is all about, the more pleased they are going to be.  And the tax relief is  cooked in here and it's incredibly significant.  So for people to come to a  conclusion that they're not going to get tax relief, particularly those in  the middle-income category, it's just not true and that's good news for  them. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, those some that you're talking about, Congressman, they're  Democrats.  They are people across -- they're people across the aisle.   Let's listen to some of the slamming that's been going on.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Yes.  I was being a little bit gentle.  Yes, you're absolutely  right. </p><p>So the -- and I think they made a strategic mistake and they've approached  this in the same way that they approached the health care debate.  And that  was trying to intimidate the GOP not to do something.  And we were  determined to get something done.</p><p>GABRIELLE  Yes.</p><p>ROSKAM: So what they did was they went to hyperbole.  They went to  Armageddon language.  They went to things that were just so completely over  the top.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scam.  Right.  Congressman -- </p><p>ROSKAM:  Yes.  It's just not persuasive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let's listen to what some of those individuals were  saying.  Let's roll that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER:  The Republican tax bill is like pouring gasoline on a raging  fire.  And though the Republican propagandist may call its passage a  political victory, a year from now Republicans will be running away from  this bill in shame for voting yes.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think -- I'm going to hand the baton to Steve Forbes --  Congressman.  But I think the Democrats didn't think that the Republicans  were going to get this done.  And so they used this language and now they  are basically caught flat-footed -- Steve because people are going to get a  tax cut and they are going to have to argue that you keeping more of your  own money is a bad idea somehow -- which is balderdash.  But continue.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, Congressman -- in terms of looking at the future, can you  throw out some anticipation that this is a down payment for more tax cuts  to come if they retain Congress in 2018 -- 2019, revisit this and do more  tax cuts, so give people something to look forward to.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Yes.  There's no question about it.  I mean the idea that tax  policy discussions stop at this point is absolutely not true.  So Steve --  you can look forward to this Ways and Means Committee and others continuing  to examine how to bring more tax relief up and down the spectrum.</p><p>And I think the other thing is, you know, the notion of the Democrats being  caught flat-footed I think is spot on.  They didn't anticipate this moment  when this bill is going to be signed.</p><p>And now they've got to be -- basically be arguing in the alternative.  And  they're arguing process.  They are arguing all other sorts of things.   Meanwhile we're just determined to bring the relief -- </p><p>FORBES:  Congressman -- one of the things that really tied you guys up in  knots I think unnecessarily were these projections from Congressional  Budget Office that underestimated the impact of tax cuts.  Had you consider  a lot of stuff that got you a lot of bad press.  can you really reform CBO  and get realistic projections for the future so you can do vigorous muscle- bound tax -- muscular tax cuts in the future instead of worrying about pay- fors and things like that.  Just do it.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Yes.  So there's been some progress on that basis -- Steve.  As  you know, there's been a shift -- </p><p>FORBES:  But very little.  I know -- 2.6 percent.  We know they can do 3.5  percent, 4 percent in the American economy.</p><p>ROSKAM:  I know.</p><p>FORBES:  So you ask CBO to -- redo the models for CBO.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Yes.  So you're right.  And you're criticism is a valid criticism.  </p><p>There has been a shift over the past few years to insist on dynamic scoring  from the CBO which is a good trend, but there's a lot of more work to be  done.  And in my view, there has been a yielding of congressional authority  to bureaucrats who are unelected, many of whom are in those offices that  yield - -that wield a great deal of influence over the process.  </p><p>FORBES:  But you guys control -- you guys control Congress.  Why don't you  just -- </p><p>ROSKAM:  Tell me about it.  </p><p>FORBES:  -- reform CBO.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Hey, you will find no argument here, my friend.  I'm with you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you don't -- I guess the message from Steve Forbes,  Congressman, is you don't even get a victory lap.  The President hasn't  even signed this into law and he's like what's next, what's next.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  He's saying don't even -- don't even stop for a sip of water.  You  just got to keep going.  God bless him.  </p><p>FORBES:  You can have eggnog.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Eggnog.  He deserves some eggnog after all of this.</p><p>But you do still have business to get done.  Congress has until Friday to  pass a spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown before  Christmas.  House Republicans have been forced to cut back Defense  spending, the $81 dollar disaster aid bill has been broken out for separate  votes.  And the Senate plan to add Obamacare stabilization funds appears to  be dead on arrival in the House.</p><p>I know Lea Gabrielle has a question specifically about avoiding a potential  shutdown -- Lea.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  well, Congressman -- I want to ask you this.  I know one of the  issues that's been discussed on the budget caps, you know, I think in terms  of military and the navy says it wasted $4 million on continuing  resolutions since 2011, essentially put $4 billion in a trash can, pour the  lighter fluid on and burned it.  That's according to navy secretary.</p><p>They're saying that, you know, some of these incidents we are seeing where  sailors have died could be related to the military not being properly  funded.</p><p>So I would like to know -- I'd like to get an update on are you going to  have to pass continuing resolution or are you going to get these budget  caps lifted, what are you anticipating?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Well, I'm anticipating that this gets done, to your point  continuing resolutions are miserable, what they are is just a continuation  of the status quo.  They don't take into account any changes in policy that  has been negotiated and passed by the larger process and it falls very  short.</p><p>But, look, as you know, this is s complicated institution with a wide range  of issues and s wide-range of perspectives up and down the line and very  complicated rules to navigate through.</p><p>I'm confident that the, you know, that the government is going to stay  open, I'm not necessarily confident that we won't continue to have a  continuing resolution of some point for some duration.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Military needs the continuing resolutions to stop.  Every  single military leader is saying that lives are on the line. Because of that.  And I jut want to make that clear. </p><p>ROSKAM:  Yes, there's no argument here.  I think they're right.  And that's  why the House of Representatives has produce 12 appropriations bill which  is hasn't happened in quite some time, so we have done the work and we need  to Senate colleagues to do the same.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well congratulations -- Congressman, because it looked close  there for a time.  But, again, Americans more than 80 percent of taxpayers  are going to get a tax cut in the first year more than 80 percent.</p><p>We make better decisions with our money, I think.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Amen to that.  And I think that's a point that really deserves  focusing in on.  Somebody is going to make a decision about how this money  gets spent. And our views is it's better done in the private sector.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- Congressman Roskam -- good to see you.  Thank you  so much -- </p><p>ROSKAM:  Yes, thanks very much for having me on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Happy holidays.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Merry Christmas.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As speed seems to the leading factor in fatal Amtrak crash in  Washington state, now questions turn to why critical speed control  technology was not active on the train.</p><p>Plus the surprising new statistic about how many people have Netflix  compared to cable -- that's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  New questions on the investigation into the Amtrak train  derailment in Washington State.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti has the details -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi -- Dagen.</p><p>Thorough investigators are trying to find out why that train was traveling  80 miles an hour in a 30-mile-an-hour zone when it went off the tracks,  killing three people and injuring dozens of others.  </p><p>One big question is why speed control technology was not in place to stop  the train automatically.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You are huge supporters of positive train control.  We  have all of our capital allocated to get it done and we've allocated the  capital and put all the resources on it.  There's no one that wants  positive train control more than Amtrak.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The government says that technology must be installed by the  end of next year.  Investigators also say the train's engineer was training  a conductor at the time of the accident raising the question, was he  distracted.</p><p>Ok.  The battle between Netflix versus cable TV, heating up.  A new report  from PWC shows 73 percent of Americans subscribe to cable TV now.  So paid  TV -- that number is down from 79 percent a few years ago.  But it's the  same percentage of people that subscribe to Netflix. </p><p>The report is based on a survey of 2,000 consumers, you're looking at  shares of Netflix.  What a year for them -- up 51 percent.  Next year maybe  Netflix will take the lead.  We will see.</p><p>And did you guys see this, McDonalds targeting vegans not here in the U.S.   It never is.  It's always first in Europe, Sweden and Finland, that's where  they're selling a mixed vegan burger. It is made it's made out of soy, it  comes with tomato, lettuce, pickles, onion, ketchup on a sesame seed bun.  </p><p>It started as a trial back in October but a pretty strong response now,  they're making it a permanent menu item and hopefully bringing it to the  U.S.  I heard it tastes just like a real burger.</p><p>And take a look -- look at that chart, McDonald's on a tear this year, up  more than 40 percent.  Dagen -- I know you're into this.  Me, not so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It doesn't tastes like a hamburger.  It just takes like  something made out of vegetables -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  They've been sort of admitting that -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Vegetable sand toy.  But again, and you know, I'm not of that  thought, like, I just encourage people.  If everybody in the world ate a  little bit less meat and a little more vegetables, it would go such a long  way into, you know, saving lives of some animals in terms of like global  warming, even if people ate less meat.</p><p>You're laughing at me.  </p><p>KELLY:  Climate control -- Dagen.  Everybody </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I'm a carnivore.  I'm not even going there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, but I don't.  But I don't -- what I'm saying is like I don't  freeze like Don't eat me.  Don't' eat me.</p><p>But if you eat a little bit less -- </p><p>FORBES:  Thank God for McDonald's.  That's the only way I eat fish, fish  fillet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You eat the fish fillet?</p><p>Forbes:  It's junk but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, no, no.  I don't shame people.  I don't shame people for  what they eat.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I will say this about McDonalds, when so many people when  they're deployed in the military.  The first thing you want when you get  back is McDonald's hamburger and fries.  And I will tell you -- </p><p>FORBES:  Big Mac.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.  That stuck in my head when I was in Afghanistan.  So many  of us were like can't wait, especially the French fries so.  I don't know  that that has anything to your feeding.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the French fries are vegan I think.  Or at least  vegetarian based on -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  When was the last time you had meat?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Six, seven years ago -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  It's a long time.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Something like that.  I've been a vegan for the last year.  So  there you go.</p><p>Coming up, California in flames -- the inferno outside Los Angeles now the  second biggest wildfire in state history.  How much ground crews have  gained after a break from high winds.</p><p>And working through your golden years -- why more Americans are choosing to  keep their jobs after retirement.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Working during your golden years -- an estimated 56 percent of  American adults plan to work in some capacity even after they retire.</p><p>Joining us to talk about this is Ramsey Solutions financial expert author  of \"Retire Inspired\" Chris Hogan -- who is in studio and I love it.</p><p>This makes sense not just financially, does it, Chris, I mean -- because  again like this is about health and wellness and really being -- happiness.  </p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS:  It really is.  Too many  people associate retirement with the end.  In my mind you start to looks  it, it's an opportunity to do more of the things you want when you want to  do it.  And so more people need to go into it with their eyes wide open  understanding what is my plan, what do I want to do and how am I going to  get there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go ahead.</p><p>KELLY:  Oh sorry -- so we hear retirement and people think 65 -- right.   But is that really even the case now?  I think when I start to see  retirement, it seems more like a 70, you know, it's starting to get to that  age range.  What is actual retirement and how should people start looking  at it?  </p><p>HOGAN:  Well, I talk about it in my book, \"Retire Inspired\".  Retirement  now has nothing to do an with an age, it has everything to with a financial  number.  So I'm trying to get millennials to really wake up and look at  this, start to utilize their 401(k)'s like never before which will put them  actually in a position to be able to retire in their 50s, right.</p><p>Instead of their having to work until they're y0 or 80.  unfortunately  retirement accounts are underfunded right now so people are going to have  to work longer and they'll have to work harder.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go ahead -- Steve.  </p><p>FORBES:  No.  I was just going to ask How many people actually do real work  in terms of planning for retirement, not just financially but what are you  doing next when you wake up in the morning?  </p><p>HOGAN:  Such an important topic -- to be able to look at it and understand  what are you moving toward -- right, everybody knows they are getting away  from that job or that career.  But what's next?</p><p>And I talked with people.  Is it doing mission trips?  Are you starting to  give? Aare you starting a side business or maybe even consulting, a lot of  people have forgot about looking at how do you teach the younger generation  the things you've learned over the last two years or more.</p><p>FORBES:  A lot of are busy but there's not a real purpose to this but  things are connected.  </p><p>HOGAN:  Yes.  Now you're right.  And unfortunately a lot depression can  rise.  If people don't feel like they have a purpose.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think for so many people who are young the idea of being able  to retire sounds really good because I talk to so many millennials right  now who are having a hard time buying a house.  They're having a hard time  getting out from under their college loans.  </p><p>So what are sort of the steps that you put in place for young people to,  you know, to get through those repayments of loan and then to start really  planning for their retirements.</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, the first step is let's acknowledge. You hit the nail on the  head talking about student loan debt.  I mean the average person has 37,000  in student loan debt.</p><p>So what I want them to do to is to attack that debt.  I man with a  vengeance.  Get your money back -- you give yourself a raise when you get  out of debt.  Once you get yourself out of debt, then you can start to  build up an emergency fund.  </p><p>I want people to keep three to six months of expenses tucked away so when  light happens, you have money you can grab.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we were talking about retiring -- another reason to think  twice before you retired.  There's a new study that shows that 20 percent  higher mortality risk, if you claim social security at the aide of 62,  three years premature.</p><p>Why are you -- just take a shot of (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HOGAN:  I know, I know.  I am.  I'm just doing this.  I'm just shaking my  head.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  The government comes after you.  That's amazing.</p><p>HOGAN:  I know I'm shaking my head.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why?  </p><p>HOGAN:  Because mortality has to do with your health -- right.  So all of a  sudden now they've linked your health along with taking social security.   Listen, they are scaring people to death with things like this.</p><p>Some people didn't have enough put away, Dagen, so they're going to have to  take social security a little bit earlier.  It doesn't mean you're going to  pass away just because you tap in to social security.  Not at all.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I understand this though.  My grandfather worked and the day  that he stopped working he died within a year after that.  Of course, he  was in his 80s.</p><p>HOGAN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there is this.  I've known a lot -- a number of individuals  who continue to work and it was like they lost their sense of purpose.  And  maybe it didn't kill them but it certainly impacted their quality of life  and their mental health after they stopped working.  </p><p>HOGAN:  Well, Steve brought that up.  Talking about having something else  you're going toward.  Whether you're plugging in with charities, but you  have to do something you're passionate about.  You can't go and just sit on  the front porch for the next 15 or 20 years.  And the people have -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can.  I'm from the south.  I can sit on a porch all day long.  </p><p>HOGAN:  Dagen -- you would not sit on a porch longer than five minutes.   You are busy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's true.</p><p>HOGAN:  But you know, a lot of people I think when they start to think  about what can I do -- talking with other people, networking, and pursuing  some things that you're passionate about, it'll still keep you engaged and  excited.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick -- the tax plan can make people think twice about  where they spend their golden years.  Where are the best states for  retirement?  I've, always said pick a state that has low health care costs,  good access to health care, lower healthcare costs.  What do you say?  </p><p>HOGAN:  Well, I would say just do your homework so you can look at it and  understand.  Wyoming keeps popping up -- from health care costs, property  taxes.  I've been to Wyoming.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's cold.  </p><p>HOGAN:  It's cold.  You know, but -- </p><p>FORBES:  No state income tax.  </p><p>HOGAN:  No state income tax and Tennessee, Florida, Michigan -- all those  places.  But do your homework and understand where is your quality of life  going to be best.  And that's typically associated with where do you have  family -- right.  </p><p>When get older we want to spend more time with family and grandkids so know  those options.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You need people to take care of you, too.</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, you're not supposed to say that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I'm saying it.  I'm saying it your relatives are moving to  your awesome state of Tennessee, they are really hoping you're going to  help take care of them because they didn't save enough money when they were  younger.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  -- which is a good point, attack your debt when you are young,  right.  Because some one evil pays so much more for things like homes,  cars, et cetera because they get into debt.  </p><p>HOGAN:  That's right.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And that's one thing -- </p><p>HOGAN:  No, You're absolutely right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, I'm going to spring this on you.  One of the changes  in the tax bill, 401(k) borrowers have more time to repay their loan.  </p><p>HOGAN:  I know it.  Now listen.  I know but I want to get -- you're getting  me riled up -- Dagen.  But listen don't touch your 401(k).  You put that  money away to be able to live your dreams, don't tap into it, leave it  alone.  There are all kinds of penalties associated with it and it's not  worth the stress.</p><p>The way to grow money, Dagen -- you all know this, time and compound  interest. So let the money sit there and leave it alone..  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You still have to repay the loan if you leave the company by the  day you file your tax returns, used to be 60, you only had 60 days after  the departure.  I'm saving that argument for another day.  </p><p>Chris Hogan -- </p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had to work that in there.</p><p>HOGAN:  Good to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Happy holidays, my friend.  Happy holidays.  Coming up, grilled  behind closed doors, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe facing nearly eight  hours of questioning over alleged anti-Trump bias in that Russia probe.</p><p>Judge Andrew Napolitano will weigh in on the legal implication.  And second  time's the charm for the Georgia Dome, the remaining pieces of the stadium  coming down in a planned implosion overnight.  The stunning video straight  ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, December 20th.  Your top stories at 7:30 am Eastern.</p><p>Tax reform moving one step closer to the president's desk.  After the  Senate passed the plan in an overnight vote, the House is now set for a  final vote this morning.  </p><p>The White House insisting businesses and taxpayers alike will see the  benefits.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We expect that it  likely will certainly on the personal side could cost the president a lot  of money.  </p><p>Again, the president's focus hasn't necessarily been at all on himself,  priority number one being that it helps the American middle class.  </p><p>We know that this bill does that, and that's one of the biggest reasons  that the president has supported it, been engaged, and will look forward to  signing hopefully in the coming days.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump tweeting overnight that he'll hold a news  conference following the House vote.  Fox Business will have full coverage.</p><p>After all of the tax action, futures are showing gains across the board.   Eight-eight point gain on the Dow futures, headed to another all-time high  potentially, if they can hang onto those gains, moving into the trading  day.  </p><p>In Europe, we have some losses in France and Germany to show you, down  about one-fifth of a percent on the CAC quarante and the DAX.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, only one market heading higher there, the Nikkei up one- tenth of a percent.

Waymo now partnering with an insurance  tech startup to protect passengers when the service goes live next year.  </p><p>We will tell you more coming up.  And down goes the Georgia Dome for the  second time.  What's left of the stadium imploding once again this morning  after part of it failed to collapse last month.  We do have video locked up  it for you. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  You know who's on.  You can hear that laugh.  Your top  story this half hour.  Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe spent nearly eight  hours testifying behind closed doors yesterday for his role in the alleged  anti-Trump bias of the special counsel rush investigation.  </p><p>Now it appears that McCabe may be back for another round.  Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Oversight Committee Chairman Trey  Gowdy want McCabe and other senior FBI officials available for questioning  over the alleged anti-Trump bias in both the Clinton e-mail and Trump  Russia probe.  </p><p>And they're looking to interview them as early as this week.  Joining me  now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, peel back  this onion.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I wish I could  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Explain what's going on.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I wish I could peel back the onion, but it's difficult because  these interrogations keep taking place in secret.  </p><p>So we will soon have a Republican version of what happened when some  Republican decide to say we asked in this and they couldn't answer it.</p><p>And a Democratic version of what happened when they say we asked in this  and this is what he told us.  And the government will continue to treat the  American people as children rather than as the owners of the government  that we are where we have an -- we are entitled to transparency and to know  what happen.  </p><p>I hope that some courageous soul leaks a transcript of this, so we can see  what happened.  If Andrew McCabe misused government power, power we gave  him for partisan purposes, we are entitled to know it.  </p><p>If on the other hand, this is a stunt and inquisition by Congress to make  something look like something that it really isn't, we are entitled to know  that.  </p><p>We won't know it as long as they keep holding these hearings in secret.   The Republicans want to show that the FBI had an anti-Trump bias and  therefore, the Mueller investigation is tainted.  </p><p>The Democrats want to show that the FBI is not choir boys.  They always  have a bias against whoever they're investigating and you should expect  that from Mueller and everybody else.  </p><p>And let the courts worry about fairness.  The American people will decide  which version, if we ever find out what happened, they believe.</p><p>KELLY:  But will he really say anything?  I mean, it's behind closed doors,  but couldn't he say, hey, I need to differ?  Can he then take the fifth,  like what can actually come from this?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you can't selectively take the fifth, Kevin.  You have  to take the fifth on everything.  That's pretty much the law everywhere in  the United States.  I doubt -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even if he needs private grilling. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Somebody potential could come in and say I'm not going to answer  any of this question.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He could say, I'm not going to answer.  But he can't use his  right against self-incrimination as a reason.  He can use the following as  a reason.</p><p>The Inspector General of the Justice Department is investigating all of  this and he has asked us not to reveal what we told him until his report  comes out.  How do we know that that's a standard answer? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know how.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Where (INAUDIBLE) Rod Rosenstein -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- gave last week.  Now, they asked Rosenstein -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Chris Wray, didn't Chris Wray? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes.  This really -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The head of the FBI uses that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.  So two Donald Trump appointees confirmed with heavy  majorities in the Senate, Rod Rosenstein, the number two person, the Chief  Operating Officer of the Justice Department.  </p><p>Chris Wray the Director of the FBI, and the Republicans that threatened to  hold the two of them in contempt.  When is the last time a Republican  Congress threatened to hold Republican appointees in contempt?</p><p>But here's the tantalizing thing when Rod Rosenstein, number two in the  Justice Department was asked last week, did the FBI pay for the Steele  dossier?</p><p>His answer was, I know the answer and I'm not telling him.  I'm pulling my  hair out at this point, because we've all been trying to find this out.  </p><p>That probably the type of answer that Andrew McCabe gave last night.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even with a -- he was there behind closed doors for eight hours.   Is there -- is -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Was a long time.  They didn't start at 2:00 in the afternoon  which is why they went until 10:00 at night.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is there any way -- there's no way you can read into the time  that he spent behind closed doors, because they could have just been asking  questions he might have been saying all -- about load of nothing.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, in my tradition, Steve, is familiar with this one,  when a question is asked that is improper, somebody says, objection and the  judge rules on it.</p><p>That is not the procedure here.  Each member of Congress gets five minutes  first round, five minutes second round, five minutes third round.</p><p>They can ask whatever they want.  Somebody else can object, they still get  to ask it.  So we don't know how aggressive the questioning was, and we've  (INAUDIBLE) until the transcript is leaked.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN &amp; EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA:  So what's your  saying is, they're not going to do anything until the Inspector General  report it Department of Justice comes out.  When is that going to come out?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Spring.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, we don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  April?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We don't know.  Probably, the spring.  But I don't know that  they're going to do anything even then.  I don't think they want to do  anything until Mueller is concluded.</p><p>He's either going to indict more people or exonerate some people.   Exonerate the president then his efforts become a footnote in history.</p><p>If he charges the president with something, it's a whole new can of worms.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are we going to get full exoneration from Mueller?  Will he  given -- will he -- what -- because again -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is how you say it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know the answer to that.  I tend to agree with Steve.   I doubt it.  He wants to justify his existence.  But here's something  tantalizing, today is Wednesday, tomorrow Thursday, Bob Mueller personally  meets with President Trump's lawyers.  </p><p>What the heck are they going to talk about?  First, face-to-face meeting  during this investigation.  These are the people who told the president in  August, don't worry about it, it'll be over by Thanksgiving.  Over by  Thanksgiving.  It's Christmas and it's still heating up.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Judge, you're being pretty hard on this close session and this  close meeting.  But when you look at the organization like the FBI,  intelligence organization, the FBI is an intelligence organization like the  CIA.  </p><p>In order to have Congressional oversight, they have to have close meeting,  because things like sources and methods of how they do their investigation,  how they obtain things has to be able to be kept secret.  So don't you see  some volatility of that? </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're so good and so pro-government.  So does the government  work -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  No.  I am -- I am pro -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Does the government work -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I am pro -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- (INAUDIBLE) they work for the government.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  -- (INAUDIBLE) our government employees who have dedicate their  lives to serving our country -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  -- intelligence community -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  -- to supporting them and helping them do their jobs properly.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So you trust -- </p><p>FORBES:  But that gets to your point, release the transcript and redact  process -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  (INAUDIBLE) don't leak.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, this is why such a successful -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Leaking is a crime.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Such a successful business -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Redacted.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- he can negotiate anything.  In fact, common ground between  us right here.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  We have lots of common.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We are not talking about the entire Intelligence community.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're talking about Peter Strzok who clearly had bias -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- maybe he's acted on that bias -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- which is illegal. </p><p>GABRIELLE:  No.  But you're talking about things like how -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In his role -- but in his role investigating -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Hillary Clinton, in his role investigating Donald Trump and  the transition, and the campaign.  That's what people are angry about.</p><p>It's -- we just want to get to the bottom of it.  We just want to -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  you know -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- know why would -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Fair not redacted, not leak.  Thank you for that (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, look, we do want to get to the bottom of it.  But the  American public needs to know that FBI ints are not choir boys.</p><p>If they were, the bad guys would run all over us.  We don't want them to be  choir boys.  They're entitle of the same political opinion as the rest of  us.</p><p>I'm not a friend of Strzok.  I've never met him.  And I'm not going to  defend him.  But if all of those text messages came out, you'll see as many  against Eric Holder.  He's (INAUDIBLE) at that time -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's true.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- as he did against candidate Donald Trump.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's true.  There are -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's the guy with a lot of opinions. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- kept messages -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Like the rest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Just always -- I'll just remind people if you ever talk to  the FBI they can lie to you but you can't lie to them, and they will throw  you in the hoosegow.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Just ask Martha Stewart (ph). </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure, guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  Coming up, protecting passengers in  driverless cars.  Waymo working with an insurance startup that'll cover you  in case of an accident in an autonomous vehicle.</p><p>Cell phone use, a public health issue.  That's what health officials are in  California are warning.  The details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Firefighters in Southern California bracing for a new round of  powerful winds.  Lauren Simonetti has the details.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  The Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa  Barbara County is now the second largest wildfire in California history.  </p><p>It's been burning since December 4th.  The good news is it's 55 percent  contained, because they had a few days of calmer wind. </p><p>Those strong winds are expected to return tonight.  Fire officials do not  anticipate full containment until January 8th.  Thousands of people still  under evacuation orders.  </p><p>Well, South Carolina's capital City of Columbia is banning bump stocks.   Their new law bans the attachment of these devices weapon in city limit.  </p><p>The device can turn semiautomatic rifle basically into machine guns.

Waymo is teaming up  with a startup called Trov to cover passengers in autonomous vehicle.</p><p>Trov will insure rider for property damage as well as for injury.  Waymo,  of course, plans to launch their ride-hailing service in Phoenix in 2018.</p><p>Taking a look at shares of Alphabet which is the parent company of Waymo,  up over 30 percent this year.  Well, it might not had been as big an  explosion as the first one.  But the second one got the job done.  </p><p>We're showing you video.  Early this morning where you could see the  remaining pieces of the Georgia Dome coming down.  You guys remember when  the dome was first imploded last month and two sections did not fall?</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And then who can forget this when the city bus, yes, there it is, the MARTA  bus blocked the view of onlookers.  I mean, this was history being made.  </p><p>So I think they had some better luck today.  But, of course, not so much  drama.  Hi, bus.  Now, get out of the way.  After the Georgia Dome was  already imploded.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love it.  Thank you.  I never get enough of that video.  Thank  you, Lauren.  Coming up, they promise to be healthy but are they safe?  New  detail on the government crackdown on homeopathic remedies.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The California Department of Public Health has a message for  cell phone users.  A new study shows long-term cell phone use may cause  health risk from radiation exposure.  </p><p>Joining us in this morning is family medical doctor Mikhail Varshavski.   Dr. Mike, are cell phones are health threat?</p><p>MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, DOCTOR, OVERLOOK MEDICAL CENTER:  Well, what I like  about that study is that it said may cause pose a threat.  And that's a  very important word that we focus on here, because we don't have definitive  proof that they cause health harm, at least physical health harm.</p><p>We know mental risk with cell phones definitely exist for people sitting on  social media, for people that stay up late at night using their cell  phones, but we're talking about physical risk here.</p><p>I'm really proud of the California Department of Health, because while they  say that it's not certain that there's health risks, there are steps you  could do to mitigate if that risk does exist.  </p><p>And there are simple steps.  Don't kip your cell phone in your pocket if  you're not using it, keep it a few feet away from you; don't sleep with the  cell phone underneath your pillow, because that extra radiation exposure  that you don't need.  </p><p>So it's really practical advice, there's no side effects to following this  advice.  It just smart all around.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you know it'll be taken a step further.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's -- for years, people have preached me that -- you know,  that you get brain cancer -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- from using a cell phone.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  My mom has been concerned about this for long time.  So I'm  just going to move my cell phone away from me and put closer to Kevin  Kelly.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes.  Give me all the radiation.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well, it's important to know the different types of radiations  that exist.  So when you get a CAT scan or an x-ray, that's ionizing  radiation.</p><p>That's the radiation that if given large doses or overtime will cause  cancer.  That's proven.  Non-ionizing radiation which is the radiation  that's admitted by your cell phone, generally is safe.  </p><p>So that's why we don't make a big deal about the radiation that's admitted  by cell phone.  Because Wi-Fi releases the same thing.  </p><p>And now, Wi-Fi is all over the city.  So we tend to not get too excited  unless we have definitive proof here.  Because think about the health  benefit that come from using cell phone, in an emergency situation -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  -- or doctor's communicating with each other?  I mean, I'm on  my cell phone talking to my patients, to the ER, to other doctors all the  time.  So -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So Dr. Mike, my theory is good news.  But let's move on to some  -- a spoonful of sugar no longer advised to help the medicine go down.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration is cracking down out on homeopathic  remedies targeting those with potentially harmful ingredient.  What's your  stand on this?  I get this, because again, this is, kind of, a very  unregulated area of the world or, you know, even vitamins for example.  </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And people misuse them.  This -- we talk about doses being way  too high.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.  So I'm not a fan that the FDA doesn't regulate vitamins  in the supplement industry.  However, homeopathic medications are  medications.  </p><p>They're not just vitamins.  So these are actively toxic substances that are  being prescribed to people by homeopathic practitioners, they're not  doctors.  And some of those toxic substances cause illness.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like what?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Belladonna.  It's a poisonous plant that creates a poisonous  berry is given to children that are teething and have resulted last year in  400 injuries and 10 deaths.  This is -- </p><p>KELLY:  Is this cleared by the FDA or not cleared by the FDA?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They can -- go ahead.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  This is a very important distinction here, the homeopathic  medicines are technically supposed to follow the same approval process as  any prescription drug out there.  </p><p>However, 1988, they created distinction that gives the FDA some flexibility  in not enforcing all of these policies.  Now, they've realized that they've  gone too loose for too long, and there's harm coming from this.  </p><p>Not only our patients ingesting substances that are dangerous for them, but  some are forgoing good medical care that will help them, that has proven  benefit in order to get homeopathic care.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Is the FDA tracking down on based of the advertising of these  homeopathic drugs or medicines or is it just trying to more, like, limit  the access to it?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So it's both, it's advertising, the way that the product -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Advertising, they have like the FCC has -- </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  FCC, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The FCC can crackdown on any kind of false advertising -- </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- regardless of who's doing it.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well, the FDA, what their job is to make sure that medications  don't get approved for a certain subject.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  OK.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So if -- there are so many of these substances that are out  there, because they're all considered natural.  And again, for those of you  at home, natural does not equal healthy.  Arsenic is natural -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you can take too much vitamin D and wind up -- </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- wind up with a face flush.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Exactly.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Quite, frankly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  And last thing, I have to say for doctors, while we know that  homeopathic stuff right now has not been proven.  We have to keep an open  mind -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  -- because pathologic disbelief doesn't help anybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  Dr. Mike, love it.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Still ahead there are so many animals who need good homes.   That's Ramon and Charlie.  We can tell you how you can adopt and rescue an  animal.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I'm picking Charlie.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Next hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

The Senate making history, Republicans approving the largest  overhaul of our country's tax system, moving the bill one step closer to  President Trump's desk.  The House will vote on t his bill later today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES:  And when people see the withholdings go down in February  when they see their tax cuts, that's going to change the view of this  because it's going to give us better jobs, higher wages, bigger paychecks  and a simplified system and people are going to get their taxes cut.   That's good for everybody.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump says if the bill is approved there will be a  news conference at the White House this afternoon.  Futures are showing  gains across the board, an 89-point gain on the Dow futures, we could wind  up with record-highs on all year major market gages.  Watch the NASDAQ  Composite, maybe it hit that 7,000 mark.  In Asia -- In Europe, let's go  over there, losses to report in France and Germany, and in Asia overnight,  stocks mostly lower as well, the Nikkei the sole gainer there.  </p><p>Tragedy in Mexico, a tour bus carrying American cruise ship passengers  crashes killing the least 12 people.

Steve Forbes, also Fox News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle,  Benchmark managing partner, Kevin Kelly.  Forbes media chairman, former  Republican Presidential candidate.  All around awesome dude.  Steve Forbes,  a Scotsman.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Call me my lord.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because you always make -- can I say this?  You always make  jokes about your brother because he regifts things at Christmas.  </p><p>FORBES:  Oh my god.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen just made that up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I didn't.</p><p>FORBES:  No she didn't.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I didn't.  No, his brother --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  His brother is notorious for regifting things because again,  that's kind of the Scotsman in you guys.</p><p>FORBES:  Wow.  It's called recycling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Recycling.  Excuse me.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You said that on air.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: It's actually putting --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY: It's actually putting goods and services at its highest and best  uses.  So you're actually just redeploying them to their best use, right?   I mean, that's the capitalist.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody who denies regifting doesn't. </p><p>KELLY:  I just have to say one thing real quick about the market, we talked  about the futures.  I just want to say that next year I think we're going  to see record-breaking highs off of this tax reform package that goes  through. A lot of the Wall Street analyst have not put it in their  estimates for next year, so we will see once they revised those estimates  we will see the stock market go higher.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just from -- just from that and we'll move on to that.  Just  from the corporate tax cut.  Tony Dwyer yesterday says there is a 15  percent additional gain in the S&amp;P just based on the earnings that are  added to those S&amp;P 500 companies.  So --</p><p>FORBES:  So we don't need to regift next year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.  No excuses.  </p><p>KELLY: Yes, my lord.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Christmas 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't give anything away, I -- you said that on air before.   Joining us -- this morning.  </p><p>FORBES:  I know about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Republican Presidential candidate Herman Cain, Small Business  Administrator Linda McMahon, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  You  don't want to miss any of these great terrific people.  But first, on the  verge of a tax victory.  Republican set to give their final approval to a  sweeping tax overhaul today after the Senate passed the plan overnight.   House leaders scheduled a final vote this morning on the plan sending it to  the President's desk to sign and law shortly.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell says, both American businesses and individuals will see the  benefits. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  We had three -- two  quarters in a row of three percent growth. Stock market is up, optimism is  high, coupled with this tax reform, America is ready to start reforming as  it should have for a number of years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President congratulating lawmakers on Twitter writing this.   The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut and  reform bill.  Terrible individual mandate, Obamacare repealed, goes to the  House tomorrow morning for final vote.  If approved, there will be a news  conference at the White House at approximately 1:00 p.m.  Joining us now  from Capitol Hill, member of the Senate Judiciary and Budget Committee,  Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana.  Senator, assuming the House passes this  bill this morning which it already passed -- it already passed it and there  was change slightly.  When do you expect the President to sign this?  </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Quickly as he gets it.  It's what he's  told us because I think he believes as I do that this is -- this bill is  going to have a breathtakingly positive impact on the American people.  I  mean I wouldn't have voted for it if I thought otherwise.  Duh.  You know,  I mean -- and look, I know the Democrats are against it.  But you can  explain if their opposition very simply.  There are two groups of people up  here in Washington and maybe two groups of the media.  There are those who  believe that you and I, people can spend money they earn better than  government and then there's a second group that believes government can.   And most of my Democratic colleagues, god bless them and think,  well, we  all just give all of our money to government because government is smarter  than we are and they can make better decisions.  And I don't believe that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Senator, Steve Forbes is here.  He has a question for you.  </p><p>FORBES:  Senator.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  I read -- I read your magazine, Mr. Forbes.  </p><p>FORBES:  We (ph) have that bright look about you.  Thank you.</p><p>KENNEDY:  I'm joyed. </p><p>FORBES:  But on -- one of the criticisms of the tax bill is that the  individual cuts many of them expired whereas the business ones seem to have  eternal life.  How do you -- how do you answer that and how are you going  to cure that next year, the year after we can take these expire dates off  of these tax cuts?  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, I answer it this way, Steve.  That's only half the story.   I mean, on the one hand, the Democrats have said, you don't care about the  deficit.  Well, why do you think we didn't make the personal income tax  cuts permanent?  Because we were living within our means, the $1.5 trillion  guardrail.  Now, President Bush's tax cuts were \"Temporary too\" and they  became permanent after they were rolled over.  The personal income tax cuts  when they supposedly expire in 2025 will never expire.  They will be rolled  over.  So, our critics on that part of the bill are a little disingenuous  in my opinion.  </p><p>FORBES:  Is there -- are you ever going to get to a time when you're going  to finally shuck off these self-imposed restraints of CBO when we know  their numbers like their low -- their estimates, the tax cuts really don't  work for the economy.  We know those numbers are fake, why do we still them  as if they're gospel truth.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, I read the CBO report, I mean, I listen to CBO and JCT and  NBA and I read all their reports.  But there -- in some cases persuasive  but for me, they're not dispositive.  I have found in the last eight years  as the American economy has gotten more sophisticated, it does by the day  and we're part of the global economy that for every economist there is an  equal opposite economist and often times are both wrong.  Now I have -- I  have --</p><p>FORBES:  The average -- the average American growth rate is about 3 and  third -- 3-1/2 percent.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  </p><p>FORBES:  CBO have 1.9 or 2.6 you raised it too from these crazy estimates.   Why don't you just put in 3-1/2 then you have all these more glorious tax  cuts.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, the recent uptick in our GDP I think has been a result of  two things.  First, it's been in (INAUDIBLE) people and business people and  especially I'm looking forward to the tax cuts so they can invest more in  their business.  The second reason that I think we have same uptick is  because President Trump has -- Trump has done an extraordinary job of  getting rid of some of the rules and regulations.  President Obama added  about $122 billion, not million, but billion of new regs and we're rolling  them back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Senator, but I do -- I do want to get to this issue because it's  like a lot of the Senators that really in this tax reform plan, you stuck  it to us folks in the blue states, in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,  and out in California.  If you look at the popularity so far there is a  Wall Street Journal poll that's just out, 41 percent of Americans say the  tax plan is a bad idea.  Only 17 percent of people believe that they're  going to get a tax cut.  And Mike Block who is on this show very often e- mailed me and he said, listen, it's -- a part of it is because people in  red states keep talking about places like New York being -- </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that we're getting a handout from people in terms of the tax  code and there's a limitation now only $10,000 on the state and local and  property tax deduction.  And so, they are not feeling like they're going to  get any benefit from this despite the fact that the numbers show 80 percent  of Americans will get a tax cut in the first year.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, let me -- let me answer your question straight-on.  I think  -- I think the American people are very smart.  They may not read Aristotle  every day but they're smart.  The reason they don't know every provision in  the tax code is because they're too busy earning a living.  I mean, they  can't sit and watch T.V. all day and learn about this stuff.  It's  complicated.  I've spent over 300 hours working on this bill.  But I think  once American people learn more about it and once American people have the  higher take-home pay and see their business growing and see their employer  growing, I think they're going to feel very good about this and in terms of  -- if I can just finish.  </p><p>In terms of the so-called high-tax -- high state and local tax states,  California, New York, New Jersey, yes.  For some people, if you're making  500 grand a year and you're paying property taxes for $35,000 to $40,000  thousand, you're going to pay more.  You are -- and we tried to soften to  blow by reducing the top marginal tax rate down to 35 but there's just no  way you can -- you can make everybody happy when you do legislation this  massive.  I mean, not only did we do the tax bill, we affected Obamacare,  rolled back some of it, we did and we're drilling.  This is a very broad  deal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick.  Are we going to shut down you think?  </p><p>KENNEDY:  I don't want to shut down.  I will vote to shudder down in a  heartbeat if they try to make me swallow something that I don't think is  good for America or good for my state but I don't think that's going to  happen.</p><p>FORBES:  Senator, what's this -- we read about the dispute, the alleged  dispute between you and Don McGhan at the White House over judicial  appointments.  Can you enlighten us on that?  </p><p>KENNEDY:  I wouldn't read everything, I believe everything you read.  I'm  doing my job as a member of the Judiciary panel.  And when somebody -- let  me put it this way.  I thought my questions of Mr. Peterson were very fair.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We should -- Senator, we should just explain to folks who don't  know the story.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  OK.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That it was one of President Trump's judicial nominees, Matthew  Peterson withdraw his name from consideration after he struggled to answer  some pretty basic legal questions that you posed him.  Posed to him during  the Senate hearing.  Let's just watch a little quick piece of video of that  exchange.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KENNEDY:  Have you ever tried a jury trial?  </p><p>MATTHEW PETERSEN, TRUMP JUDICIAL NOMINEE:  I have not.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Civil?  </p><p>PETERSEN:  No.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Criminal?  </p><p>PETERSEN:  No.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Bench?</p><p>PETERSEN: No.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  State or Federal court?  </p><p>PETERSEN: I have not.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  As a trial judge you're obviously going to have witnesses.</p><p>PETERSEN: Yes.</p><p>KENNEDY:  As a trial judge, you're obviously going to have witnesses.  Can  you tell me what the Daubert standard is? </p><p>PETERSEN:  Sen. Kennedy, I don't have that readily at my disposal but I  would be happy to take a closer look at that.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Just for the record, do you know what a motion in limine is?</p><p>PETERSEN:  I would probably not be able to give you a good definition right  here at the table.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: Do you know what a motion in limine is?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Senator, please continue.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, I was just going to say, Mr. Peterson is a good guy, I read  his FBI background report.  But if you got a brain beyond a single cell  organism and you got a law degree and you've got any experience whatsoever,  you know what the Daubert case is, some call it Dover, in Louisiana we say  Daubert.  And I think Mr. Petersen is good election law, very good  apparently but he's not a trial lawyer and he's not qualified to sit on the  federal bench especially not in D.C.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Senator, thank you so much for being here.  We covered a lot of  ground.  Senator John Kennedy, take care.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Merry Christmas.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Happy holidays.  You did deliver a Christmas gift for folks.  We  just don't feel it for a couple months I think.  Thank you, sir.  Coming  up.  Another roadblock for Uber in Europe.  Details on the new ruling that  hit that ride-sharing giant overseas.  And the lords and ladies of  Connecticut, why Scotland is giving residents a one small town their own  land.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A tour bus crash in Mexico leaves at least 12 people dead  including several Americans.  Lauren Simonetti has the details.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: The bus was carrying crew ship passengers,  Dagen, on an excursion in Mexico when it flipped over on a highway  yesterday, killing at least 12 people, 20 others injured including seven  Americans.  Royal Caribbean cruise line says passengers from two of its  ships were on that bus.  And investigators are working to determine the  cause of the crash.  </p><p>Well, the E.U. dealing a major setback to Uber.  The European court of  justice is ruling that Uber should be regulated as a cab company and not as  digital service.  Uber has been trying to use the courts to reduce its  regulatory oversight claiming, hey, we're just (INAUDIBLE) that connects  the driver to the passenger.  They also add the ruling should not have an  immediate impact on its European operations but it does raise the questions  about to get the economy going forward.</p><p>Well, Bank of America now offering paid sabbaticals to some of its  employees at their global banking and markets decision.  You can take time  off between four and six weeks and get paid for it.  In addition to your  vacation time, if you worked at the bank for at least a decade.  Employees  can use this sabbatical for an opportunity to travel or recharge, whatever.   But some bankers fear, look if we take this extra time it could cause  promotions.  Shares of the bank are up 33 percent this year.  I'm still  thinking about it.  Would I take a sabbatical?  I've been here 1- years,  Fox.</p><p>All right.  (INAUDIBLE) ladies.  Residents of Scotland as in Connecticut  are becoming just that, lords and ladies.  The Scottish land preservation  company gifting all 1700 residents in the town one square foot of land on  its nature reserve.  That comes with the courtesy titles of lord and  ladies.  The company sells forest lands so they cannot be developed and  these residents have to call town hall to get their free plot.  I'd do it.   Like there is about two hours from Greenwich, anybody nearby?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am.  I'm Scottish descent sort of.  </p><p>FORBES:  Sort of?  What about access to your one square foot?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I don't know if I can -- I could fix -- </p><p>FORBES:  That was the answer, there was a serial that gave you a deed  inside the serial box to one square inch of land in Canada, then they got  in trouble because you couldn't actually (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love that.  I'm glad -- I love that.  I love that you're here,  Steve.  Coming up.  Revving the economic engine.  Former Presidential  Candidate Herman Cain tells us how he expects tax reform to impact the  economy.  And say cheese of fast-food giant comes up with a new way to  order a burger that will put a smile on your face.  And spend the holidays  with your new best friend.  That's my Charlie.  That's Charlie dog.  We're  going to tell -- talk to animal care center here in New York City about  finding a dog a home just in time for Christmas.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To our top story, lawmakers on the verge of putting sweeping tax  reform on the President's desk.  Will this plan help grow this economy?   Our next guess says this tax bill stimulates economic growth.  How much?   He is here to tell you.  Former Republican Presidential Candidate, Fox News  Contributor, Herman Cain.  Herman, how much will the -- how much can this  plan -- as it stands, about ready to be signed in the law juice this  economy? </p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I believe that it can generate GDP  growth of three percent plus.  We just don't know how much plus.  But I'm  confident that it will do that.  Steve Forbes, one of your panelists also  knows this because of his business background.  Remember I was on a board  of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in the early 1990's.  We  routinely saw GDP growth of four percent and higher.  When the tax breaks  were right and when businesses were excited.  That's what this tax  legislation does.  It continues the excitement and momentum of the business  community and that means they are going to look at growing their  businesses, they're going to look at reward in their employees and they are  going to look at rewarding some of their stockholders.  </p><p>KELLY: Herman, it's Kevin Kelly.  I completely agree with you.  I think for  the past 25 years, the American economy has been hampered by a 35 percent  rate and you've seen corporations start to shift their business services  overseas to go to lower corporate tax rates.  They have trillions of  dollars there because of it.  One of the arguments I'm hearing that's very  popular coming from typically the left side is that, listen, this isn't  really going to translate to increased wages, this, you know, we're already  at a three percent GDP for it.  How long do you think it takes effect and  do you think this can raise wages going forward because we're starting to  hear arguments on the other side that incorporations aren't going to  increase wages?  </p><p>CAIN:  Those arguments are false.  And here is why.  50 years, I have been  in the workforce.  I have served on five corporate boards.  Let me tell you  what that priorities are.  Number one, grow that business.  Number two,  take care of the better-performing employees, and number three, reward the  stockholders.  Now, given those three top priorities, I have never sat on a  board and asked Steve Forbes the same question, where they talk about  getting smaller or staying stagnant.  Those arguments are absolutely false  and they simply want to ignore the facts.  You know, Kevin, there used to  be an old saying, you know, facts don't lie and liars use facts.  Today,  it's facts don't lie and liars don't even bother to look at the facts.  So  that's why they are making these erroneous statements because they know  that some people are gullible enough to believe it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Steve.</p><p>FORBES:  Herman, Steve Forbes here.  Merry Christmas, happy New Year and  all of that especially the tax cut. </p><p>CAIN:  To you also, Steve.  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  Do you think the confusion about pass-throughs is going to hurt --  how long is it going to take for our small business people to sort all of  that out?  They made it unnecessarily very complex.  </p><p>CAIN:  I believe it's going to take them a little while to sort it out but  by the time this tax legislation goes into effect, they will have figured  it out.  And see, this is the 20 percent deduction off of profits if you  make money is really easy for small businesses and pass-throughs to  understand.  And this is what Senator Ron Johnson's fought so hard for  which when small business people figure out that this is a net plus.  I  think that they will be excited about it.  I think that is a good move to  help continue job growth and job creation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman, just to switch gears quickly really.  Artificial  Intelligence hitting fast-food chains?  You ran a restaurant chain many  years ago, it's one of the great things you've done.  Caliburger is the  country's first kiosk that uses facial recognition to let customers reorder  items.  I want to know what you think of this.  </p><p>CAIN:  Well, in the interest of this digital revolution, I am not surprised  that those sort of innovations are being developed.  But let me tell you  something, Dagen, that I know from my experience in the quick service  business, you can't automate a smile.  And I'm not talking about the smile  of the customer, you can't automate the smile of the person serving you.   That kiosk will not have an automated Artificial Intelligence smile.   That's what they are going to be giving up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that gets an amen and a hallelujah for me.  And a thank you.   Herman Cain, thank you so much.</p><p>CAIN:  Merry Christmas and happy New Year to everybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Merry Christmas, sir.</p><p>CAIN:  And today, Dagen, is going to be a day of celebration. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  And you know what, people will be celebrating in the  weeks or months to come when they realizes the Democrats have been lying to  them and they're getting to keep more of the money that they earned.  Thank  you, Herman.  Still ahead.</p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Still ahead.  Breaking down what tax reform means for you.  We  will talk to the small business administrator Linda McMahon about the  bill's potential impact on smaller businesses.  And Stitch Fix unravels  after its first post IPO earnings report.  What is causing investor  concerns this morning?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It is  Wednesday, December 20th.

Hell  no, you can't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the Democrats didn't but the Republicans got in line and  the House will vote on the updated bill today, likely sending it to the  President's desk.  We'll talk to small business administrator Linda McMahon  about how this tax reform will impact the business that we truly care  about, mom-and-pop shops, those small businesses.  Optimism still fueling  these markets.  Look at, the Dow is really starting to take off as the  morning moves on.  104-point gain on the Dow futures.  Again, investors see  this reform, this tax overhaul as fueling growth making this a better place  to do business for everybody.  In Europe, we have losses in France and  Germany and in Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower there.  What can Brown  do for Tesla?  UPS preorders, dozens of the company's upcoming semi-trucks  and another show of confidence for electric automobiles, electric vehicles.   And not the right fit for some investors.  Why Stitch Fix shares are  tumbling after the company's first post IPO earnings port.  </p><p>Plus, spend the holidays with a new best friend, that's my best friend  right there, that's Charlie dog.  I'm taking to him about treats in that  video.  But we will have -- Charlie from animal care center here in New  York City and we're going to see some dogs from ACC coming up in just a  little while.  Our top story this morning, Republicans close to sealing the  deal on tax reform.  One vote away from sending sweeping overhaul to the  President's desk.  Blake Burman at the White House with the very latest.   Hey, Blake.  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Dagen.  Good morning to you.   The ping-ponging of this $1.5 trillion tax bill is set to reach match point  at some point later today.  In the early morning hours at about 12:45 in  the morning earlier today, the Senate strictly partisan lines.  51  Republicans to 48 Democrats passed the tax bill. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCCONNELL:  After eight straight years of slow growth and underperformance  America is ready to take off.  The very, very wealthy.  The highest  spectrum gets almost all the benefits.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now on Tuesday, the House had actually passed the tax bill first  when it got over to the Senate.  Some provisions of it were stripped --  were stripped out due to Senate rules.  So that is why it has to go back to  the House again.  Earlier this morning, the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan  described it as bizarre Senate rules in his words and he says, essentially,  what will happen later this morning is a mere formality.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN:  We didn't think they should have dropped off but they did, it  doesn't really, materially affect the bill very much.  And so we will  revote and pass it out again today.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  And Dagen when that happens later this morning after that it will  all be done.  And then it will be ready, the tax bill for the President to  sign however he will not do this immediately.  The basis for how all of  this work is because this bill is so large, it will likely take several  days for it to be enrolled, get to President over his Christmas break.  So  the options that he would have would be to sign it over Christmas break or  potentially sign it in January when he gets back here to the White House as  one senior White House official put it to me, Dagen, that would allow them  to start the year off with a bang.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And over Christmas like Christmas Eve, Christmas day, the  President wouldn't get that much media coverage I wouldn't think of the  signing and he is a media master, so I don't know if he would sign it on  Christmas.  </p><p>BURMAN:  We love it when the -- when the televisions are on but we also  know on Christmas Eve or Christmas day a lot of them are off.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But, you know -</p><p>BURMAN:  And they know that here -- they know that here too.  So we'll see  how these all shakes out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Blake, Twitter never sleeps.  We know that.</p><p>BURMAN:  If I learned anything, Dagen, these last 11 months, it is that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amen.  Thank you. Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You got it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake Burman at the White House.  There is a lot in this bill  for small businesses.  One of the biggest changes is the way that pass- through -- pass-through entities are taxed.  Pass-through entities now get  a 20 percent deduction that will -- and off of a 30 percent top tax rate,  that will take the top rate on pass-through entities down to 29.6 percent.   And then there are rules that now if you -- these deduction phases out for  married couples at $315,000 for a married couple.  Joining me now to  explain this and the benefits of it is administrator of the small business  administration, Linda McMahon.  Linda, that's what Steve Forbes said this  and I've have been talking about this.  One of the issues, if we have to  find fault with this is that there is some complexity in this soon-to-be  law that applies to these pass-through entities.  How do you get around  that?  </p><p>LINDA MCMAHON, ADMINISTRATOR, SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION: Well, good  morning, Dagen.  Thank so much and, you know, there is no complexity to it  but honestly when our small businesses get through this work through this  and I don't think it's going to be that burdensome for them because they've  been -- they're been accustomed to a little complexity in the past and when  they look at the fact that they're going to get a 20 percent deduction from  their income and they're already now in different tax brackets, they're  going to have about double for their standard deduction.  </p><p>These are real benefits for small businesses and I've traveled the country  over the last several months.  I've been to about 26 states.  I've met with  over 500 small business and talked to them and toured their facilities and  they really were looking so forward to this reduction because they have  told me without fail, they will reinvest any of these savings back into  their businesses.  So they're excited about it and I think if we look at  the enthusiasm that's already in the marketplace, even before the tax bill  was passed and in anticipation of it, we're going to see small businesses  continue to grow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to add to what I was talking about.  So for people married  couples who make $315,000 or more, this deduction is limited and it's  phased out entirely for people in some types of businesses, service as  businesses including medical, legal, consulting and then there were some  criticism of -- in addition regarding real estate investors.  Senator Bob  Corker criticized on that, wait if a test that allows businesses to qualify  for this pass -- for the pass-through based on theirs.  But I want to know,  is this something that you could ultimately fix and broaden this tax break  down the road.  Is that something that is even up for discussion at this  point?  </p><p>MCMAHON:  I have not heard discussion at this point, we've been focused so  much working, you know, with Congress and being out in the marketplace and  really hearing from our small businesses about what they would like to see,  and I think that's really where the focus has been but of course, you know,  we'll continue to be advocates for our almost 30 million small businesses  around the country because they really are -- they are the backbone of our  economy, and the engine of our economy.  So we want to keep them strong and  they are very excited about getting tax deductions.  So, I'm in their  corner all the way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Being the daughter of two individuals who own and ran a small  business my entire life, they feel like they always felt like that  politicians always promised one thing and then delivered another.  But in  fact it seems to be the reverse now at least on some polls, Administrator,  where you guys have stepped up and actually delivered something on cutting  pass-through rates but many Americans don't favor this tax plan.  That you  -- in the Wall Street Journal poll, only 17 percent of people who were  polled think that they're going to get a tax cut when in fact it's 80  percent or more broadly speaking.  Because you've been out there messaging  and talking to these business owners.  Why isn't it connecting more broadly  with American taxpayers and Americans in general?  </p><p>MCMAHON:  Well, I think the proof is going to be in the pudding, Dagen.   We're going to see these benefits, our taxpayers and our small businesses  are going to see more money in their pockets, less money coming out of  their paychecks.  And once this is happening, once the benefits are there,  once our economy is continuing to grow, I think the proof is going to be in  the pudding and I didn't hear any of the small businesses that I talked to  pushing back, saying, boy we're not in favor of tax cuts, we are not in  favor of, you know, paying less to the government.  We like to keep that  money and invest in our business.  I didn't hear that at all.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Administrator, however, the individual cuts expire in 2025, so  do changes for pass-through entities.  That has to be something that  members of your party, the Republicans are talking about trying to extend  at this point because that's going to be -- a lot of the criticism has been  unfair or outright lies from Democrats but that will be something that they  try to hit home and they have been, they keep saying that, oh, half of  Americans are going to have their taxes going up.  Well, that's because  these cuts expire.  So can you fix that in the next few years?  </p><p>MCMAHON:  Well, I think we have seen individual tax cuts extended before,  you know, when they expired and all of this is working and working well, I  don't think anyone is going to vote to let them expire.  And let's look at  it, yes, they do have an expiration date but we're talking almost 10 years.   Let's take the benefit of that today and let's work through -- let's  continue to grow our economy, let's get more towards that four percent that  the President is talking about because I think that really what on the  minds of our small businesses today.  </p><p>They're ready to go, they're ready to start more businesses, they're ready  to invest that income, and they are not really talking about, well, Jeez, I  don't know -- 10 years from now I don't know how that's going to effect.   They want today, they're ready for it.  And they've been promised, the  anticipation level is high and so now it's here and now we're going to see  them -- I think we're going to see them really employ more people and raise  wages and start more business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How fast do you think the economy can grow with this?  You want  to throw out a number?  </p><p>MCMAHON:  I'll leave that up to the President to project that in Congress.   But I think it's going -- I think we're going to see it and the -- I think  we've got the wind in our back and momentum is clearly there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Confidence among independent businesses, national federation of  independent business at an all-time high, a record high in November.   Administrator, thank you.  Linda Mcmahon.</p><p>MCMAHON:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Administrator of a small business administration.  Still ahead,  Varney down the big winners of the tax deal and then for the long haul, UPS  betting big on Tesla and the electric automaker's upcoming semi-truck.   Details on the deal, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tesla getting its largest public preorder for its electric big  rig.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, Dagen.  Well, Tesla unveiled  their big rig the Semis last month, they're going to go into production  2019 and they continue to get orders, the latest one, and its biggest one  ever, now comes from UPS, reserving 125 Tesla Semis.  Both the stocks are  higher today.  And it would be about 200,000 each to a total of about 25  million.  And this comes on the heels of orders from Wal-Mart, also Sysco  Foods, and J.B. Hunt Transportation.  </p><p>How about FedEx?  FedEx is likely to hit a new high at the opening bell  today.  They came out with profits that beat strong global demand.  They  did face a cost from that cyber-attack on their acquisition of TNT Express,  and -- but we know that FedEx and UPS have been all ramping it up for e- commerce.  </p><p>Last but not the least, a quick look at Stitch Fix, this is a fashion  start-up, went public, they were pinched by some costs, and that stock,  Dagen, is down 11-1/2 percent this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Republicans on the verge of a sweeping tax reform victory, the  House set to vote on the final version of the plan this morning, the center  of -- Senate approving the bill late last night.  Joining me now is the  host of \"Varney &amp; Company,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  May I list the winners for you, if I may,  according to moi?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Here we go.  First of all, business, huge winner.  When you drop  the top rate of tax from 35 to 21 percent, you're increasing the  profitability of major American corporations in a very big way.  Second,  the economy, because I think those corporations will use a lot of that  extra money that's coming at them to reinvest, plant an equipment that can  -- not depreciate -- that can expense 100 percent immediately.  I think  this is very good for the economy, it boosts growth with all that extra  money flowing in.  Third, I think it's really good news for low tax states  because A, they're going to get an influx of high-income earners from high- tax states, and B, the removal of the deduction for state and local taxes  means nothing in Texas and Florida because they don't have local taxes to  deduct.  </p><p>I think that's a winner.  I, myself, am a loser in all of this as are many  of my colleagues in New York and New Jersey because we will end up paying  more overall in tax than we do now.  Nonetheless, I support it 100 percent  because I think it brings America back to prosperity.  And we need that  more than anything else.  Prosperity is the glue that binds us together.   We all win from growth.  And that's Elizabeth McDonald making a very early  appearance on the show.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I love it, Stuart, and I agree with you, New York, these  blue states are going to be -- if we're going to have a hard time with it,  but I want -- I want businesses and I want the people like my mom and dad  who worked so hard so many years and never got help from the government, I  want them -- I want them to feel the benefits of this, so I'm  wholeheartedly in agreement with you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Everybody -- you may say that some individuals don't get an  immediate benefit, and that would be true, but, overall, our society gets a  huge benefit from growth and prosperity.  We all win from that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I agree.</p><p>VARNEY:  Just my opinion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts almost exactly 10  minutes from now.  Stuart, I was looking away because we have some special  guests in the studio.  Not Elizabeth McDonald, but -- Stuart Varney at 9:00  a.m., Monday through Friday.  Stuart is unbelievable, incredible man.  </p><p>Still ahead, why was I looking away?  Because Santa Claus is coming to  town.  Santa Claus is in the studio right now.  That's my Charlie dog who  came from New York's ACC.  And we have two dogs who need adopting.  They're  in the studio.  Merry Christmas, guys.  Yes.  Hi, Buddy.  Hi, Maris.  Hi,  Maris.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of the best things you can do is give a pet a home, go out  and rescue a dog particularly this close to the holiday season.  Our next  guests are looking to do that.  The organization is central to New York in  rescuing animals.  Joining me now is Katie Hanson, she's Marketing and  Communications Director with Animal Care Centers of New York City.  She  brought some friends here.  Katie, this is Kelly, and this is Maris.  Maris  is how old?  Seven?</p><p>KATIE HANSON, MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, ANIMAL CARE CENTER:   Seven.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Kelly is two.</p><p>HANSON:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you guys are super special.  And Maris was barking at my  Charlie dog on the T.V.  But people need to understand and we were talking  about this, essentially, ACC is where all of the animals go that are  abandoned.  If a police officer in New York City finds a dog or finds an  animal in need, this is where these animals go.</p><p>HANSON:  Exactly, we're the only -- it's called an open admissions shelter  and we are the only one in New York City that takes in all of the animals,  so we take in about 30 -- between 30,000 and 35,000 animals a year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you've rescue -- your rescue rate or your adoption rate is  sky high.  You've adopted out how many animals so far this year?</p><p>HANSON:  So, so far this year, we've placed 94 percent of the animals that  have come in of the dogs and cats that have come in.  And that is through  direct adoptions, and also, we work with like about 200 rescue partners.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are a lot of other -- my Charlie dog, by the way, you were  seeing a video of him, came from ACC.  He was an owner surrender.  That  literally his owners had him for six years, never took care of him, and he  was sick, and they dumped him with you guys.  And you just see that so  often.  And Charlie was sick which is not that old, but I want to encourage  people also not only do not go out and buy a dog, go rescue, it makes me  crazy.  I had a conversation the other day with somebody about this, that  they were going to go to a pet store and buy a dog, and I said, there's so  many animals in need, particularly, Maris -- hi, buddy.  Maris, how you  doing?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's seven so he's almost -- he's a little bit older,  particularly senior dog and he's barking at the --</p><p>HANSON:  Oh, sees himself.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Maris.  Maris can't be fixed.  So, that's why he's --  because of his age.  So, that's why he's loving on Kelly a little bit.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But really quickly, you also go out and rescue seniors, too?</p><p>HANSON:  Yes, exactly, because they -- and they're actually so much easier  --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come here.</p><p>HANSON:  -- because they're already house-trained that just kind of want to  hang out and give you love and kisses, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, he just gave me a kiss on the leg.  Yes, he did.  And also  you're not -- your -- you started that campaign where you're not  identifying the breeds because these would be referred to as a pit bull  but, again, bad rap.</p><p>HANSON:  Bad rap.  So, they're basically just large free dogs.  And as you  can see, they're totally individual.  Couch potato, a little rambunctious,  so it's really just based on the individuals.  So, they're both large breed  dogs, but they have unique personality.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And check out -- and really --</p><p>HANSON:  They're boroughbred, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come and visit.  Come and visit.</p><p>HANSON:  Yes, come to the shelter.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, Charlie dog is my -- is my life, he is my best friend and  our other dog Ramon, and he came right from ACC.  Ramon and Charlie.</p><p>HANSON:  Thank you so much for having us on.  This is great exposure for  them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.  Thank you, Katie.</p><p>HANSON:  Thank you so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks to Lea, Kevin, and Steve.  And happy anniversary to Lea's  parents, love you all.  That does it for us, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" is right  now.  Stuart?</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I  can't believe it.  Thank you, ladies.  Good to see you, guys.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday,  December 20th.  Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Senate making history.  Republicans approving the largest overhaul of  our country's tax system in about 30 years, early this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY:  I'm a little surprised the democrats  all decided voting against middle class tax relief and make American  business more competitive as a smart vote and that's an argument we're more  than happy to have.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  Eighty-three percent of the middle class  will get -- will either pay more in taxes or get little breadcrumbs.  Is  that this great bill that's helping the middle class?  Absolutely not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The house will vote on the bill later today, likely sending it  to the President Trump's desk to sign.</p><p>The house originally did pass it yesterday, but there was a procedural snag  that is forced the second vote.  It was a snag over in the senate.   Following the passage in the senate, futures are showing this happening in  the markets.  We had a slight full back in the Dow yesterday, off about 37  points.  But we're seeing possibly new all-time highs for all your major  market gauges.</p><p>By the way, you have highs on the transports earlier in the week on the  Russell 2000.  Literally every single market gauge in the U.S. has been  moving in sync on the optimism from this tax reform package.</p><p>Over in Europe, checking on England, France and Germany, we have losses  across the board.  All those slight, all markets there down, lessen, about  two tenths of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight stocks mostly lower as well.  The Nikkei in Japan up ever  so slightly.</p><p>ISIS threatening America.  The terror group warning of the New Year's Eve  attack. The latest as New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo announces heightened  security measures for the holidays.</p><p>Uber, dealt a blow in Europe.  The EU's top core has ruled that the  ridesharing company is a taxi service and should be regulated as such.  We  break down the major implications of that ruling.</p><p>What can brown do for Tesla?  The details as UPS delivers a big bet on the  company's electric semi-truck.</p><p>And Diddy making moves to be the top cat down in Carolina.  The music mogul  reportedly meeting with ambassadors in his bid to buy the Panthers.  How  the teams could soon have a new owner.  All of that and so much more coming  up this morning.</p><p>Fox News correspondent, Lea Gabrielle, Benchmark managing partner, Kevin  Kelly and Forbes Media chairman, former republican presidential candidate,  Steve Forbes.</p><p>When you walked in this morning, I went I am so glad you're here.  Any day,  but particularly this day, Mr. Forbes.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because we have the same feeling about this tax cut package.   But if you listen to the democrats, we're going to hell.  That's pretty  much the message.  The country is going hell.  It's savory and I just say,  poppycock to that.  So we're going to get into that immediately.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it's a good word to use on a family channel.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I have an entire lexicon of things like that, like gooey  and poppycock, and balderdash.  So I will break all of that out.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  I think I heard you called the democrats  when it's coming into this plain nincompoops.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  You know what?  I actually called the  republicans nincompoops.</p><p>KELLY:  That's what it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As thy are putting this together, this is -- </p><p>FORBES:  Another old word is knuckleheads.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Knuckleheads.  This is what we're going to talk about though,  that why do people not yet feel good about this tax reform?  Part of it is  the problem of how they put it together.  So we're going to talk about that  in two seconds.  I just want to tease our guests that are coming up,  Illinois congressman, Peter Roskam.  Fox News senior judicial analyst,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Louisiana senator, John Kennedy.  Former  republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  And administrator of the  small business administration, Linda McMahaon.  There's a lot in this  package for small businesses as well.</p><p>But first, on the verge of a big tax victory.  Republicans are set to give  their final approval to a sweeping tax overhaul today after the senate  passed a plan and a late night vote.</p><p>House are scheduled a final vote this morning on the plan ready to send it  to President Trump's desk to sign it into law.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell says that both American businesses  and individual tax payers will see the benefit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCONNELL:  We had three, two quarters in a row of three percent growth.   Stock market is up.  Optimism is high.  Coupled with this tax reform,  America is ready to start performing as they should have for a number of  years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The president congratulating lawmakers on Twitter, writing \"The  United States senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut in reform  barrel.  Terrible individual mandate, Obamacare repealed.  Goes to the  house tomorrow morning for a final vote.  If approved, there will be a news  conference at the White House at approximately 1:00 p.m.</p><p>Steve Forbes, we're on the precipice of passing this first major tax  overhaul.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" is saying certainly on the business  side, it actually does more in some ways than the '86 tax reform did in  terms of reforming corporate taxes.</p><p>FORBES:  The big news on the business side reducing the rate, corporate  rate down to 21 and pastors and its partnerships, Ascopr in the like which  how most American businesses organize for tax purposes.  They got that rate  down.  Looks like 29.6.  We'll have to see the final details on that.</p><p>Overseas earnings, no longer being penalized and bringing some of that cash  back home.  Instant expensing.  So if there are no sleepers in this bill,  and the market, I think would have fare the amount by now.  They did good  on that side.  The individual side is where they've got to do work the next  time.</p><p>And I hope today -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  When is the next time?  When is that?</p><p>FORBES:  Well, this is what they should announce today.  That oh, yes, it's  great history, since 1986 and all that good stuff.  What they should also  announce is this is a down payment.  This is the first of many big tax cuts  to come.  Give people anticipation, especially on the individual side.   We're going to keep slashing taxes because you the Americans create the  resources and can employ them better than Washington bureaucrats.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think the question though for many of us, is that really  possible if you look at the debt worth, 20 trillion in debt and people can  show that a national security issue.  So, can you -- is it really feasible  -- </p><p>FORBES:  What history shows -- experience shows is the only way you get a  balanced budget, if you want that is what the booming economy.  Late 1960s.   Kennedy tax cuts, finally in the 90s, after the Cold War and Reagan's Cold  War victory massive tax cuts.  So if you want to get the Russian's fiscal  situation under control, that economy where people feel good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  On that note, Steve, the budget deficit has grown in the last  two years.  Spending has gone up, but not that much, it's because revenues  haven't been growing in the most recent fiscal year revenue grew at one  percent and in an expansion, it should be growing at three to five percent,  but this recovery, this growth period in American history has been so weak  because of regulations and because of flawed tax code quite frankly.</p><p>FORBES:  The last decade was at the worst economic growth since the 1930s.   And so that's why I think even deregulation sounds boring, but regulations  are attacks and the fact they are moving regulations, Washington isn't  getting up each morning figuring out how to make life more miserable for  business, has already had an impact.</p><p>And you're going to see now that this thing is going to be actually in  reality.  You're going to see much more investment.  And what democrats  refuse to recognize is, if you want a higher standard of living, you have  to have people making investments, creating those new products and  services, there's better paying jobs.</p><p>And one of the things they should emphasize is not just going to keep more  what you now earn, but your earnings, your pay is going to up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  Thank you.  To all of these democrats, not one  democrat voter for this plan.  And I tweeted this out earlier.  \"More than  80 percent of people, of taxpayers in this country, at least in the first  year are going to get a tax cut.  They're going to see more money in their  paycheck.</p><p>They're going to get to keep more of the money that they earned.  So try  running on that, because the democrats think that the messaging is that  again, the country that we -- this is a scam, whatever language that you  want to pit.</p><p>But again, try running on giving people more of their money.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, the problem is that democrats don't have any right to critic  this plan because none of them voted for it.  We're limited to $155  trillion.  We've seen under the previous administration that they didn't  even want to tackle deficits.  So we're in this vicious circle where all of  a sudden now the democrats have found religion when it comes to deficits.</p><p>But at the detriment of the American people that actually need strong  growth, they've been under the thumb of rules and regulations including the  Obamacare, as President Trump has alluded to.</p><p>But I think the important thing to take away from this is that it's cheaper  is for companies to invest here in the United States than it is abroad,  right?</p><p>But there was a detriment for them to invest here, when you can have four  corporations coming in and compete at a lower tax rate.  Look over at the  U.K., right?  Twenty percent corporate tax rate that are going to take to  17.5 percent.</p><p>We are nowhere near competitive.  We have one of the highest corporate tax  rates in the world.  So, how do you get companies to invest here?  You  unleash prosperity through property plan, equipment when they can reinvest  in a 21 percent rate.</p><p>FORBES:  One of the things that republicans should learn from this is get  rid of this constraint, from this congressional budget office, these fakes,  projections out 10 years that assume the tax cuts don't do much for the  economy, get rid of that.  Assume 3.5 percent growth and by golly have  greater muscular tax cuts.  One must be a tax cut in the future.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I need to get this.  This is what I want to you -- I want to get  your answer on this and it goes to the way that the democrats have been  messaging this.  While markets are optimistic about this tax plan, business  owners and operators are optimistic.  It remains unpopular with the  American people.  Actually, it's become more unpopular.</p><p>This is a new \"Wall Street Journal-NBC News\" poll that found 41 percent of  Americans say that the tax plan is a bad idea.  Just 24 percent of it say  it's a good idea.  Top republicans insist the numbers will shift in the  coming months.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCONNELL:  My view of this, if we can't sell this to the American people,  we ought to go into another line of work.  I think this is an important  accomplishment for the country, that people will value and appreciate, but  obviously it requires us to continue this discussion.</p><p>REP.  PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  People are out there  on TV telling mistruth, disguising the facts of this thing.  That's going  to make it unpopular.  When we get this done, when people see the  withholding improving, when they see the jobs occurring, when they see  bigger paychecks, a fairer tax system, a simpler tax code, that's what's  going to produce the results.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Richard Rubin is the reporter at \"The Wall Street Journal\" and  he points out and I did as well on Twitter, 80 percent in the first year,  80 percent of households get a tax cut.  At least, if not more than that.   But 17 percent of people think they're getting tax cuts.  That is  unbelievable.</p><p>Bit to the democrats who are saying it's a scam.  Tom Perez, the head of  the DNC said in his statement taxes are going up.  Yet, taxes are going up  for people when these tax cuts expire, eight or ten years from now.  That's  a lie.</p><p>The American people are being told lies by the democrats.  But I say to  them, I say to these liberals who are messaging this, you know what?   People are going to get more money back.  They're going to see money in  their paychecks.  So good luck with that.</p><p>FORBES:  You see, one of the problems with the mainstream media is located  they're located in New York and California.  Many of them won't see a tax  cut because the loss of state and local deductions.</p><p>So in their little world this thing doesn't look so good.  They forget the  rest of the country.  And one of the things republicans have got to do is  more messaging.  Not just say the results and speak for themselves, but  explain to people why this is better and also start talking about payroll  reform.</p><p>Six years ago, they allowed for a couple of years people to keep their  first two points on the social security tax, even if you didn't pay income  tax, which many Americans don't.  You got a higher paycheck, so they should  put that on the table, say, if we get reelected, everyone in the work is  going to get another tax cut.  Start throwing out things for the future.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're not going to argue about that because the payroll tax --  well, the payroll tax goes to fund the benefit.  It goes to fund social  security and Medicare.</p><p>FORBES:  But the fact of the matter is they use the general budget when  they need it.  And they've used this for political purposes to make sure  everyone feels it for a couple of years and you do more muscular tax cuts.   So it's part of a plan -- set of this kiddy credit, which is a giveaway for  people </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have to go.  But I want to point something out.  When in this  country did we start believing that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and  democrats make better decisions with our money?  This is my money.  I think  I make better decisions about my life, my health and my money than those  elected officials who have their heels dug in down in D.C.</p><p>FORBES:  Even a buffets of democrats, I'll trust him more than Nancy  Pelosi.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a big blow for Uber in Europe.  A new ruling says that the  company should be regulated like taxis.  What it means for drivers and  users of the popular ridesharing app?</p><p>Plus, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, reportedly taking another step in its effort to  buy the Carolina Panthers.  New details on how Colin Kaepernick might be  involved.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This breaking news overnight.  The E.U. dealing a major setback  to Uber.  Lauren Simonetti has the details.  Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Dagen, the European court of  justice ruling that Uber should be regulated as a taxi company and not as a  digital service.  Uber has been trying to use courts to reduce their  regulatory oversight.  Uber claims that I's an app, so it could connect  drivers with passengers that they pick up.</p><p>Uber adds that the ruling should not have an immediate impact on how it  operates in Europe.  Shares -- well, it's not a publicly traded company.   Or at least not yet.</p><p>UPS ordering 125 of Tesla's all-electric semi-trucks.  This is the largest  public order for the big, thus far.  The Tesla trucks will cost about  $200,000 each.  Tesla expects them to be in production by 2019.</p><p>This is where I'm going to show you shares of Tesla.

He and Diddy,  according to the report had a conversation and they discussed the former  NFL quarterback's role in any potential deal.  Panthers' owner Jerry  Richardson announced that he would be putting the franchise up for sale  amid sexual and racial misconduct allegations.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you think?</p><p>KELLY:  I mean, I think it's pretty interesting.  Well, getting back to the  Uber situation that most of the rules and regulations that come on this  technology companies, whether it's Google or Uber or any other is coming  from Europe.  And I think that's going to be a big thing going into next  year.</p><p>I think there's going to be a lot of rules and regulations coming,  especially to Facebook.  So, I think that's pretty telling.  We're starting  to see the ripples now.  We'll feel the effects next year.</p><p>FORBES:  And also shows why Britain pulled out of the E.U. is that they're  very anti-growth, anti-innovation.  Always has this guild medieval  mentality of something new comes along, we have much pressure and control  it</p><p>And you're right though.  In this country, the big tech companies don't  realize they're going into a political buzz saw because of their alleged  power and they haven't done -- in the old days, back before any of you were  born, the old AT&amp;T monopoly survived as long as it did, because it made  sure everyone was serviced, everyone -- every politician got free phone,  not free phone service during the campaign.  But they got the phone  service, every newspaper and the net.  They covered all their bases.</p><p>These tech companies, especially Google discriminating against  conservatives on what they're allowed to post.  That stuff is going to get  a political backlash.  I wish they'd wake up to this.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that they are waking up. I think that they are waking  up, that they realized the power of Washington and what they -- what might  be brought to bear on them.</p><p>FORBES:  They're still playing with the conservatives.</p><p>KELLY:  They're the biggest donors to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, and  so they're actually enabling this.  And so they're kind of blinded by kind  of their friends in Washington that aren't really going to be there to help  them out.</p><p>FORBES:  They have to realize there are two parties in this country.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll see the reaction of this tax reform because it's going to  feel good to a lot of them.</p><p>Coming up, ISIS, threatening attacks here and in Europe over the holiday  season.  The latest target, New Year's Eve.  How officials here in New York  City are stepping up security a week after that subway bomb blast.</p><p>And the divide in the fight against opioid abuse.  The overdose antidote  helping victims, but it may also put law enforcement at risk.  The  controversy, ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A new terror warning.  ISIS releasing several disturbing  propaganda posters threatening attacks over the holiday season.  The latest  target?  New Year's Eve.  This comes a week and a half after an attempted  suicide bombing in New York City.</p><p>New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo has announced tightened security measures  over the holidays including increased personnel, bomb sniffing dogs and  even radiation detectors.</p><p>Joining us this morning is national security analyst at the Clarion  Project, professor of counterterrorism at Liberty University down at  Lynchburg, Virginia, Ryan Mauro.</p><p>Ryan, what do you make of this?</p><p>RYAN MAURO, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, CLARION PROJECT:  Well, of course  ISIS is going to be saying something like this.  For me, what the message  should be is even if they were to succeed in carrying out an attack, the  so-called lonewolf for those doesn't actually exist.  One guy goes off and  he kill some people.</p><p>Overall, they're still a bunch of losers.  Ninety-six percent of their  caliphate has been destroyed.  We need to start weaponizing Trump's  trolling.  Make fun of them for how many dumb things that they do and for a  group that claims that Allah is blessing them and on their side, well,  actually it kind of looks like if they all exist, he's on our side because  we're really killing them.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, Ryan, I think you make such a good point because ISIS  has lost ground in the Middle East, essentially what it's trying to  establish is a cyber-caliphate and so it's trying to influence people.   People who are crazy.</p><p>A lot of these people who are lonewolf attackers don't really have a real  attachment to terrorist groups overseas, as you know.  And instead what  they're trying to do is reach people who are angry, people who want to take  that anger and hate out on people and then essentially get to them through  the internet.</p><p>But when you look at terror attacks in places like New York City, these  lonewolf attacks, what's so difficult is trying to identify them ahead of  time.  So you have some 3,000 police officers patrolling down the subway  systems for example in New York each day.</p><p>What they're really having to be able to do is assess people.  So how can  people better be able to asses people or officers and just people on the  streets to see if maybe they're -- to have those assessments in mind in  case they see some something and then they should say something.</p><p>MAURO:  Sure.  Great question.  The average civilian is just looking at  something like a backpack that's place somewhere.  That's kind of obvious  thing that made you uncomfortable reporting that type of thing.  For law  enforcement, I do a lot of training of law enforcement and what I'll teach  them is look for these dramatic overhauls in someone's personality because  that's what the radicalization process looks like.  Obsession.  He becomes  obsessed with the ideology.</p><p>They usually start alienating their friends and family because they become  real judgmental.  But I would say that when you look into the backgrounds  of these folks, yes, they may not initially have connections to a terrorist  group, per say, but they will have connections to a supposedly nonviolent  extremist movement.</p><p>You look far back into where these initial ideas kind of incubate and  you'll see connections to groups around the world that are considered  moderate by comparison, but still radical in repulsive and that's where I  think our attention should and that's why I think that congress really need  to investigate how the Obama administration impeded counterterrorism  investigations and prosecutions because that's the foundation where this  begins.</p><p>It's not about political points.  It's about figuring out where these  mistakes were made and going back and fixing them.</p><p>FORBED:  One of the things that happen a few years ago is the New York  police department had a good intelligence operation and then politically  they forward it.  Is that back up to full speed again?</p><p>MAURO:  Not really.  Because what happens is when something like that  occurs, you influence the culture.  And so you can still have  investigations on the street level, but those specific programs that were  shut down, even if you were to revive them -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Muslim communities and mosques just trying to figure out if  there is a would-be terrorist where the individual was working, where the  individual might be living and basically in secret.  But do you think --  New Yorkers are angry.</p><p>New Yorkers are angry that in 14 months, we've had three terror attacks.   Eight people killed over near the Westside highway on a bike path and then  after the fact, they put up concrete barricades, some of which are  decorated for Christmas.  People are irritated, they're angry, they're --  you know what and what is New York going to do about it?</p><p>MAURO:  Well, there a few different programs that were conflated.  The  biggest amount of lying that went on in the media and also pushed by  certain activist organizations was this idea that the NYPD was just spying  on Muslims for simply Muslim.</p><p>If you look at the stuff that real resources were put into, there are  always indications of extremism such as classes on how to disarm police.   If you get into a fight with cops.  That's a sign of extremism.  Start  there.</p><p>Believe it or not, those type of indicators are all over the place and  that's where you start.  And if you look at this as an ideological  insurgency, not a criminal intelligence problem, not even terrorism  problem, but an ideological insurgency and you say what is the  infrastructure for this problem.  Start there.  You'll find the bad guys.   It just requires some political incorrectness.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ryan, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  Ryan Mauro.  Again,  be vigilant.  Be vigilant.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook expanding the use of its facial recognition, but it's  raising new concerns over privacy.</p><p>And do you have one of the most popular computer passwords of the year?   We'll tell you why that's not a good thing.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, December 20th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Clearing  the final hurdles to tax reform, the Senate burning the midnight oil to  pass the largest tax code overhaul in three decades, the votes split  straight down party line, not one single Democrat defecting in support of  this bill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE:  I think every  Democrat who votes against this and apparently, that's all of them in the  House and Senate, are saying, in effect, we are satisfied of where we are.   They're simply not interested in doing the kind of things that economists  believe will get the country growing again.</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER (D), MARYLAND:  There was no inclusion of Democrats in  this process.  When the senator says, you know, we want to give tax cut,  frankly, we want to give tax cut as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The House will vote on the updated bill today, likely sending it  to the President's desk.  Optimism over tax reform still fuelling these  markets, futures are showing gains across the board, 75 point gain on the  Dow futures right now.  It has been an incredible year for stocks.  Dow was  down about 37 points yesterday, but we are seeing the optimism return.</p><p>In Europe, we have losses across the board in England, France, and Germany,  and seems like the sung is picking up a little bit of steam in France and  Germany right now.  In Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower as well, the  slight gain for the Nikkei in Japan.  </p><p>Tragedy in Mexico, a tour bus carrying American cruise ship passengers  crashes, killing at least 12 people.  We have the latest from that  investigation ahead.  The opioid epidemic striking the workplace, alcohol  and drug-related overdoses at work, spike to new levels, how the government  is working to combat that growing health crisis.</p><p>And putting the face in Facebook, the social media site sparking privacy  concern with new facial recognition technology, why the company says it  added the feature, ahead.  And these aren't the passwords you're looking  for, Star Wars make its debut on the annual list of the worst passwords, we  will let you know what took the top spot this year.</p><p>But to our top story this half hour, the opioid epidemic hitting the  workplace, according to a new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  unintentional drug and alcohol overdose deaths at work spiked 32 percent in  2016.  The number tripling since the bureau began compiling data back in  2011.  Joining us this morning is Opiant Pharmaceuticals CEO, Doctor Roger  Crystal, Doctor, your company develops the easy-to-use overdose antidote,  NARCAN, which is a nasal spray, so you're at the forefront of combating  this opioid epidemic.  What do you think of these new statistics?</p><p>DR. ROGER CRYSTAL, CEO OF OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS:  For me, given my  background, this really isn't a surprise, actually, unfortunately.  The  opioid crisis has just continued to grow.  I'm from the U.K., originally,  and trained as a surgeon and there are those types of numbers that don't  yet exist, but part of that, kind of, the big driver of that has been,  unfortunately, in the past.  The over-prescribing of opioid painkillers,  and that's something that we need to address as a country alongside  treating all of these people who are unfortunately addicted to opioids and  alcohol.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Aren't we already doing that in terms of really reining in the  amount of opioids prescribed.  I mean, I personally experienced it with all  my doctors, you have -- you have dental surgery, they do not give you  Vicodin any longer.  In terms of it, even at the state level, it's -- you  have -- it is very, very hard to get a prescription for anything as  powerful as, like, Oxycodone or Oxycontin at this point.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  That's true that there are some measures in place already, so I  hope we do -- we will see a reduction.  I will say that even recently as  last year, there were still over 200 million opioid prescriptions made out  to approximately 20 million people.  So this is a huge issue and that  doesn't also address the two and a half million opioid addicts who we have  in this country already.  So we are really not there yet, I'm afraid. . KELLY:  Yes, so getting back to your product and what you guys do, you guys  have a nasal spray that people that are currently addicted to heroin take  or can you explain to us the product and you've got FDA approval and, kind  of, walk us through what you guys are doing.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  So, the product is called the NARCAN Nasal Spray and this saves  lives if someone with overdose from an opioid.  And when we say opioid,  yes, correct, it is something like heroin or Fentanyl, unfortunately, we  see there now, but also, just routine normal painkillers such as Oxycontin  and Vicodin and was -- I agree that they are being prescribed less.  </p><p>They are still overprescribed, and it's not for someone who's even  necessarily an addict.  I'm in good health, I don't abuse opioids, if my  dentist were to prescribe me Oxycontin, I will still be at risk of an  opioid overdose (INAUDIBLE) prudent for me to be prescribed the NARCAN  Nasal Spray alongside any opioid as a -- as a just in case measure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to get to why you're talking about NARCAN.  There  was a report recently that police departments are split over the use of  NARCAN, that some police officials are talking about like a resources for  obtaining, maintaining and tracking supplies, and for training in and when  how to use it, are you seeing any pushback from police departments when  they encounter rescue squads, ambulance services, paramedics, when they  encounter people who have overdosed for them using NARCAN?</p><p>CRYSTAL:  The feedback from ourselves and from our partners adapt farmers  as well.  There's no real pushback in terms of not wanting to recede the  NARCAN Nasal Spray.  It's easy to use, it saves lives, it's been FDA  approved.  So there's a real gratitude when they finally can get hold of it  because actually, it's something that people are then able to use and save  lives, the challenge about resources that is more -- a broader issue about  funding.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's true for some, but I know that Sheriff Jones in Butler  County Ohio, does not want his officers carrying this and it's because for  one thing. They say that, you know, law enforcement officials are supposed  to be able to enforce the law, not end up, basically, treating people who  are going to overdose again and again, and they see these repeat offenders.  </p><p>You know, they also say that sometimes, people come to and they actually  assault the person who was trying to help them.  There was an incident  about in Middle town where an injured firefighter was injured.  And so you  look at this, and you go, a firefighter is supposed to be fighting fires,  yet, they do, you know, give emergency medical help as well.  But gosh,  like, should they be carrying this around and then being put in this  position where they are -- they are expanding their duties to something  that they really are not supposed to be doing?</p><p>CRYSTAL:  Well, that represents this issue, a vast minority of people and  certainly, the (INAUDIBLE) you mentioned is very outspoken and that's  particularly rare.  The emergency responders in general, that is their  chance (INAUDIBLE) overall is to respond to an emergency, why, to  ultimately save lives and this is -- this is a very successful way of  saving a life if given appropriately.  And people if they get the right  training, should absolutely be well-handled to do so. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your company got some good news about feasibility of a heroin  vaccine that's getting worse.  Tell us about that.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  So this is an early stage program that we are very fortunate to  have partnered with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and neither  the National Institute of Drug Abuse, so we have this program and we got  some recent news that's going to be published around the feasibility of  this heroin vaccine.  It's showing that not only does the vaccine seem to  work in an animal model against heroin, but also, activity with some of  these opioid painkillers as well.  </p><p>We are encouraged by that.  We also have the data to show that this can  potentially be scaled up and therefore, truly manufactured on the  commercial level once it gets into the clinics, so this is very important  even at this stage, when we are thinking about this as a proper product to  get out there.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA:  Can we get a  balance in pain management as, you know, 15 years ago, the rap against  medical profession was they weren't doing enough people in pain which led  to for whatever reason we have the crisis today.  What is the balance?</p><p>CRYSTAL:  The balance is a tough one to strike.  And I talked about my  experience in the U.K. as a surgeon there.  And by no means is the U.K.  perfect at all.  We probably didn't prescribe sufficient analgesia.  The  balance, really, to think about how we address that is starting off with  medical schools, and I say, medical, not just the M.D. medical, but dental  schools and anyone else who's interfacing with patients who are in pain.   Pain just doesn't need to be addressed with painkillers.  </p><p>I think that's the first thing that's really important to think about here.   Often physical therapy can be extremely helpful and in fact, patients need  to understand that some pain isn't, in fact, a bad thing, if they are  reassured, psychologically, that this is part of healing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the backlash has been toward, and I speak from personal  experience, family experience, that people who are in critical pain, who  need opioids, who need Oxycontin, who need Oxycodone, who are fighting  stage 4 bone cancer.  It is incredibly difficult now to get prescription  refilled, that you have to have, and the supplies -- they give you a very  short supply.  </p><p>But these are people who literally can't get addicted because of the pain  levels they're experiencing.  These are deadly diseases and they're just  trying to manage their pain, but it's incredibly difficult.  Now, for these  people to even -- to go -- you have to drive -- my mother has to drive two  hours to get a paper prescription from her doctor every couple of weeks,  literally.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  No, absolutely.  And that's very unfortunate and the fact that  people who generally do require opioids, potentially are finding harder to  get access.  I absolutely sympathize tremendously in that situation.  The  issue we have is the vast majority of people probably not to be on opioids  in the first place.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  I mean, that's what's so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, there it lies the personal responsibility, I have  conversations with friends and family all of the time, that if a doctor  ever offers to give you an opioid, you say no, I just had tooth pulled, I  don't need Vicodin for that.  And people are hesitant now, I think, at  least through the communication through the media, people are hesitant to  take opioids at all because they know they're so highly addictive, I mean,  it doesn't take much for some people to become chronically addicted to the  point that they can't stop taking it.</p><p>CRYSTAL:  Absolutely.  And the issue that we have here is that not everyone  is so willing to challenge (INAUDIBLE) and actually, it's a multifaceted  approach.  So, it's the historical marketing of drugs, it's the fact that  doctors have been overprescribing, it's the fact that patients aren't as  empowered as perhaps they have been, so it's very difficult to say there's  one specific area of responsibility but recognizing we have this crisis.  </p><p>We need to do something about it.  Part of it is to stop the  overprescribing and misprescribing of opioids and for where we play a role  as a company, is to treat addictions themselves.  Anyone who is an opioid  addict, the sooner you can get on definitive medical care and the longer  you can receive medical treatment, the far greater the likelihood of not  relapsing and actually going into long-term recovery and that's what we are  committed to.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Doctor Crystal, it's good to see you.  Doctor Roger Crystal,  thank you so much for being here.  Coming up, Delta says, pay up, the  airline calling on officials at Atlanta's Airport for compensation after  the massive power outage caused Delta to lose millions of dollars in  revenue because thousands of flights have to be canceled.  And (INAUDIBLE)  shares of the popular online retailer, Stitch Fix, tumbling after its first  earnings report as a public company, the details are next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, futures reporting to a higher open, 78-point gain  on the Dow Futures right now.  </p><p>We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  Stitch Fix shares unraveling in  pre-market following its first earnings report since its IPO.  The  personalized apparel company reporting strong customer gains, but it only  narrowly beat profit expectations because of expansion costs.  The company  is also struggled to convince investors it can keep up the growth.  Shares  are down 12 percent in premarket trading.  </p><p>And can the Blackberry turn around continue?  The former smartphone giant  is set to report its third-quarter earnings before the bell today.   Analysts are expecting revenue of about $215 million.  The company has  recently pivoted away from phones to cybersecurity software.  Blackberry  shares are up nearly 60 percent so far, this year.  </p><p>12 people are dead after a tour bus crashes in Mexico, Lauren Simonetti has  details, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Such a terrible story, Dagen.  The bus was carrying cruise ship  passengers on an (INAUDIBLE) in Mexico when it flipped over on a narrow  highway yesterday, killing 12 people; 20 others injured, including seven  Americans.  Royal Caribbean says passengers from two of its ships were on  that bus.  Investigators now are working to go figure out what caused the  crash.  </p><p>Well, Delta wants some money back.  The airline is seeking to be repaid for  lost revenue after Sunday's power outage at Hartsfield-Jackson  International Airport in Atlanta.  Delta CEO Bastian says, the airline may  have lost between 25 and $50 million of revenue as a result, and he plans  to talk to both the airport as well as Georgia Power.  That outage caused  Delta to cancel about 1400 flights, and they also had to put stranded  passengers up in hotel rooms.  Hartsfield-Jackson is Delta's main hub.   Taking a look at shares of the company, this year up about 13 percent.  </p><p>And can you believe that in 2017 people are still using password as their  password?  Here is a list of this year's most common password.  We'll start  with number three: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, really, I swear.  And second place  is: password, for the fourth year in a row.  The most common password of  the year: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  I don't even know how this is possible.   Because many Web sites, at least the one I use, make you change your  password, and then you have to have the capital letter, the number, the  symbol that you can't remember it, so you're constantly changing it.   Anyway, for those of you who still use \"password\", we have new passwords  that you might want to change to.  None of these are good, but they are  popular: \"let me in\", \"monkey\", and \"Star Wars\", made to the list of the  most common new password.  Dagen, what are your passwords?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, I can't even remember them.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I only know them on the QWERTY keyboard by the keystrokes.  But  it's never -- you're not supposed to actually use a word ever, no word in  the dictionary, there should never be a word in your password.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Impossible to remember.</p><p>KELLY:  Can I just say that hope that one of the brain trusts of the  Democratic Party John Podesta watch this segment, the password for his e- mail which WikiLeaks got was \"p@ssword\" and the \"a\" was the \"@\" symbol.   So, hopefully, he watches this -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I thought that was pretty classy.</p><p>KELLY:  He knows not -- hopefully he didn't change it to \"Let me In\", or  \"Monkey,\" or \"Star Wars.\" </p><p>FORBES:  I hope the used the password for Democrats, tax cuts.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And needed little @.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you put in #tax, if you're going to tweet, the first thing  that comes up tax cut scam.  And it just makes me so angry because it's not  a -- the Democrats weren't involved in it, that doesn't mean it's a scam.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>FORBES:  No.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  But that's good marketing.  </p><p>KELLY:  No, it's a scam when you get to keep more of your own money.  It's  ridiculous.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But all hat -- all hat no cattle, is what that is.  Good  marketing, yes.  Good words, no action.  Coming up, control or creepy?   Facebook's expanded facial recognition, which will alert you if your  picture is posted through the social media site even if you're not tagged  in it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook raising new privacy concerns.  The company expanding  its facial recognition technology, it will now alert you if your photo is  posted to the social media site even if you're not tagged in it.  But  Facebook has a different spin, Gerry Willis is here with the details.  I  don't think it sounds like the worst idea, actually.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FBN HOST:  It doesn't, and they're not saying that at all,  that we're going to hurt your privacy.  In fact, they're saying 180-degree  the opposite.  Here's what they say, if someone uploads a photo of your  face to Facebook, the company usually knows that it's you, thanks to facial  recognition technology.  Facebook will now alert people that a friend or a  friend of a friend, whoever uploaded a photo of them, even they haven't  been tagged in the picture.  </p><p>This is what Facebook says, \"We're doing this to prevent from people from  impersonating others on Facebook.\"  Facebook says it has no plans to use  facial recognition to enhance ads targeting.  That's the first thing I  thought of, that this has something to do with advertising.  Like, sharing  you more news feed post from friends who post and tag photos of you, or as  related to locations where you appear in untagged photos.  </p><p>For example, if you're in somebody's profile photo, which is always public,  you'll always be notified.  For other photos, though, you'll only get  notified if you're in the audience for that photo so as to protect the  uploader's privacy, and not alert you about photos you're not allowed to  see.  Facebook says, the feature is designed to give people more control  and make them feel safer because that's the ultimate goal in this society  that they're, at least, that everybody feels safe.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, impersonation is a huge problem on Facebook.  And I had --  somebody came -- was on air with us years ago and literally took, I'm not  joking, more than 30 photos in the building of themselves, and they tagged  me in every single photo and I wasn't in one of them.  And it was like the  most bizarre thing.  And so, why would you do that?  This is way -- this is  another step in preventing some kind of nonsense like that.  </p><p>WILLIS:  If you're not convinced to this?  You can have it undone of your  Facebook.  There's a way to delete it so that you don't have to be part of  this if you don't want to.  But I see what you're saying and makes a lot of  sense for people who are worried about impersonation.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  In fact, delete it from people who are trying to impersonate  people.  In others words --</p><p>WILLIS:  It will just alert.

So, for somebody who wants  to try to impersonate somebody else -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Go find those people.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  They can figure it out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will know that something is not right if something's up if  you start like, if I have a pimple on my face and I start getting ads --  no, I start getting ads for Clear Fill.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a proactive face watch.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Dagen, never gets a pimple. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, that's not true.</p><p>KELLY:  I think this highlight, though, the omnipotent power of Facebook,  whether you recognize it or not.  Because they know you're in the photo.   So, you know, whether you're tagged it's you -- they know who are, and  that's how they track.</p><p>WILLIS:  I gave up with privacy a long time ago.</p><p>KELLY:  You are the product.

I  can't believe it.  Thank you, ladies.  Good to see you, guys.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday,  December 20th.  Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Senate making history.  Republicans approving the largest overhaul of  our country's tax system in about 30 years, early this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY:  I'm a little surprised the democrats  all decided voting against middle class tax relief and make American  business more competitive as a smart vote and that's an argument we're more  than happy to have.</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  Eighty-three percent of the middle class  will get -- will either pay more in taxes or get little breadcrumbs.  Is  that this great bill that's helping the middle class?  Absolutely not.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The house will vote on the bill later today, likely sending it  to the President Trump's desk to sign.</p><p> The house originally did pass it yesterday, but there was a procedural snag  that is forced the second vote.  It was a snag over in the senate.   Following the passage in the senate, futures are showing this happening in  the markets.  We had a slight full back in the Dow yesterday, off about 37  points.  But we're seeing possibly new all-time highs for all your major  market gauges.</p><p> By the way, you have highs on the transports earlier in the week on the  Russell 2000.  Literally every single market gauge in the U.S. has been  moving in sync on the optimism from this tax reform package.</p><p> Over in Europe, checking on England, France and Germany, we have losses  across the board.  All those slight, all markets there down, lessen, about  two tenths of a percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight stocks mostly lower as well.  The Nikkei in Japan up ever  so slightly.</p><p> ISIS threatening America.  The terror group warning of the New Year's Eve  attack. The latest as New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo announces heightened  security measures for the holidays.</p><p> Uber, dealt a blow in Europe.  The EU's top core has ruled that the  ridesharing company is a taxi service and should be regulated as such.  We  break down the major implications of that ruling.</p><p> What can brown do for Tesla?  The details as UPS delivers a big bet on the  company's electric semi-truck.</p><p> And Diddy making moves to be the top cat down in Carolina.  The music mogul  reportedly meeting with ambassadors in his bid to buy the Panthers.  How  the teams could soon have a new owner.  All of that and so much more coming  up this morning.</p><p> Fox News correspondent, Lea Gabrielle, Benchmark managing partner, Kevin  Kelly and Forbes Media chairman, former republican presidential candidate,  Steve Forbes.</p><p> When you walked in this morning, I went I am so glad you're here.  Any day,  but particularly this day, Mr. Forbes.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because we have the same feeling about this tax cut package.   But if you listen to the democrats, we're going to hell.  That's pretty  much the message.  The country is going hell.  It's savory and I just say,  poppycock to that.  So we're going to get into that immediately.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, it's a good word to use on a family channel.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I have an entire lexicon of things like that, like gooey  and poppycock, and balderdash.  So I will break all of that out.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  I think I heard you called the democrats  when it's coming into this plain nincompoops.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  You know what?  I actually called the  republicans nincompoops.</p><p> KELLY:  That's what it is.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  As thy are putting this together, this is -- </p><p> FORBES:  Another old word is knuckleheads.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Knuckleheads.  This is what we're going to talk about though,  that why do people not yet feel good about this tax reform?  Part of it is  the problem of how they put it together.  So we're going to talk about that  in two seconds.  I just want to tease our guests that are coming up,  Illinois congressman, Peter Roskam.  Fox News senior judicial analyst,  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Louisiana senator, John Kennedy.  Former  republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  And administrator of the  small business administration, Linda McMahaon.  There's a lot in this  package for small businesses as well.</p><p> But first, on the verge of a big tax victory.  Republicans are set to give  their final approval to a sweeping tax overhaul today after the senate  passed a plan and a late night vote.</p><p> House are scheduled a final vote this morning on the plan ready to send it  to President Trump's desk to sign it into law.</p><p> Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell says that both American businesses  and individual tax payers will see the benefit.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCCONNELL:  We had three, two quarters in a row of three percent growth.   Stock market is up.  Optimism is high.  Coupled with this tax reform,  America is ready to start performing as they should have for a number of  years.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The president congratulating lawmakers on Twitter, writing \"The  United States senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut in reform  barrel.  Terrible individual mandate, Obamacare repealed.  Goes to the  house tomorrow morning for a final vote.  If approved, there will be a news  conference at the White House at approximately 1:00 p.m.</p><p> Steve Forbes, we're on the precipice of passing this first major tax  overhaul.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" is saying certainly on the business  side, it actually does more in some ways than the '86 tax reform did in  terms of reforming corporate taxes.</p><p> FORBES:  The big news on the business side reducing the rate, corporate  rate down to 21 and pastors and its partnerships, Ascopr in the like which  how most American businesses organize for tax purposes.  They got that rate  down.  Looks like 29.6.  We'll have to see the final details on that.</p><p> Overseas earnings, no longer being penalized and bringing some of that cash  back home.  Instant expensing.  So if there are no sleepers in this bill,  and the market, I think would have fare the amount by now.  They did good  on that side.  The individual side is where they've got to do work the next  time.</p><p> And I hope today -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  When is the next time?  When is that?</p><p> FORBES:  Well, this is what they should announce today.  That oh, yes, it's  great history, since 1986 and all that good stuff.  What they should also  announce is this is a down payment.  This is the first of many big tax cuts  to come.  Give people anticipation, especially on the individual side.   We're going to keep slashing taxes because you the Americans create the  resources and can employ them better than Washington bureaucrats.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think the question though for many of us, is that really  possible if you look at the debt worth, 20 trillion in debt and people can  show that a national security issue.  So, can you -- is it really feasible  -- </p><p> FORBES:  What history shows -- experience shows is the only way you get a  balanced budget, if you want that is what the booming economy.  Late 1960s.   Kennedy tax cuts, finally in the 90s, after the Cold War and Reagan's Cold  War victory massive tax cuts.  So if you want to get the Russian's fiscal  situation under control, that economy where people feel good.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  On that note, Steve, the budget deficit has grown in the last  two years.  Spending has gone up, but not that much, it's because revenues  haven't been growing in the most recent fiscal year revenue grew at one  percent and in an expansion, it should be growing at three to five percent,  but this recovery, this growth period in American history has been so weak  because of regulations and because of flawed tax code quite frankly.</p><p> FORBES:  The last decade was at the worst economic growth since the 1930s.   And so that's why I think even deregulation sounds boring, but regulations  are attacks and the fact they are moving regulations, Washington isn't  getting up each morning figuring out how to make life more miserable for  business, has already had an impact.</p><p> And you're going to see now that this thing is going to be actually in  reality.  You're going to see much more investment.  And what democrats  refuse to recognize is, if you want a higher standard of living, you have  to have people making investments, creating those new products and  services, there's better paying jobs.</p><p> And one of the things they should emphasize is not just going to keep more  what you now earn, but your earnings, your pay is going to up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  Thank you.  To all of these democrats, not one  democrat voter for this plan.  And I tweeted this out earlier.  \"More than  80 percent of people, of taxpayers in this country, at least in the first  year are going to get a tax cut.  They're going to see more money in their  paycheck.</p><p> They're going to get to keep more of the money that they earned.  So try  running on that, because the democrats think that the messaging is that  again, the country that we -- this is a scam, whatever language that you  want to pit.</p><p> But again, try running on giving people more of their money.</p><p> KELLY:  Well, the problem is that democrats don't have any right to critic  this plan because none of them voted for it.  We're limited to $155  trillion.  We've seen under the previous administration that they didn't  even want to tackle deficits.  So we're in this vicious circle where all of  a sudden now the democrats have found religion when it comes to deficits.</p><p> But at the detriment of the American people that actually need strong  growth, they've been under the thumb of rules and regulations including the  Obamacare, as President Trump has alluded to.</p><p> But I think the important thing to take away from this is that it's cheaper  is for companies to invest here in the United States than it is abroad,  right?</p><p> But there was a detriment for them to invest here, when you can have four  corporations coming in and compete at a lower tax rate.  Look over at the  U.K., right?  Twenty percent corporate tax rate that are going to take to  17.5 percent.</p><p> We are nowhere near competitive.  We have one of the highest corporate tax  rates in the world.  So, how do you get companies to invest here?  You  unleash prosperity through property plan, equipment when they can reinvest  in a 21 percent rate.</p><p> FORBES:  One of the things that republicans should learn from this is get  rid of this constraint, from this congressional budget office, these fakes,  projections out 10 years that assume the tax cuts don't do much for the  economy, get rid of that.  Assume 3.5 percent growth and by golly have  greater muscular tax cuts.  One must be a tax cut in the future.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I need to get this.  This is what I want to you -- I want to get  your answer on this and it goes to the way that the democrats have been  messaging this.  While markets are optimistic about this tax plan, business  owners and operators are optimistic.  It remains unpopular with the  American people.  Actually, it's become more unpopular.</p><p> This is a new \"Wall Street Journal-NBC News\" poll that found 41 percent of  Americans say that the tax plan is a bad idea.  Just 24 percent of it say  it's a good idea.  Top republicans insist the numbers will shift in the  coming months.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCCONNELL:  My view of this, if we can't sell this to the American people,  we ought to go into another line of work.  I think this is an important  accomplishment for the country, that people will value and appreciate, but  obviously it requires us to continue this discussion.</p><p> REP.  PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  People are out there  on TV telling mistruth, disguising the facts of this thing.  That's going  to make it unpopular.  When we get this done, when people see the  withholding improving, when they see the jobs occurring, when they see  bigger paychecks, a fairer tax system, a simpler tax code, that's what's  going to produce the results.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Richard Rubin is the reporter at \"The Wall Street Journal\" and  he points out and I did as well on Twitter, 80 percent in the first year,  80 percent of households get a tax cut.  At least, if not more than that.   But 17 percent of people think they're getting tax cuts.  That is  unbelievable.</p><p> Bit to the democrats who are saying it's a scam.  Tom Perez, the head of  the DNC said in his statement taxes are going up.  Yet, taxes are going up  for people when these tax cuts expire, eight or ten years from now.  That's  a lie.</p><p> The American people are being told lies by the democrats.  But I say to  them, I say to these liberals who are messaging this, you know what?   People are going to get more money back.  They're going to see money in  their paychecks.  So good luck with that.</p><p> FORBES:  You see, one of the problems with the mainstream media is located  they're located in New York and California.  Many of them won't see a tax  cut because the loss of state and local deductions.</p><p> So in their little world this thing doesn't look so good.  They forget the  rest of the country.  And one of the things republicans have got to do is  more messaging.  Not just say the results and speak for themselves, but  explain to people why this is better and also start talking about payroll  reform.</p><p> Six years ago, they allowed for a couple of years people to keep their  first two points on the social security tax, even if you didn't pay income  tax, which many Americans don't.  You got a higher paycheck, so they should  put that on the table, say, if we get reelected, everyone in the work is  going to get another tax cut.  Start throwing out things for the future.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're not going to argue about that because the payroll tax --  well, the payroll tax goes to fund the benefit.  It goes to fund social  security and Medicare.</p><p> FORBES:  But the fact of the matter is they use the general budget when  they need it.  And they've used this for political purposes to make sure  everyone feels it for a couple of years and you do more muscular tax cuts.   So it's part of a plan -- set of this kiddy credit, which is a giveaway for  people </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have to go.  But I want to point something out.  When in this  country did we start believing that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and  democrats make better decisions with our money?  This is my money.  I think  I make better decisions about my life, my health and my money than those  elected officials who have their heels dug in down in D.C.</p><p> FORBES:  Even a buffets of democrats, I'll trust him more than Nancy  Pelosi.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> Coming up, a big blow for Uber in Europe.  A new ruling says that the  company should be regulated like taxis.  What it means for drivers and  users of the popular ridesharing app?</p><p> Plus, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, reportedly taking another step in its effort to  buy the Carolina Panthers.  New details on how Colin Kaepernick might be  involved.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This breaking news overnight.  The E.U. dealing a major setback  to Uber.  Lauren Simonetti has the details.  Lauren.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Dagen, the European court of  justice ruling that Uber should be regulated as a taxi company and not as a  digital service.  Uber has been trying to use courts to reduce their  regulatory oversight.  Uber claims that I's an app, so it could connect  drivers with passengers that they pick up.</p><p> Uber adds that the ruling should not have an immediate impact on how it  operates in Europe.  Shares -- well, it's not a publicly traded company.   Or at least not yet.</p><p>UPS ordering 125 of Tesla's all-electric semi-trucks.  This is the largest  public order for the big, thus far.  The Tesla trucks will cost about  $200,000 each.  Tesla expects them to be in production by 2019.</p><p> This is where I'm going to show you shares of Tesla.  They're up 1.1  percent at 334.92 in premarket trading.</p><p> Well, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs or Diddy, that's what his name is these days,  serious about buying the Carolina Panthers.  Yahoo Sports is reporting that  Diddy is huddling with potential investors hoping to put together an  ownership group.</p><p> Those efforts are expected to include Colin Kaepernick.  He and Diddy,  according to the report had a conversation and they discussed the former  NFL quarterback's role in any potential deal.  Panthers' owner Jerry  Richardson announced that he would be putting the franchise up for sale  amid sexual and racial misconduct allegations.  Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you think?</p><p> KELLY:  I mean, I think it's pretty interesting.  Well, getting back to the  Uber situation that most of the rules and regulations that come on this  technology companies, whether it's Google or Uber or any other is coming  from Europe.  And I think that's going to be a big thing going into next  year.</p><p> I think there's going to be a lot of rules and regulations coming,  especially to Facebook.  So, I think that's pretty telling.  We're starting  to see the ripples now.  We'll feel the effects next year.</p><p> FORBES:  And also shows why Britain pulled out of the E.U. is that they're  very anti-growth, anti-innovation.  Always has this guild medieval  mentality of something new comes along, we have much pressure and control  it</p><p> And you're right though.  In this country, the big tech companies don't  realize they're going into a political buzz saw because of their alleged  power and they haven't done -- in the old days, back before any of you were  born, the old AT&amp;T monopoly survived as long as it did, because it made  sure everyone was serviced, everyone -- every politician got free phone,  not free phone service during the campaign.  But they got the phone  service, every newspaper and the net.  They covered all their bases.</p><p> These tech companies, especially Google discriminating against  conservatives on what they're allowed to post.  That stuff is going to get  a political backlash.  I wish they'd wake up to this.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that they are waking up. I think that they are waking  up, that they realized the power of Washington and what they -- what might  be brought to bear on them.</p><p> FORBES:  They're still playing with the conservatives.</p><p> KELLY:  They're the biggest donors to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, and  so they're actually enabling this.  And so they're kind of blinded by kind  of their friends in Washington that aren't really going to be there to help  them out.</p><p> FORBES:  They have to realize there are two parties in this country.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll see the reaction of this tax reform because it's going to  feel good to a lot of them.</p><p> Coming up, ISIS, threatening attacks here and in Europe over the holiday  season.  The latest target, New Year's Eve.  How officials here in New York  City are stepping up security a week after that subway bomb blast.</p><p> And the divide in the fight against opioid abuse.  The overdose antidote  helping victims, but it may also put law enforcement at risk.  The  controversy, ahead.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A new terror warning.  ISIS releasing several disturbing  propaganda posters threatening attacks over the holiday season.  The latest  target?  New Year's Eve.  This comes a week and a half after an attempted  suicide bombing in New York City.</p><p> New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo has announced tightened security measures  over the holidays including increased personnel, bomb sniffing dogs and  even radiation detectors.</p><p> Joining us this morning is national security analyst at the Clarion  Project, professor of counterterrorism at Liberty University down at  Lynchburg, Virginia, Ryan Mauro.</p><p> Ryan, what do you make of this?</p><p> RYAN MAURO, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, CLARION PROJECT:  Well, of course  ISIS is going to be saying something like this.  For me, what the message  should be is even if they were to succeed in carrying out an attack, the  so-called lonewolf for those doesn't actually exist.  One guy goes off and  he kill some people.</p><p> Overall, they're still a bunch of losers.  Ninety-six percent of their  caliphate has been destroyed.  We need to start weaponizing Trump's  trolling.  Make fun of them for how many dumb things that they do and for a  group that claims that Allah is blessing them and on their side, well,  actually it kind of looks like if they all exist, he's on our side because  we're really killing them.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  You know, Ryan, I think you make such a good point because ISIS  has lost ground in the Middle East, essentially what it's trying to  establish is a cyber-caliphate and so it's trying to influence people.   People who are crazy.</p><p> A lot of these people who are lonewolf attackers don't really have a real  attachment to terrorist groups overseas, as you know.  And instead what  they're trying to do is reach people who are angry, people who want to take  that anger and hate out on people and then essentially get to them through  the internet.</p><p> But when you look at terror attacks in places like New York City, these  lonewolf attacks, what's so difficult is trying to identify them ahead of  time.  So you have some 3,000 police officers patrolling down the subway  systems for example in New York each day.</p><p> What they're really having to be able to do is assess people.  So how can  people better be able to asses people or officers and just people on the  streets to see if maybe they're -- to have those assessments in mind in  case they see some something and then they should say something.</p><p> MAURO:  Sure.  Great question.  The average civilian is just looking at  something like a backpack that's place somewhere.  That's kind of obvious  thing that made you uncomfortable reporting that type of thing.  For law  enforcement, I do a lot of training of law enforcement and what I'll teach  them is look for these dramatic overhauls in someone's personality because  that's what the radicalization process looks like.  Obsession.  He becomes  obsessed with the ideology.</p><p> They usually start alienating their friends and family because they become  real judgmental.  But I would say that when you look into the backgrounds  of these folks, yes, they may not initially have connections to a terrorist  group, per say, but they will have connections to a supposedly nonviolent  extremist movement.</p><p> You look far back into where these initial ideas kind of incubate and  you'll see connections to groups around the world that are considered  moderate by comparison, but still radical in repulsive and that's where I  think our attention should and that's why I think that congress really need  to investigate how the Obama administration impeded counterterrorism  investigations and prosecutions because that's the foundation where this  begins.</p><p> It's not about political points.  It's about figuring out where these  mistakes were made and going back and fixing them.</p><p> FORBED:  One of the things that happen a few years ago is the New York  police department had a good intelligence operation and then politically  they forward it.  Is that back up to full speed again?</p><p> MAURO:  Not really.  Because what happens is when something like that  occurs, you influence the culture.  And so you can still have  investigations on the street level, but those specific programs that were  shut down, even if you were to revive them -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Muslim communities and mosques just trying to figure out if  there is a would-be terrorist where the individual was working, where the  individual might be living and basically in secret.  But do you think --  New Yorkers are angry.</p><p> New Yorkers are angry that in 14 months, we've had three terror attacks.   Eight people killed over near the Westside highway on a bike path and then  after the fact, they put up concrete barricades, some of which are  decorated for Christmas.  People are irritated, they're angry, they're --  you know what and what is New York going to do about it?</p><p> MAURO:  Well, there a few different programs that were conflated.  The  biggest amount of lying that went on in the media and also pushed by  certain activist organizations was this idea that the NYPD was just spying  on Muslims for simply Muslim.</p><p> If you look at the stuff that real resources were put into, there are  always indications of extremism such as classes on how to disarm police.   If you get into a fight with cops.  That's a sign of extremism.  Start  there.</p><p> Believe it or not, those type of indicators are all over the place and  that's where you start.  And if you look at this as an ideological  insurgency, not a criminal intelligence problem, not even terrorism  problem, but an ideological insurgency and you say what is the  infrastructure for this problem.  Start there.  You'll find the bad guys.   It just requires some political incorrectness.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ryan, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  Ryan Mauro.  Again,  be vigilant.  Be vigilant.</p><p> Coming up, Facebook expanding the use of its facial recognition, but it's  raising new concerns over privacy.</p><p> And do you have one of the most popular computer passwords of the year?   We'll tell you why that's not a good thing.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, December 20th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Clearing  the final hurdles to tax reform, the Senate burning the midnight oil to  pass the largest tax code overhaul in three decades, the votes split  straight down party line, not one single Democrat defecting in support of  this bill.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE:  I think every  Democrat who votes against this and apparently, that's all of them in the  House and Senate, are saying, in effect, we are satisfied of where we are.   They're simply not interested in doing the kind of things that economists  believe will get the country growing again.</p><p> REP. STENY HOYER (D), MARYLAND:  There was no inclusion of Democrats in  this process.  When the senator says, you know, we want to give tax cut,  frankly, we want to give tax cut as well.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The House will vote on the updated bill today, likely sending it  to the President's desk.  Optimism over tax reform still fuelling these  markets, futures are showing gains across the board, 75 point gain on the  Dow futures right now.  It has been an incredible year for stocks.  Dow was  down about 37 points yesterday, but we are seeing the optimism return.</p><p> In Europe, we have losses across the board in England, France, and Germany,  and seems like the sung is picking up a little bit of steam in France and  Germany right now.  In Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower as well, the  slight gain for the Nikkei in Japan.  </p><p> Tragedy in Mexico, a tour bus carrying American cruise ship passengers  crashes, killing at least 12 people.  We have the latest from that  investigation ahead.  The opioid epidemic striking the workplace, alcohol  and drug-related overdoses at work, spike to new levels, how the government  is working to combat that growing health crisis.</p><p> And putting the face in Facebook, the social media site sparking privacy  concern with new facial recognition technology, why the company says it  added the feature, ahead.  And these aren't the passwords you're looking  for, Star Wars make its debut on the annual list of the worst passwords, we  will let you know what took the top spot this year.</p><p> But to our top story this half hour, the opioid epidemic hitting the  workplace, according to a new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  unintentional drug and alcohol overdose deaths at work spiked 32 percent in  2016.  The number tripling since the bureau began compiling data back in  2011.  Joining us this morning is Opiant Pharmaceuticals CEO, Doctor Roger  Crystal, Doctor, your company develops the easy-to-use overdose antidote,  NARCAN, which is a nasal spray, so you're at the forefront of combating  this opioid epidemic.  What do you think of these new statistics?</p><p> DR. ROGER CRYSTAL, CEO OF OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS:  For me, given my  background, this really isn't a surprise, actually, unfortunately.  The  opioid crisis has just continued to grow.  I'm from the U.K., originally,  and trained as a surgeon and there are those types of numbers that don't  yet exist, but part of that, kind of, the big driver of that has been,  unfortunately, in the past.  The over-prescribing of opioid painkillers,  and that's something that we need to address as a country alongside  treating all of these people who are unfortunately addicted to opioids and  alcohol.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Aren't we already doing that in terms of really reining in the  amount of opioids prescribed.  I mean, I personally experienced it with all  my doctors, you have -- you have dental surgery, they do not give you  Vicodin any longer.  In terms of it, even at the state level, it's -- you  have -- it is very, very hard to get a prescription for anything as  powerful as, like, Oxycodone or Oxycontin at this point.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  That's true that there are some measures in place already, so I  hope we do -- we will see a reduction.  I will say that even recently as  last year, there were still over 200 million opioid prescriptions made out  to approximately 20 million people.  So this is a huge issue and that  doesn't also address the two and a half million opioid addicts who we have  in this country already.  So we are really not there yet, I'm afraid. . KELLY:  Yes, so getting back to your product and what you guys do, you guys  have a nasal spray that people that are currently addicted to heroin take  or can you explain to us the product and you've got FDA approval and, kind  of, walk us through what you guys are doing.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  So, the product is called the NARCAN Nasal Spray and this saves  lives if someone with overdose from an opioid.  And when we say opioid,  yes, correct, it is something like heroin or Fentanyl, unfortunately, we  see there now, but also, just routine normal painkillers such as Oxycontin  and Vicodin and was -- I agree that they are being prescribed less.  </p><p> They are still overprescribed, and it's not for someone who's even  necessarily an addict.  I'm in good health, I don't abuse opioids, if my  dentist were to prescribe me Oxycontin, I will still be at risk of an  opioid overdose (INAUDIBLE) prudent for me to be prescribed the NARCAN  Nasal Spray alongside any opioid as a -- as a just in case measure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to get to why you're talking about NARCAN.  There  was a report recently that police departments are split over the use of  NARCAN, that some police officials are talking about like a resources for  obtaining, maintaining and tracking supplies, and for training in and when  how to use it, are you seeing any pushback from police departments when  they encounter rescue squads, ambulance services, paramedics, when they  encounter people who have overdosed for them using NARCAN?</p><p> CRYSTAL:  The feedback from ourselves and from our partners adapt farmers  as well.  There's no real pushback in terms of not wanting to recede the  NARCAN Nasal Spray.  It's easy to use, it saves lives, it's been FDA  approved.  So there's a real gratitude when they finally can get hold of it  because actually, it's something that people are then able to use and save  lives, the challenge about resources that is more -- a broader issue about  funding.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's true for some, but I know that Sheriff Jones in Butler  County Ohio, does not want his officers carrying this and it's because for  one thing. They say that, you know, law enforcement officials are supposed  to be able to enforce the law, not end up, basically, treating people who  are going to overdose again and again, and they see these repeat offenders.  </p><p> You know, they also say that sometimes, people come to and they actually  assault the person who was trying to help them.  There was an incident  about in Middle town where an injured firefighter was injured.  And so you  look at this, and you go, a firefighter is supposed to be fighting fires,  yet, they do, you know, give emergency medical help as well.  But gosh,  like, should they be carrying this around and then being put in this  position where they are -- they are expanding their duties to something  that they really are not supposed to be doing?</p><p> CRYSTAL:  Well, that represents this issue, a vast minority of people and  certainly, the (INAUDIBLE) you mentioned is very outspoken and that's  particularly rare.  The emergency responders in general, that is their  chance (INAUDIBLE) overall is to respond to an emergency, why, to  ultimately save lives and this is -- this is a very successful way of  saving a life if given appropriately.  And people if they get the right  training, should absolutely be well-handled to do so. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Your company got some good news about feasibility of a heroin  vaccine that's getting worse.  Tell us about that.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  So this is an early stage program that we are very fortunate to  have partnered with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and neither  the National Institute of Drug Abuse, so we have this program and we got  some recent news that's going to be published around the feasibility of  this heroin vaccine.  It's showing that not only does the vaccine seem to  work in an animal model against heroin, but also, activity with some of  these opioid painkillers as well.  </p><p> We are encouraged by that.  We also have the data to show that this can  potentially be scaled up and therefore, truly manufactured on the  commercial level once it gets into the clinics, so this is very important  even at this stage, when we are thinking about this as a proper product to  get out there.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA:  Can we get a  balance in pain management as, you know, 15 years ago, the rap against  medical profession was they weren't doing enough people in pain which led  to for whatever reason we have the crisis today.  What is the balance?</p><p> CRYSTAL:  The balance is a tough one to strike.  And I talked about my  experience in the U.K. as a surgeon there.  And by no means is the U.K.  perfect at all.  We probably didn't prescribe sufficient analgesia.  The  balance, really, to think about how we address that is starting off with  medical schools, and I say, medical, not just the M.D. medical, but dental  schools and anyone else who's interfacing with patients who are in pain.   Pain just doesn't need to be addressed with painkillers.  </p><p> I think that's the first thing that's really important to think about here.   Often physical therapy can be extremely helpful and in fact, patients need  to understand that some pain isn't, in fact, a bad thing, if they are  reassured, psychologically, that this is part of healing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But the backlash has been toward, and I speak from personal  experience, family experience, that people who are in critical pain, who  need opioids, who need Oxycontin, who need Oxycodone, who are fighting  stage 4 bone cancer.  It is incredibly difficult now to get prescription  refilled, that you have to have, and the supplies -- they give you a very  short supply.  </p><p> But these are people who literally can't get addicted because of the pain  levels they're experiencing.  These are deadly diseases and they're just  trying to manage their pain, but it's incredibly difficult.  Now, for these  people to even -- to go -- you have to drive -- my mother has to drive two  hours to get a paper prescription from her doctor every couple of weeks,  literally.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  No, absolutely.  And that's very unfortunate and the fact that  people who generally do require opioids, potentially are finding harder to  get access.  I absolutely sympathize tremendously in that situation.  The  issue we have is the vast majority of people probably not to be on opioids  in the first place.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  I mean, that's what's so --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, there it lies the personal responsibility, I have  conversations with friends and family all of the time, that if a doctor  ever offers to give you an opioid, you say no, I just had tooth pulled, I  don't need Vicodin for that.  And people are hesitant now, I think, at  least through the communication through the media, people are hesitant to  take opioids at all because they know they're so highly addictive, I mean,  it doesn't take much for some people to become chronically addicted to the  point that they can't stop taking it.</p><p> CRYSTAL:  Absolutely.  And the issue that we have here is that not everyone  is so willing to challenge (INAUDIBLE) and actually, it's a multifaceted  approach.  So, it's the historical marketing of drugs, it's the fact that  doctors have been overprescribing, it's the fact that patients aren't as  empowered as perhaps they have been, so it's very difficult to say there's  one specific area of responsibility but recognizing we have this crisis.  </p><p> We need to do something about it.  Part of it is to stop the  overprescribing and misprescribing of opioids and for where we play a role  as a company, is to treat addictions themselves.  Anyone who is an opioid  addict, the sooner you can get on definitive medical care and the longer  you can receive medical treatment, the far greater the likelihood of not  relapsing and actually going into long-term recovery and that's what we are  committed to.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Doctor Crystal, it's good to see you.  Doctor Roger Crystal,  thank you so much for being here.  Coming up, Delta says, pay up, the  airline calling on officials at Atlanta's Airport for compensation after  the massive power outage caused Delta to lose millions of dollars in  revenue because thousands of flights have to be canceled.  And (INAUDIBLE)  shares of the popular online retailer, Stitch Fix, tumbling after its first  earnings report as a public company, the details are next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, futures reporting to a higher open, 78-point gain  on the Dow Futures right now.  </p><p> We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  Stitch Fix shares unraveling in  pre-market following its first earnings report since its IPO.  The  personalized apparel company reporting strong customer gains, but it only  narrowly beat profit expectations because of expansion costs.  The company  is also struggled to convince investors it can keep up the growth.  Shares  are down 12 percent in premarket trading.  </p><p> And can the Blackberry turn around continue?  The former smartphone giant  is set to report its third-quarter earnings before the bell today.   Analysts are expecting revenue of about $215 million.  The company has  recently pivoted away from phones to cybersecurity software.  Blackberry  shares are up nearly 60 percent so far, this year.  </p><p> 12 people are dead after a tour bus crashes in Mexico, Lauren Simonetti has  details, Lauren.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Such a terrible story, Dagen.  The bus was carrying cruise ship  passengers on an (INAUDIBLE) in Mexico when it flipped over on a narrow  highway yesterday, killing 12 people; 20 others injured, including seven  Americans.  Royal Caribbean says passengers from two of its ships were on  that bus.  Investigators now are working to go figure out what caused the  crash.  </p><p> Well, Delta wants some money back.  The airline is seeking to be repaid for  lost revenue after Sunday's power outage at Hartsfield-Jackson  International Airport in Atlanta.  Delta CEO Bastian says, the airline may  have lost between 25 and $50 million of revenue as a result, and he plans  to talk to both the airport as well as Georgia Power.  That outage caused  Delta to cancel about 1400 flights, and they also had to put stranded  passengers up in hotel rooms.  Hartsfield-Jackson is Delta's main hub.   Taking a look at shares of the company, this year up about 13 percent.  </p><p> And can you believe that in 2017 people are still using password as their  password?  Here is a list of this year's most common password.  We'll start  with number three: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, really, I swear.  And second place  is: password, for the fourth year in a row.  The most common password of  the year: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  I don't even know how this is possible.   Because many Web sites, at least the one I use, make you change your  password, and then you have to have the capital letter, the number, the  symbol that you can't remember it, so you're constantly changing it.   Anyway, for those of you who still use \"password\", we have new passwords  that you might want to change to.  None of these are good, but they are  popular: \"let me in\", \"monkey\", and \"Star Wars\", made to the list of the  most common new password.  Dagen, what are your passwords?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what, I can't even remember them.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I only know them on the QWERTY keyboard by the keystrokes.  But  it's never -- you're not supposed to actually use a word ever, no word in  the dictionary, there should never be a word in your password.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Impossible to remember.</p><p> KELLY:  Can I just say that hope that one of the brain trusts of the  Democratic Party John Podesta watch this segment, the password for his e- mail which WikiLeaks got was \"p@ssword\" and the \"a\" was the \"@\" symbol.   So, hopefully, he watches this -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I thought that was pretty classy.</p><p> KELLY:  He knows not -- hopefully he didn't change it to \"Let me In\", or  \"Monkey,\" or \"Star Wars.\" </p><p> FORBES:  I hope the used the password for Democrats, tax cuts.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And needed little @.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you put in #tax, if you're going to tweet, the first thing  that comes up tax cut scam.  And it just makes me so angry because it's not  a -- the Democrats weren't involved in it, that doesn't mean it's a scam.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> FORBES:  No.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  But that's good marketing.  </p><p> KELLY:  No, it's a scam when you get to keep more of your own money.  It's  ridiculous.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But all hat -- all hat no cattle, is what that is.  Good  marketing, yes.  Good words, no action.  Coming up, control or creepy?   Facebook's expanded facial recognition, which will alert you if your  picture is posted through the social media site even if you're not tagged  in it.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Facebook raising new privacy concerns.  The company expanding  its facial recognition technology, it will now alert you if your photo is  posted to the social media site even if you're not tagged in it.  But  Facebook has a different spin, Gerry Willis is here with the details.  I  don't think it sounds like the worst idea, actually.  </p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FBN HOST:  It doesn't, and they're not saying that at all,  that we're going to hurt your privacy.  In fact, they're saying 180-degree  the opposite.  Here's what they say, if someone uploads a photo of your  face to Facebook, the company usually knows that it's you, thanks to facial  recognition technology.  Facebook will now alert people that a friend or a  friend of a friend, whoever uploaded a photo of them, even they haven't  been tagged in the picture.  </p><p> This is what Facebook says, \"We're doing this to prevent from people from  impersonating others on Facebook.\"  Facebook says it has no plans to use  facial recognition to enhance ads targeting.  That's the first thing I  thought of, that this has something to do with advertising.  Like, sharing  you more news feed post from friends who post and tag photos of you, or as  related to locations where you appear in untagged photos.  </p><p> For example, if you're in somebody's profile photo, which is always public,  you'll always be notified.  For other photos, though, you'll only get  notified if you're in the audience for that photo so as to protect the  uploader's privacy, and not alert you about photos you're not allowed to  see.  Facebook says, the feature is designed to give people more control  and make them feel safer because that's the ultimate goal in this society  that they're, at least, that everybody feels safe.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, impersonation is a huge problem on Facebook.  And I had --  somebody came -- was on air with us years ago and literally took, I'm not  joking, more than 30 photos in the building of themselves, and they tagged  me in every single photo and I wasn't in one of them.  And it was like the  most bizarre thing.  And so, why would you do that?  This is way -- this is  another step in preventing some kind of nonsense like that.  </p><p> WILLIS:  If you're not convinced to this?  You can have it undone of your  Facebook.  There's a way to delete it so that you don't have to be part of  this if you don't want to.  But I see what you're saying and makes a lot of  sense for people who are worried about impersonation.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  In fact, delete it from people who are trying to impersonate  people.  In others words --</p><p> WILLIS:  It will just alert.  It will tell you that somebody -- so, Dagen  who've known.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  What I mean is that there's a way in your security options or  something to prevent it from being in effect?  So, for somebody who wants  to try to impersonate somebody else -- </p><p> WILLIS:  Go find those people.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  They can figure it out.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We will know that something is not right if something's up if  you start like, if I have a pimple on my face and I start getting ads --  no, I start getting ads for Clear Fill.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a proactive face watch.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Dagen, never gets a pimple. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, that's not true.</p><p> KELLY:  I think this highlight, though, the omnipotent power of Facebook,  whether you recognize it or not.  Because they know you're in the photo.   So, you know, whether you're tagged it's you -- they know who are, and  that's how they track.</p><p> WILLIS:  I gave up with privacy a long time ago.</p><p> KELLY:  You are the product.  That's what it is.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Not just that but it's a --</p><p> FORBES:  In a way.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In a way.  We'll leave it.  Gerri, thank you.  Gerri Willis.   Still ahead, cellphone use, a public health issue.  It's what health  officials in California are warning.  The details are coming up on MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Senate making history. Republicans approving the largest overhaul of our country's tax system in about 30 years, early this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY: I'm a little surprised the democrats all decided voting against middle class tax relief and make American business more competitive as a smart vote and that's an argument we're more than happy to have.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: Eighty-three percent of the middle class will get -- will either pay more in taxes or get little breadcrumbs. Is that this great bill that's helping the middle class? Absolutely not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The house will vote on the bill later today, likely sending it to the <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>desk to sign.</p><p>The house originally did pass it yesterday, but there was a procedural snag that is forced the second vote. It was a snag over in the senate. Following the passage in the senate, futures are showing this happening in the markets. We had a slight full back in the Dow yesterday, off about 37 points. But we're seeing possibly new all-time highs for all your major market gauges.</p><p>By the way, you have highs on the transports earlier in the week on the Russell 2000. Literally every single market gauge in the U.S. has been moving in sync on the optimism from this tax reform package.</p><p>Over in Europe, checking on England, France and Germany, we have losses across the board. All those slight, all markets there down, lessen, about two tenths of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight stocks mostly lower as well. The Nikkei in Japan up ever so slightly.</p><p>ISIS threatening America. The terror group warning of the New Year's Eve attack.

The details as UPS delivers a big bet on the company's electric semi-truck.</p><p>And Diddy making moves to be the top cat down in Carolina. The music mogul reportedly meeting with ambassadors in his bid to buy the Panthers. How the teams could soon have a new owner. All of that and so much more coming up this morning.</p><p>Fox News correspondent, Lea Gabrielle, Benchmark managing partner, Kevin Kelly and Forbes Media chairman, former republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes.</p><p>When you walked in this morning, I went I am so glad you're here. Any day, but particularly this day, Mr. Forbes.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because we have the same feeling about this tax cut package. But if you listen to the democrats, we're going to hell. That's pretty much the message. The country is going hell. It's savory and I just say, poppycock to that. So we're going to get into that immediately.</p><p>FORBES: Yes, it's a good word to use on a family channel.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. I have an entire lexicon of things like that, like gooey and poppycock, and balderdash. So I will break all of that out.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: I think I heard you called the democrats when it's coming into this plain nincompoops.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: You know what? I actually called the republicans nincompoops.</p><p>KELLY: That's what it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: As thy are putting this together, this is --</p><p>FORBES: Another old word is knuckleheads.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Knuckleheads. This is what we're going to talk about though, that why do people not yet feel good about this tax reform? Part of it is the problem of how they put it together. So we're going to talk about that in two seconds. I just want to tease our guests that are coming up, Illinois congressman, Peter Roskam. Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Louisiana senator, John Kennedy. Former republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain. And administrator of the small business administration, Linda McMahaon. There's a lot in this package for small businesses as well.</p><p>But first, on the verge of a big tax victory. Republicans are set to give their final approval to a sweeping tax overhaul today after the senate passed a plan and a late night vote.</p><p>House are scheduled a final vote this morning on the plan ready to send it to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>desk to sign it into law.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell says that both American businesses and individual tax payers will see the benefit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCONNELL: We had three, two quarters in a row of three percent growth. Stock market is up. Optimism is high. Coupled with this tax reform, America is ready to start performing as they should have for a number of years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The president congratulating lawmakers on Twitter, writing \"The United States senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut in reform barrel. Terrible individual mandate, Obamacare repealed. Goes to the house tomorrow morning for a final vote. If approved, there will be a news conference at the White House at approximately 1:00 p.m.</p><p>Steve Forbes, we're on the precipice of passing this first major tax overhaul. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is saying certainly on the business side, it actually does more in some ways than the `86 tax reform did in terms of reforming corporate taxes.</p><p>FORBES: The big news on the business side reducing the rate, corporate rate down to 21 and pastors and its partnerships, Ascopr in the like which how most American businesses organize for tax purposes. They got that rate down. Looks like 29.6. We'll have to see the final details on that.</p><p>Overseas earnings, no longer being penalized and bringing some of that cash back home. Instant expensing. So if there are no sleepers in this bill, and the market, I think would have fare the amount by now. They did good on that side. The individual side is where they've got to do work the next time.</p><p>And I hope today --</p><p>GABRIELLE: When is the next time? When is that?</p><p>FORBES: Well, this is what they should announce today. That oh, yes, it's great history, since 1986 and all that good stuff. What they should also announce is this is a down payment. This is the first of many big tax cuts to come. Give people anticipation, especially on the individual side. We're going to keep slashing taxes because you the Americans create the resources and can employ them better than Washington bureaucrats.</p><p>GABRIELLE: I think the question though for many of us, is that really possible if you look at the debt worth, 20 trillion in debt and people can show that a national security issue. So, can you -- is it really feasible --</p><p>FORBES: What history shows -- experience shows is the only way you get a balanced budget, if you want that is what the booming economy. Late 1960s. Kennedy tax cuts, finally in the 90s, after the Cold War and Reagan's Cold War victory massive tax cuts. So if you want to get the Russian's fiscal situation under control, that economy where people feel good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: On that note, Steve, the budget deficit has grown in the last two years. Spending has gone up, but not that much, it's because revenues haven't been growing in the most recent fiscal year revenue grew at one percent and in an expansion, it should be growing at three to five percent, but this recovery, this growth period in American history has been so weak because of regulations and because of flawed tax code quite frankly.</p><p>FORBES: The last decade was at the worst economic growth since the 1930s. And so that's why I think even deregulation sounds boring, but regulations are attacks and the fact they are moving regulations, Washington isn't getting up each morning figuring out how to make life more miserable for business, has already had an impact.</p><p>And you're going to see now that this thing is going to be actually in reality. You're going to see much more investment. And what democrats refuse to recognize is, if you want a higher standard of living, you have to have people making investments, creating those new products and services, there's better paying jobs.</p><p>And one of the things they should emphasize is not just going to keep more what you now earn, but your earnings, your pay is going to up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you. Thank you. To all of these democrats, not one democrat voter for this plan. And I tweeted this out earlier. \"More than 80 percent of people, of taxpayers in this country, at least in the first year are going to get a tax cut. They're going to see more money in their paycheck.</p><p>They're going to get to keep more of the money that they earned. So try running on that, because the democrats think that the messaging is that again, the country that we -- this is a scam, whatever language that you want to pit.</p><p>But again, try running on giving people more of their money.</p><p>KELLY: Well, the problem is that democrats don't have any right to critic this plan because none of them voted for it. We're limited to $155 trillion. We've seen under the previous administration that they didn't even want to tackle deficits. So we're in this vicious circle where all of a sudden now the democrats have found religion when it comes to deficits.</p><p>But at the detriment of the American people that actually need strong growth, they've been under the thumb of rules and regulations including the Obamacare, as <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has alluded to.</p><p>But I think the important thing to take away from this is that it's cheaper is for companies to invest here in the United States than it is abroad, right?</p><p>But there was a detriment for them to invest here, when you can have four corporations coming in and compete at a lower tax rate. Look over at the U.K., right? Twenty percent corporate tax rate that are going to take to 17.5 percent.</p><p>We are nowhere near competitive. We have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. So, how do you get companies to invest here? You unleash prosperity through property plan, equipment when they can reinvest in a 21 percent rate.</p><p>FORBES: One of the things that republicans should learn from this is get rid of this constraint, from this congressional budget office, these fakes, projections out 10 years that assume the tax cuts don't do much for the economy, get rid of that. Assume 3.5 percent growth and by golly have greater muscular tax cuts. One must be a tax cut in the future.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I need to get this. This is what I want to you -- I want to get your answer on this and it goes to the way that the democrats have been messaging this. While markets are optimistic about this tax plan, business owners and operators are optimistic. It remains unpopular with the American people. Actually, it's become more unpopular.</p><p>This is a new \"Wall Street Journal-NBC News\" poll that found 41 percent of Americans say that the tax plan is a bad idea. Just 24 percent of it say it's a good idea. Top republicans insist the numbers will shift in the coming months. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCONNELL: My view of this, if we can't sell this to the American people, we ought to go into another line of work. I think this is an important accomplishment for the country, that people will value and appreciate, but obviously it requires us to continue this discussion.</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: People are out there on TV telling mistruth, disguising the facts of this thing. That's going to make it unpopular. When we get this done, when people see the withholding improving, when they see the jobs occurring, when they see bigger paychecks, a fairer tax system, a simpler tax code, that's what's going to produce the results.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Richard Rubin is the reporter at \"The Wall Street Journal\" and he points out and I did as well on Twitter, 80 percent in the first year, 80 percent of households get a tax cut. At least, if not more than that. But 17 percent of people think they're getting tax cuts. That is unbelievable.</p><p>Bit to the democrats who are saying it's a scam. Tom Perez, the head of the DNC said in his statement taxes are going up. Yet, taxes are going up for people when these tax cuts expire, eight or ten years from now. That's a lie.</p><p>The American people are being told lies by the democrats. But I say to them, I say to these liberals who are messaging this, you know what? People are going to get more money back. They're going to see money in their paychecks. So good luck with that.</p><p>FORBES: You see, one of the problems with the mainstream media is located they're located in New York and California. Many of them won't see a tax cut because the loss of state and local deductions.</p><p>So in their little world this thing doesn't look so good. They forget the rest of the country. And one of the things republicans have got to do is more messaging. Not just say the results and speak for themselves, but explain to people why this is better and also start talking about payroll reform.</p><p>Six years ago, they allowed for a couple of years people to keep their first two points on the social security tax, even if you didn't pay income tax, which many Americans don't. You got a higher paycheck, so they should put that on the table, say, if we get reelected, everyone in the work is going to get another tax cut. Start throwing out things for the future.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're not going to argue about that because the payroll tax -- well, the payroll tax goes to fund the benefit. It goes to fund social security and Medicare.</p><p>FORBES: But the fact of the matter is they use the general budget when they need it. And they've used this for political purposes to make sure everyone feels it for a couple of years and you do more muscular tax cuts. So it's part of a plan -- set of this kiddy credit, which is a giveaway for people</p><p>MCDOWELL: We have to go. But I want to point something out. When in this country did we start believing that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and democrats make better decisions with our money? This is my money. I think I make better decisions about my life, my health and my money than those elected officials who have their heels dug in down in D.C.</p><p>FORBES: Even a buffets of democrats, I'll trust him more than Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a big blow for Uber in Europe. A new ruling says that the company should be regulated like taxis. What it means for drivers and users of the popular ridesharing app?</p><p>Plus, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, reportedly taking another step in its effort to buy the Carolina Panthers. New details on how Colin Kaepernick might be involved.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCDOWELL: This breaking news overnight. The E.U. dealing a major setback to Uber. Lauren Simonetti has the details. Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Dagen, the European court of justice ruling that Uber should be regulated as a taxi company and not as a digital service. Uber has been trying to use courts to reduce their regulatory oversight. Uber claims that I's an app, so it could connect drivers with passengers that they pick up.</p><p>Uber adds that the ruling should not have an immediate impact on how it operates in Europe. Shares -- well, it's not a publicly traded company. Or at least not yet.</p><p>UPS ordering 125 of Tesla's all-electric semi-trucks. This is the largest public order for the big, thus far. The Tesla trucks will cost about $200,000 each. Tesla expects them to be in production by 2019.</p><p>This is where I'm going to show you shares of Tesla. They're up 1.1 percent at 334.92 in premarket trading.</p><p>Well, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs or Diddy, that's what his name is these days, serious about buying the Carolina Panthers. Yahoo Sports is reporting that Diddy is huddling with potential investors hoping to put together an ownership group.</p><p>Those efforts are expected to include Colin Kaepernick. He and Diddy, according to the report had a conversation and they discussed the former NFL quarterback's role in any potential deal. Panthers' owner Jerry Richardson announced that he would be putting the franchise up for sale amid sexual and racial misconduct allegations. Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What do you think?</p><p>KELLY: I mean, I think it's pretty interesting. Well, getting back to the Uber situation that most of the rules and regulations that come on this technology companies, whether it's Google or Uber or any other is coming from Europe. And I think that's going to be a big thing going into next year.</p><p>I think there's going to be a lot of rules and regulations coming, especially to Facebook. So, I think that's pretty telling. We're starting to see the ripples now. We'll feel the effects next year.</p><p>FORBES: And also shows why Britain pulled out of the E.U. is that they're very anti-growth, anti-innovation. Always has this guild medieval mentality of something new comes along, we have much pressure and control it</p><p>And you're right though. In this country, the big tech companies don't realize they're going into a political buzz saw because of their alleged power and they haven't done -- in the old days, back before any of you were born, the old AT&amp;T monopoly survived as long as it did, because it made sure everyone was serviced, everyone -- every politician got free phone, not free phone service during the campaign. But they got the phone service, every newspaper and the net. They covered all their bases.</p><p>These tech companies, especially Google discriminating against conservatives on what they're allowed to post. That stuff is going to get a political backlash. I wish they'd wake up to this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that they are waking up. I think that they are waking up, that they realized the power of Washington and what they -- what might be brought to bear on them.</p><p>FORBES: They're still playing with the conservatives.</p><p>KELLY: They're the biggest donors to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, and so they're actually enabling this. And so they're kind of blinded by kind of their friends in Washington that aren't really going to be there to help them out.</p><p>FORBES: They have to realize there are two parties in this country.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll see the reaction of this tax reform because it's going to feel good to a lot of them.</p><p>Coming up, ISIS, threatening attacks here and in Europe over the holiday season. The latest target, New Year's Eve. How officials here in New York City are stepping up security a week after that subway bomb blast.</p><p>And the divide in the fight against opioid abuse. The overdose antidote helping victims, but it may also put law enforcement at risk. The controversy, ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCDOWELL: A new terror warning. ISIS releasing several disturbing propaganda posters threatening attacks over the holiday season. The latest target? New Year's Eve. This comes a week and a half after an attempted suicide bombing in New York City.</p><p>New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo has announced tightened security measures over the holidays including increased personnel, bomb sniffing dogs and even radiation detectors.</p><p>Joining us this morning is national security analyst at the Clarion Project, professor of counterterrorism at Liberty University down at Lynchburg, Virginia, Ryan Mauro.</p><p>Ryan, what do you make of this?</p><p>RYAN MAURO, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, CLARION PROJECT: Well, of course ISIS is going to be saying something like this. For me, what the message should be is even if they were to succeed in carrying out an attack, the so-called lonewolf for those doesn't actually exist. One guy goes off and he kill some people.</p><p>Overall, they're still a bunch of losers. Ninety-six percent of their caliphate has been destroyed. We need to start weaponizing Trump's trolling. Make fun of them for how many dumb things that they do and for a group that claims that Allah is blessing them and on their side, well, actually it kind of looks like if they all exist, he's on our side because we're really killing them.</p><p>GABRIELLE: You know, Ryan, I think you make such a good point because ISIS has lost ground in the Middle East, essentially what it's trying to establish is a cyber-caliphate and so it's trying to influence people. People who are crazy.</p><p>A lot of these people who are lonewolf attackers don't really have a real attachment to terrorist groups overseas, as you know. And instead what they're trying to do is reach people who are angry, people who want to take that anger and hate out on people and then essentially get to them through the internet.</p><p>But when you look at terror attacks in places like New York City, these lonewolf attacks, what's so difficult is trying to identify them ahead of time. So you have some 3,000 police officers patrolling down the subway systems for example in New York each day.</p><p>What they're really having to be able to do is assess people. So how can people better be able to asses people or officers and just people on the streets to see if maybe they're -- to have those assessments in mind in case they see some something and then they should say something.</p><p>MAURO: Sure. Great question. The average civilian is just looking at something like a backpack that's place somewhere. That's kind of obvious thing that made you uncomfortable reporting that type of thing. For law enforcement, I do a lot of training of law enforcement and what I'll teach them is look for these dramatic overhauls in someone's personality because that's what the radicalization process looks like. Obsession. He becomes obsessed with the ideology.</p><p>They usually start alienating their friends and family because they become real judgmental. But I would say that when you look into the backgrounds of these folks, yes, they may not initially have connections to a terrorist group, per say, but they will have connections to a supposedly nonviolent extremist movement.</p><p>You look far back into where these initial ideas kind of incubate and you'll see connections to groups around the world that are considered moderate by comparison, but still radical in repulsive and that's where I think our attention should and that's why I think that congress really need to investigate how the Obama administration impeded counterterrorism investigations and prosecutions because that's the foundation where this begins.</p><p>It's not about political points. It's about figuring out where these mistakes were made and going back and fixing them.</p><p>FORBED: One of the things that happen a few years ago is the New York police department had a good intelligence operation and then politically they forward it. Is that back up to full speed again?</p><p>MAURO: Not really. Because what happens is when something like that occurs, you influence the culture. And so you can still have investigations on the street level, but those specific programs that were shut down, even if you were to revive them --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Muslim communities and mosques just trying to figure out if there is a would-be terrorist where the individual was working, where the individual might be living and basically in secret. But do you think -- New Yorkers are angry.</p><p>New Yorkers are angry that in 14 months, we've had three terror attacks. Eight people killed over near the Westside highway on a bike path and then after the fact, they put up concrete barricades, some of which are decorated for Christmas. People are irritated, they're angry, they're -- you know what and what is New York going to do about it?</p><p>MAURO: Well, there a few different programs that were conflated. The biggest amount of lying that went on in the media and also pushed by certain activist organizations was this idea that the NYPD was just spying on Muslims for simply Muslim.</p><p>If you look at the stuff that real resources were put into, there are always indications of extremism such as classes on how to disarm police. If you get into a fight with cops. That's a sign of extremism. Start there.</p><p>Believe it or not, those type of indicators are all over the place and that's where you start. And if you look at this as an ideological insurgency, not a criminal intelligence problem, not even terrorism problem, but an ideological insurgency and you say what is the infrastructure for this problem. Start there. You'll find the bad guys. It just requires some political incorrectness.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ryan, good to see you. Thank you so much. Ryan Mauro. Again, be vigilant. Be vigilant.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook expanding the use of its facial recognition, but it's raising new concerns over privacy.</p><p>And do you have one of the most popular computer passwords of the year? We'll tell you why that's not a good thing.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Wednesday, December 20th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern. Clearing the final hurdles to tax reform, the Senate burning the midnight oil to pass the largest tax code overhaul in three decades, the votes split straight down party line, not one single Democrat defecting in support of this bill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE: I think every Democrat who votes against this and apparently, that's all of them in the House and Senate, are saying, in effect, we are satisfied of where we are. They're simply not interested in doing the kind of things that economists believe will get the country growing again.</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER (D), MARYLAND: There was no inclusion of Democrats in this process. When the senator says, you know, we want to give tax cut, frankly, we want to give tax cut as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The House will vote on the updated bill today, likely sending it to the President's desk. Optimism over tax reform still fuelling these markets, futures are showing gains across the board, 75 point gain on the Dow futures right now. It has been an incredible year for stocks. Dow was down about 37 points yesterday, but we are seeing the optimism return.</p><p>In Europe, we have losses across the board in England, France, and Germany, and seems like the sung is picking up a little bit of steam in France and Germany right now. In Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower as well, the slight gain for the Nikkei in Japan.</p><p>Tragedy in Mexico, a tour bus carrying American cruise ship passengers crashes, killing at least 12 people. We have the latest from that investigation ahead. The opioid epidemic striking the workplace, alcohol and drug-related overdoses at work, spike to new levels, how the government is working to combat that growing health crisis.</p><p>And putting the face in Facebook, the social media site sparking privacy concern with new facial recognition technology, why the company says it added the feature, ahead. And these aren't the passwords you're looking for, Star Wars make its debut on the annual list of the worst passwords, we will let you know what took the top spot this year.</p><p>But to our top story this half hour, the opioid epidemic hitting the workplace, according to a new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unintentional drug and alcohol overdose deaths at work spiked 32 percent in 2016. The number tripling since the bureau began compiling data back in 2011. Joining us this morning is Opiant Pharmaceuticals CEO, Doctor Roger Crystal, Doctor, your company develops the easy-to-use overdose antidote, NARCAN, which is a nasal spray, so you're at the forefront of combating this opioid epidemic. What do you think of these new statistics?</p><p>DR. ROGER CRYSTAL, CEO OF OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS: For me, given my background, this really isn't a surprise, actually, unfortunately. The opioid crisis has just continued to grow. I'm from the U.K., originally, and trained as a surgeon and there are those types of numbers that don't yet exist, but part of that, kind of, the big driver of that has been, unfortunately, in the past. The over-prescribing of opioid painkillers, and that's something that we need to address as a country alongside treating all of these people who are unfortunately addicted to opioids and alcohol.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Aren't we already doing that in terms of really reining in the amount of opioids prescribed. I mean, I personally experienced it with all my doctors, you have -- you have dental surgery, they do not give you Vicodin any longer. In terms of it, even at the state level, it's -- you have -- it is very, very hard to get a prescription for anything as powerful as, like, Oxycodone or Oxycontin at this point.</p><p>CRYSTAL: That's true that there are some measures in place already, so I hope we do -- we will see a reduction. I will say that even recently as last year, there were still over 200 million opioid prescriptions made out to approximately 20 million people. So this is a huge issue and that doesn't also address the two and a half million opioid addicts who we have in this country already. So we are really not there yet, I'm afraid. . KELLY: Yes, so getting back to your product and what you guys do, you guys have a nasal spray that people that are currently addicted to heroin take or can you explain to us the product and you've got FDA approval and, kind of, walk us through what you guys are doing.</p><p>CRYSTAL: So, the product is called the NARCAN Nasal Spray and this saves lives if someone with overdose from an opioid. And when we say opioid, yes, correct, it is something like heroin or Fentanyl, unfortunately, we see there now, but also, just routine normal painkillers such as Oxycontin and Vicodin and was -- I agree that they are being prescribed less.</p><p>They are still overprescribed, and it's not for someone who's even necessarily an addict. I'm in good health, I don't abuse opioids, if my dentist were to prescribe me Oxycontin, I will still be at risk of an opioid overdose (INAUDIBLE) prudent for me to be prescribed the NARCAN Nasal Spray alongside any opioid as a -- as a just in case measure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to get to why you're talking about NARCAN. There was a report recently that police departments are split over the use of NARCAN, that some police officials are talking about like a resources for obtaining, maintaining and tracking supplies, and for training in and when how to use it, are you seeing any pushback from police departments when they encounter rescue squads, ambulance services, paramedics, when they encounter people who have overdosed for them using NARCAN?</p><p>CRYSTAL: The feedback from ourselves and from our partners adapt farmers as well. There's no real pushback in terms of not wanting to recede the NARCAN Nasal Spray. It's easy to use, it saves lives, it's been FDA approved. So there's a real gratitude when they finally can get hold of it because actually, it's something that people are then able to use and save lives, the challenge about resources that is more -- a broader issue about funding.</p><p>GABRIELLE: That's true for some, but I know that Sheriff Jones in Butler CountyOhio, does not want his officers carrying this and it's because for one thing. They say that, you know, law enforcement officials are supposed to be able to enforce the law, not end up, basically, treating people who are going to overdose again and again, and they see these repeat offenders.</p><p>You know, they also say that sometimes, people come to and they actually assault the person who was trying to help them. There was an incident about in Middle town where an injured firefighter was injured. And so you look at this, and you go, a firefighter is supposed to be fighting fires, yet, they do, you know, give emergency medical help as well. But gosh, like, should they be carrying this around and then being put in this position where they are -- they are expanding their duties to something that they really are not supposed to be doing?</p><p>CRYSTAL: Well, that represents this issue, a vast minority of people and certainly, the (INAUDIBLE) you mentioned is very outspoken and that's particularly rare. The emergency responders in general, that is their chance (INAUDIBLE) overall is to respond to an emergency, why, to ultimately save lives and this is -- this is a very successful way of saving a life if given appropriately. And people if they get the right training, should absolutely be well-handled to do so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Your company got some good news about feasibility of a heroin vaccine that's getting worse. Tell us about that.</p><p>CRYSTAL: So this is an early stage program that we are very fortunate to have partnered with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and neither the National Institute of Drug Abuse, so we have this program and we got some recent news that's going to be published around the feasibility of this heroin vaccine. It's showing that not only does the vaccine seem to work in an animal model against heroin, but also, activity with some of these opioid painkillers as well.</p><p>We are encouraged by that. We also have the data to show that this can potentially be scaled up and therefore, truly manufactured on the commercial level once it gets into the clinics, so this is very important even at this stage, when we are thinking about this as a proper product to get out there.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA: Can we get a balance in pain management as, you know, 15 years ago, the rap against medical profession was they weren't doing enough people in pain which led to for whatever reason we have the crisis today. What is the balance?</p><p>CRYSTAL: The balance is a tough one to strike. And I talked about my experience in the U.K. as a surgeon there. And by no means is the U.K. perfect at all. We probably didn't prescribe sufficient analgesia. The balance, really, to think about how we address that is starting off with medical schools, and I say, medical, not just the M.D. medical, but dental schools and anyone else who's interfacing with patients who are in pain. Pain just doesn't need to be addressed with painkillers.</p><p>I think that's the first thing that's really important to think about here. Often physical therapy can be extremely helpful and in fact, patients need to understand that some pain isn't, in fact, a bad thing, if they are reassured, psychologically, that this is part of healing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the backlash has been toward, and I speak from personal experience, family experience, that people who are in critical pain, who need opioids, who need Oxycontin, who need Oxycodone, who are fighting stage 4 bone cancer. It is incredibly difficult now to get prescription refilled, that you have to have, and the supplies -- they give you a very short supply.</p><p>But these are people who literally can't get addicted because of the pain levels they're experiencing. These are deadly diseases and they're just trying to manage their pain, but it's incredibly difficult. Now, for these people to even -- to go -- you have to drive -- my mother has to drive two hours to get a paper prescription from her doctor every couple of weeks, literally.</p><p>CRYSTAL: No, absolutely. And that's very unfortunate and the fact that people who generally do require opioids, potentially are finding harder to get access. I absolutely sympathize tremendously in that situation. The issue we have is the vast majority of people probably not to be on opioids in the first place.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>CRYSTAL: I mean, that's what's so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, there it lies the personal responsibility, I have conversations with friends and family all of the time, that if a doctor ever offers to give you an opioid, you say no, I just had tooth pulled, I don't need Vicodin for that. And people are hesitant now, I think, at least through the communication through the media, people are hesitant to take opioids at all because they know they're so highly addictive, I mean, it doesn't take much for some people to become chronically addicted to the point that they can't stop taking it.</p><p>CRYSTAL: Absolutely. And the issue that we have here is that not everyone is so willing to challenge (INAUDIBLE) and actually, it's a multifaceted approach. So, it's the historical marketing of drugs, it's the fact that doctors have been overprescribing, it's the fact that patients aren't as empowered as perhaps they have been, so it's very difficult to say there's one specific area of responsibility but recognizing we have this crisis.</p><p>We need to do something about it. Part of it is to stop the overprescribing and misprescribing of opioids and for where we play a role as a company, is to treat addictions themselves. Anyone who is an opioid addict, the sooner you can get on definitive medical care and the longer you can receive medical treatment, the far greater the likelihood of not relapsing and actually going into long-term recovery and that's what we are committed to.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Doctor Crystal, it's good to see you. Doctor Roger Crystal, thank you so much for being here. Coming up, Delta says, pay up, the airline calling on officials at Atlanta's Airport for compensation after the massive power outage caused Delta to lose millions of dollars in revenue because thousands of flights have to be canceled. And (INAUDIBLE) shares of the popular online retailer, Stitch Fix, tumbling after its first earnings report as a public company, the details are next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back, futures reporting to a higher open, 78-point gain on the Dow Futures right now.</p><p>We're looking at a few stocks on the move. Stitch Fix shares unraveling in pre-market following its first earnings report since its IPO. The personalized apparel company reporting strong customer gains, but it only narrowly beat profit expectations because of expansion costs. The company is also struggled to convince investors it can keep up the growth. Shares are down 12 percent in premarket trading.</p><p>And can the Blackberry turn around continue? The former smartphone giant is set to report its third-quarter earnings before the bell today. Analysts are expecting revenue of about $215 million. The company has recently pivoted away from phones to cybersecurity software. Blackberry shares are up nearly 60 percent so far, this year.</p><p>12 people are dead after a tour bus crashes in Mexico, Lauren Simonetti has details, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Such a terrible story, Dagen. The bus was carrying cruise ship passengers on an (INAUDIBLE) in Mexico when it flipped over on a narrow highway yesterday, killing 12 people; 20 others injured, including seven Americans. Royal Caribbean says passengers from two of its ships were on that bus. Investigators now are working to go figure out what caused the crash.</p><p>Well, Delta wants some money back. The airline is seeking to be repaid for lost revenue after Sunday's power outage at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. Delta CEO Bastian says, the airline may have lost between 25 and $50 million of revenue as a result, and he plans to talk to both the airport as well as Georgia Power. That outage caused Delta to cancel about 1400 flights, and they also had to put stranded passengers up in hotel rooms. Hartsfield-Jackson is Delta's main hub. Taking a look at shares of the company, this year up about 13 percent.</p><p>And can you believe that in 2017 people are still using password as their password? Here is a list of this year's most common password. We'll start with number three: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, really, I swear. And second place is: password, for the fourth year in a row. The most common password of the year: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I don't even know how this is possible. Because many Web sites, at least the one I use, make you change your password, and then you have to have the capital letter, the number, the symbol that you can't remember it, so you're constantly changing it. Anyway, for those of you who still use \"password\", we have new passwords that you might want to change to. None of these are good, but they are popular: \"let me in\", \"monkey\", and \"Star Wars\", made to the list of the most common new password. Dagen, what are your passwords?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what, I can't even remember them.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I only know them on the QWERTY keyboard by the keystrokes. But it's never -- you're not supposed to actually use a word ever, no word in the dictionary, there should never be a word in your password.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Impossible to remember.</p><p>KELLY: Can I just say that hope that one of the brain trusts of the Democratic Party John Podesta watch this segment, the password for his e- mail which WikiLeaks got was \"p@ssword\" and the \"a\" was the \"@\" symbol. So, hopefully, he watches this --</p><p>GABRIELLE: I thought that was pretty classy.</p><p>KELLY: He knows not -- hopefully he didn't change it to \"Let me In\", or \"Monkey,\" or \"Star Wars.\"</p><p>FORBES: I hope the used the password for Democrats, tax cuts.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GABRIELLE: And needed little @.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you put in #tax, if you're going to tweet, the first thing that comes up tax cut scam. And it just makes me so angry because it's not a -- the Democrats weren't involved in it, that doesn't mean it's a scam.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FORBES: No.</p><p>GABRIELLE: But that's good marketing.</p><p>KELLY: No, it's a scam when you get to keep more of your own money. It's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. But all hat -- all hat no cattle, is what that is. Good marketing, yes. Good words, no action. Coming up, control or creepy? Facebook's expanded facial recognition, which will alert you if your picture is posted through the social media site even if you're not tagged in it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Facebook raising new privacy concerns. The company expanding its facial recognition technology, it will now alert you if your photo is posted to the social media site even if you're not tagged in it. But Facebook has a different spin, Gerry Willis is here with the details. I don't think it sounds like the worst idea, actually.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FBN HOST: It doesn't, and they're not saying that at all, that we're going to hurt your privacy. In fact, they're saying 180-degree the opposite. Here's what they say, if someone uploads a photo of your face to Facebook, the company usually knows that it's you, thanks to facial recognition technology. Facebook will now alert people that a friend or a friend of a friend, whoever uploaded a photo of them, even they haven't been tagged in the picture.</p><p>This is what Facebook says, \"We're doing this to prevent from people from impersonating others on Facebook.\" Facebook says it has no plans to use facial recognition to enhance ads targeting. That's the first thing I thought of, that this has something to do with advertising. Like, sharing you more news feed post from friends who post and tag photos of you, or as related to locations where you appear in untagged photos.</p><p>For example, if you're in somebody's profile photo, which is always public, you'll always be notified. For other photos, though, you'll only get notified if you're in the audience for that photo so as to protect the uploader's privacy, and not alert you about photos you're not allowed to see. Facebook says, the feature is designed to give people more control and make them feel safer because that's the ultimate goal in this society that they're, at least, that everybody feels safe.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, impersonation is a huge problem on Facebook. And I had -- somebody came -- was on air with us years ago and literally took, I'm not joking, more than 30 photos in the building of themselves, and they tagged me in every single photo and I wasn't in one of them. And it was like the most bizarre thing. And so, why would you do that? This is way -- this is another step in preventing some kind of nonsense like that.</p><p>WILLIS: If you're not convinced to this? You can have it undone of your Facebook. There's a way to delete it so that you don't have to be part of this if you don't want to. But I see what you're saying and makes a lot of sense for people who are worried about impersonation.</p><p>GABRIELLE: In fact, delete it from people who are trying to impersonate people. In others words --</p><p>WILLIS: It will just alert. It will tell you that somebody -- so, Dagen who've known.</p><p>GABRIELLE: What I mean is that there's a way in your security options or something to prevent it from being in effect? So, for somebody who wants to try to impersonate somebody else --</p><p>WILLIS: Go find those people.</p><p>GABRIELLE: They can figure it out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We will know that something is not right if something's up if you start like, if I have a pimple on my face and I start getting ads -- no, I start getting ads for Clear Fill.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's a proactive face watch. And I'm like, wait a minute.</p><p>GABRIELLE: Dagen, never gets a pimple.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, that's not true.</p><p>KELLY: I think this highlight, though, the omnipotent power of Facebook, whether you recognize it or not. Because they know you're in the photo. So, you know, whether you're tagged it's you -- they know who are, and that's how they track.</p><p>WILLIS: I gave up with privacy a long time ago.</p><p>KELLY: You are the product. That's what it is.</p><p>GABRIELLE: Not just that but it's a --</p><p>FORBES: In a way.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In a way. We'll leave it. Gerri, thank you. Gerri Willis. Still ahead, cellphone use, a public health issue. It's what health officials in California are warning. The details are coming up on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2017122001cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R74-4GH1-JB20-G10K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7528\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 20, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I already explained most of the problems with this version of the law in this post[1]. For now, I'll just say that I hope the bill supporters are right and that the law actually helps sex trafficking victims as they anticipated. Eventually Ihope toexplainwhat I think went wrongso we can better prepare for the onslaught ofproposed Section 230 amendments that are coming. A short linkwrap: * TechFreedom[2]:Senate Passes Hybrid SESTA Bill, Despite Constitutional ...ckfiring Concerns: 'This is a new low for CongressThe process that led to this point was appalling' * Open Technology Institute[3]:Congress Erred in Passage of FOSTA, Threatening the Internet and Trafficking Victims: 'Though Congress' intentions are good, its methods are harmful' * NPR All Things Considered[4]:Section 230: A Key Legal Shield For Facebook, Google Is About To Change * Mike Godwin[5]:The Roots of Section 230 Show Why We Shouldn't Abandon Intermediary Liability Protection * AEIdeas[6]:Should Big Tech be held more liable for the content on their platforms?</p><p> An AEIdeas online symposium * Congressional Research Service[7]: Ex Post Facto Implications of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (H.R. 1865). We may have more to say about this. For now, note thatTechFreedom disagrees[8]. My apologies, I cannot bring myself to link to the gloating posts from the people who hate Google/Facebook, Section 230, or the Internet generally. It's open season on Section 230, and every victim's advocacy group is gearing up. Section 230had a good run while it lasted.

Thanks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Nobody voted for Anthony Fauci, but somehow he wound up in control of the country. All of that power has gone to his head. Now, he is trying to cancel the NFL. Barstool's Dave Portnoy joins us straight ahead to assess that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, the stepmother of former Atlanta Police Officer Garrett Rolfe was fired from her job for being his stepmother. You first heard about it on this show last night. New developments on that story. We'll bring them to you in just a moment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first tonight, good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>You can be forgiven if the events of the last month caught you by surprise. You didn't expect them. You'd become used to dismissing the American left out of hand as a joke because they are. Since the day Donald Trump was inaugurated, the Democratic Party has been helplessly disorganized and totally ineffective as a political party.</p><p>They wasted years chasing invisible Russian agents and then making weird and unintelligible sounds about something called Ukraine. It's still not clear what they meant by that.</p><p>Their entire political strategy was bizarre, and in the end, it was counterproductive. It hurt them with voters. They went down in the polls.</p><p>Only buffoons do that in politics. These people couldn't organize your kid's birthday party. They didn't make their beds this morning. And yet suddenly, out of nowhere, they roared back and took over the country.</p><p>They did it in less time than it takes most people to go on spring vacation. What happened? How did they do that? Well, it's simple. Nobody stopped them. There was no opposition to their power grab.</p><p>The other side surrendered on day one without a fight. The rest of us watched all of this with our jaws hanging open in shock. It was the opposite of what we expected.</p><p>Millions of people regularly vote for the Republican Party, precisely because they would like someone to protect this country from the crazed ideologues who seek to destroy. There are many of them, we are watching them on television now.</p><p>There's not really another reason to vote Republican, unless you happen to be one of those rare people who wants more pointless foreign wars and enjoys sucking up to banks. Most people don't.</p><p>You vote for Republicans to protect you from this, but when the moment of crisis came, Republicans ran away. Major American cities were looted and burned on television. Citizens were beaten and murdered. Works of public art were destroyed by the score. America's history, those shared experiences that bind us together as a nation was plundered and completely rewritten by illiterate vandals.</p><p>Everywhere as they watched, Americans were afraid -- afraid not simply for their safety, but afraid for their jobs, their reputations, afraid for their families.</p><p>Many Americans were fired abruptly in the middle of a severe recession, doomed to ruin for nothing: for saying the wrong thing, looking the wrong way, liking the wrong tweet. That happened. It's happening now.</p><p>Some of the accused were so terrified they denounced their own families -- wife, brother, daughter. In the end, they were destroyed anyway, because that's what happens in purges. You're destroyed anyway.</p><p>Most Americans assume they would never live to see a moment like this. But they have, it's still going on, and the question that hangs in the air is, where are our protectors?</p><p>At the height of the riots, the President of the Heritage Foundation, that's the nation's single largest conservative think tank, it has consumed billions of donor dollars. The President of Heritage wrote an op-ed accusing America of being irredeemably racist.</p><p>Her name is Kay Coles James, you've probably have sent her money. As American burned, Kay Coles, President of the Heritage Foundation piled on, and she wasn't alone in that. So many on the right did exactly the same thing.</p><p>Meanwhile, they did nothing. They didn't lift a finger to help the people they had promised, they had pledged to protect -- their voters and their donors. Instead, they did everything possible to accommodate the demands of the people tormenting them, the rioters and the people who back the rioters.</p><p>Congressional Republicans decided to make reining in law enforcement their top legislative priority. They blamed the cops. They didn't blame the rioters, they blamed the cops.</p><p>Then Republicans bragged about springing more criminals from jail. The last thing we needed.</p><p>In the State of Iowa, the Republican Governor announced that she was giving felons the vote by Executive Order, not even waiting for the election, just doing it, signing it.</p><p>Meanwhile, almost everywhere, ordinary Americans came under attack for the color of their skin, acts of actual racism where people are being hurt for their race, something they can't control, something they were born with.</p><p>And yet, no Republicans rose to defend them. Republicans refused even to defend the principle of equality under the law, the foundation of this country, the most important thing we have -- not defended.</p><p>Really in the end, the only people who gained anything in the revolution were the ones waging it. Our leaders very much including our Republican leader, shamefully were focused on meeting their demands.</p><p>So, what should we conclude from what we just saw? The message unfortunately, could not be clearer. Voting is for fools. You vote, you put these people into office with your votes, and in return, they patronize you. And when it matters, they abandon you. They have contempt for you. You know they do, you can smell it, it's obvious.</p><p>Voting doesn't work. But when you riot, and you burn things, and you hurt people, you get a very different response. When you do those things, our leaders snap to attention. They tiptoe around your feelings as Republicans are. They give you what you want, as Republicans are. Rioting works.</p><p>That's the message they're sending. Think about that. It is the most dangerous possible message you can send, because it guarantees more violence.</p><p>You've got to wonder how all of this would have played out if Barack Obama was still President. Let's say it was the summer of 2011, right before Obama's reelection campaign started in earnest.</p><p>Imagine if at that politically critical moment, violent mobs of Mitt Romney supporters began looting and burning major American cities, screaming racist slogans as they did. Hard to imagine, but try.</p><p>Imagine if the Romney mob then defaced and tore down statues of Martin Luther King in public parks. Imagine if every street sign in America, identifying a Martin Luther King Boulevard was suddenly ripped to the ground and defaced with graffiti.</p><p>Most Americans would find that appalling and disgusting. We certainly would.</p><p>But let's say the mob kept doing it because nobody stopped them. Imagine if the people who planned to vote for Barack Obama in the fall knew they couldn't admit that in public. If citizens wearing Obama hats were physically assaulted, punched in the face, thrown to the sidewalk and kicked.</p><p>Imagine if anyone who spoke out against the mobs or showed support for Obama's campaign was censored or deplatformed by tech monopolies that operated at the pleasure of Federal regulators. Imagine if those same monopolies censored President Obama himself.</p><p>So ask yourself, sincerely, if all of that happened, how do you think Barack Obama would have responded? By tweeting angry things? By effectively apologizing to the mob and meeting their demands for quote, \"reform\" and then declaring a new national holiday at their request? Probably not.</p><p>It's hard to imagine Barack Obama doing that. It's hard to imagine complaining that as President of the United States he didn't have the power to stop political violence or preserve the integrity of an election or protect free speech or public art or the nation's history itself. No, that would not happen.</p><p>Instead, within about 10 minutes, you would see the Obama Justice Department indict every single person involved on Federal conspiracy and Civil Rights charges. You would watch his SEAL Team 6 reclaimed downtown Seattle. You'd see airborne units drop from the sky into Atlanta, Minneapolis and Portland. You would see whatever it took to stop the chaos. That revolution would not last long.</p><p>Say what you will about Barack Obama and we do, but he never doubted he had the constitutional authority to act and he did act. Obama knew a threat when he saw one.</p><p>Our Republican leaders don't believe they have the authority. They don't believe they're legitimate. They don't see the threat. They don't want to see the threat because they know they can't face the mob. They know they're too weak, and so they offer trinkets and hope the mob will go away, but it won't. Mobs can't be sated.</p><p>We thought Republicans understood that. That's why we supported them. But crisis has revealed the truth. Now we know who they are. It could not be clearer and now it's time to find new leaders.</p><p>Ned Ryun is the founder and CEO of American Majority and author of the book, \"Restoring Our Republic.\" He joins us tonight. Ned, I've got to say, it physically pains me to write those paragraphs about Barack Obama. I only did because I think it's true. I think Obama was the worst President in American history.</p><p>But I can't imagine how the Republican Party can reward rioting, which is what they are doing -- the Democrats, needless to say inspired the rioting. I'm not letting them off the hook, but the Republican Party should be defending us isn't rewarding it. What are we watching?</p><p>NED RYUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: We're watching the fact that it's really becoming clear that the base -- the priorities of the base and the Constitution really aren't the priority of the Republican leaders of Conservative Inc.</p><p>I tell people, actions authenticate a belief system and think about it, you've got Black Lives Matter. They are avowed Marxists. They want to destroy capitalism. They want to destroy the western nuclear family.</p><p>For them, politics is a religion. They want to perfect humanity through their belief system through politics, and they are validating their beliefs by their current actions right now.</p><p>Republicans and conservatives go to D.C. because they want to have a good career and get a check.</p><p>And I tell people that what you're seeing right now is you cannot defeat basically religious zealots hell bent on the destruction of the American Republic with a bunch of careers looking for the next paycheck. And to make my point even further, Tucker, the actions of Mitch McConnell, of Kay James validate my point. They slander us. They sell us out, and they are doing it because they seek money and power.</p><p>If you don't believe me, think about the process and how this works. Republican seek to raise money from their corporate cronies to get reelected to make them happy. They do all kinds of policy issues to get the next reelection check.</p><p>Heritage raises money to get the next building, to get the next marble bathroom and you realize what they're doing is building even more sinecures for ineffective people.</p><p>The whole point for them was money and power not to advance the base and not to advance our priorities.</p><p>CARLSON: It leaves the rest of us in a very tough spot, because obviously you're not going to support what we're watching on television, which really is a political action sponsored by the Democratic Party. Let's not lie about it. This is an election strategy. It's political violence and the democrats are behind it.</p><p>So, you're not going to vote for that. So the Republicans are ineffective because they know they can be because if you're a normal person, you have no choice.</p><p>RYUN: Well, that's the point. They've been blackmailing us. I mean, it really does feel like blackmail. What are you going to do? Vote for them. Well, you have to vote for us and you have to actually fall in line with us.</p><p>Of course, we're going to sell you out. We're going to abuse you. We're going to slander you. But this is the whole point why Donald Trump was elected, Tucker. He was elected as an outsider to come represent the American people, to represent Americanism, not republicanism, not corporatism, and we elected him to punch back, to counterpunch, to punch even harder.</p><p>And I would tell him, you were elected for a reason you were elected as a reaction to what we're seeing playing out. Don't hold your punches. Don't listen to those voices that are telling you to moderate your views, punch even harder.</p><p>Because I'm convinced, Tucker, nothing less than the American Republic is at stake. This is a tipping point for us and the fight is very real. If we don't win -- if we don't win this fall, I don't know what the future looks like for us.</p><p>CARLSON: I think a lot of people feel that way. Ned Ryun, thanks so much for your honesty. I appreciate that.</p><p>RYUN: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, as we've said many times because it's the truest thing we've ever said, if you want more riots and more violence, then reward them as our leaders are.</p><p>In Portland, Oregon last night, rioters wrapped an American flag around the George Washington statue, then lift the flag on fire and pulled the statue to the ground. They destroyed it. George Washington, the founder of the country.</p><p>Today, officials in Portland announced that the statue which has stood there for nearly a century will not go back up.</p><p>In Seattle, Antifa demonstrators drove the police from a precinct building and created their own autonomous area. Consequences so far. Zero.</p><p>Jason Rantz has been tracking developments in downtown Seattle for us. He has been our CHOP correspondent all week. We're happy to have him back on tonight. Jason, what's the latest?</p><p>JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: The latest is the mood on the ground has changed considerably. It does seem like it's gotten a lot more dangerous since this new leadership started to take hold and a woman who has spoken up saying that they will have their demands met by any means necessary.</p><p>We had in the last 24 hours or so a man with a machete wandering around Cal Anderson Park, which by the way, is now restricted between the time of 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. to black Seattleites only. So they will not allow anybody else on the on the grounds until after 8:00 p.m.</p><p>The tents that have been set up behind us --</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sorry, may I pause you there? So, in downtown Seattle there is a racially segregated park. Is the City of Seattle allowing this?</p><p>RANTZ: The City of Seattle is allowing everything right now that's happening. Right now, this entire zone, no matter what the SPD is telling you and the Chief of Police is claiming that there's no such thing as a no cops zone. That is a hundred percent incorrect and the people who actually live, the people who live and pay rent in this area, they are now starting to speak up, some of them anonymously, some of them putting their name to it.</p><p>Because they're saying, look, what you guys don't seem to understand is after hours, things get very dangerous.</p><p>There was a local security company out here, Iconic Global that ended up finding an AK-47 and fully loaded magazine stashed in some shrubs very close to CHOP, and right now, the media is kind of getting pushed out certainly in certain spots in the back again of this -- of the tense of Cal Anderson Park. People are being told you can't film here. We're not allowing it. It's no longer a public park, and they are forcing people to actually erase any video or photographs that they're taking.</p><p>CARLSON: That's shocking. Does the city have -- does the most ineffective mayor in America, Jenny Durkan, a narcissist -- have any plans on shutting this down before there's bloodshed?</p><p>RANTZ: As of right now, there are no plans that anyone is aware of. They tried to open some of lanes for traffic, and that right now is kind of tenuous, but it's hanging out there.</p><p>But unfortunately, there's no plans that seems right now to repopulate the East Precinct, this police station with a number of staff members who can actually adequately police this very large neighborhood of Seattle.</p><p>And, again, people are getting more and more concerned with their personal safety. Some of them have said they're just moving into hotels for the time being.</p><p>CARLSON: Unbelievable. Be careful. Jason Rantz, good to see you.</p><p>RANTZ: Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: So much bad news. Here's the good news. Sports. Sports are apolitical. They're meritocratic. We've got football coming up in the fall. Oh, but wait, Dr. Fauci who appears to believe he is in charge of the country says we can't have football this fall.</p><p>How should we respond? Dave Portnoy joins us after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Probably no single American in history has accumulated more power without being elected than Dr. Tony Fauci. Most people have never heard of him four months ago, now, he runs the country. How has he used that power?</p><p>Well, often to promote wild speculation, some of it untrue, that is nevertheless taken as gospel by millions of fearful Americans.</p><p>At one point, Fauci told us that coronavirus was so deadly we should never shake hands again. Oops. There goes one of the oldest traditions known to man, but Fauci also endorsed breaking lockdowns to have sex with strangers you meet online. Okay.</p><p>This week, Dr. Fauci warned that coronavirus is so dangerous that the entire NFL season may have to be canceled. Dave Portnoy did not vote for Anthony Fauci. He did, however, found Barstool Sports, and we're happy to have him on tonight to assess the reign of President Fauci.</p><p>Dave, do you think that our unelected monarch, Tony Fauci is making the right decision by destroying America's most popular sport?</p><p>DAVE PORTNOY, FOUNDER, BARSTOOL SPORTS: Well, the good news is, I don't think he has any actual influence on it, and in a rare situation, the only man who thinks he was elected without being elected by the American people more than him, Roger Goodell.</p><p>I think he would infect his own family with corona before canceling the NFL season. You know, I don't -- they're going to play the NFL. Why Fauci feels like he has the right to say they're not. He can certainly say, you know, maybe dangerous, but the way he phrased it, it was like he was the end all be all on that.</p><p>I would actually be very curious to see if he tried to, you know, absolutely install that regime -- whereas the Roger Goodell regime is --and you know, all hell would break loose in that case.</p><p>CARLSON: So I didn't hear a single thing that you said after you complimented Roger Goodell because I never thought I would live to hear that. Was it hard for those words to form on your tongue?</p><p>PORTNOY: Well, it wasn't exactly a compliment. I did say he would infect his own family with corona if it meant, you know, they get to play the NFL season, so they're going to play the NFL. Roger Goodell does not care about safety or anything like that. This could be, you know, the greatest pandemic of all time, he is playing.</p><p>Again why Fauci thought he had the right to act like he was the decision maker? I have no idea.</p><p>CARLSON: What is this going to do to attendance at the games?</p><p>PORTNOY: You know, I think we're seeing right now, the American people clearly have COVID fatigue, whether that's right or wrong, people are showing up in droves to casinos, to bars.</p><p>If you let people go to the game, they're going to go. The American people -- humans in general -- are social creatures. So, they'll show up. The only way they won't is that we physically are told we can't go, not allowed in. But if you let people go, they're willing to risk it. And by the way, I think that should be each individual's choice,</p><p>CARLSON: Of course. So, we're hearing yesterday that it is possible, stadiums will take the temperature, or somehow test every person with a ticket trying to get in. What would that look like, do you think?</p><p>PORTNOY: Those would probably be the longest lines in the history of lines. I mean, imagine getting in a bar when you have a slow bouncer with your ID. Imagine them actually taking every single person's test.</p><p>I went to Michigan, it takes an hour and a half to get into that stadium anyways. So impracticality, it sounds, all right, if you can do it. How you can actually make this work? I mean, you're going to have to get to the game nine hours early. You're going to have more problems with people congregating waiting to get in than actually being in.</p><p>CARLSON: So one of the effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns, the quarantines is that people look very different from the way they did four months ago.</p><p>A lot of people have gained weight. You haven't obviously, but you have grown a very, very bushy beard. Are you going to keep it?</p><p>PORTNOY: Well, Tucker, I haven't had a haircut in three and a half months. The results are very mixed. I'm having some of the gentle nature, the females -- some say they like the curls, some don't.</p><p>My barbershop has not opened yet. So I'm very in between. I may let the public decide, and again, I say public, I only care about the female gender and let them tell me what they think about it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Do you have any sense from your informal polling on the question what the reaction is?</p><p>PORTNOY: I think is about 60 for the light Corona day. I've got a brilliant tan. I look like I just got washed into shore Tom Hanks' style from \"Castaway.\"</p><p>It's a tough vote right now. I'm not going to lie. It can go either way, depending on who you talk to.</p><p>CARLSON: Dave Portnoy talking to his soccer ball. Great to see you tonight, Dave.</p><p>PORTNOY: Take care.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>PORTNOY: Bye.</p><p>CARLSON: Big Tech has finally decided to censor the President directly. So of course you're not going to feel any restraint with other targets. In fact, Twitter and YouTube are taking aim at this show. Yes, details ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a week ago, our producers whipped up a mock tourism ad for CHOP, then still known as CHAZ, the newest nation in the world in Seattle. You might remember it, here's a portion of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: It's the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone located within beautiful downtown Seattle. It's the anarchist utopia you never knew you needed.</p><p>Not wild about cops. Good news because there are none.</p><p>Mask men with guns will keep you safe and sound throughout your stay.</p><p>Check out these state of the art Porta-Potties.</p><p>We'll see you soon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I want to apologize if you found what you just saw hateful, disgusting, if you were traumatized by watching it. Twitter is very concerned you might be.</p><p>When we posted that fake ad on Twitter, Twitter flagged it as quote, \"potentially sensitive content.\" And then they hid it from view. What were they saying? They were saying beware. Keep your kids from watching this.</p><p>What's the justification for warning people of that? We have no idea. Probably that it's edited video, of course, they've never flagged a clip from \"The Onion\" or \"The Daily Show,\" obviously, you know why.</p><p>Meanwhile, our half hour long response to nationwide Black Lives Matter riots has a warning now on YouTube. It says this, quote, \"The following content has been identified by the YouTube community (whatever that is) as inappropriate or offensive to some audiences.\"</p><p>By offensive they mean that the left doesn't like it and that is the new standard and there's only one response under that standard. Silence the person who disagrees with you.</p><p>That's why censorship is now everywhere. It's where the tech companies started censoring the President. That's why they're getting more and more aggressive in silencing you.</p><p>Today it's an offensive content label, soon you know what's going to happen. It'll be erased. It's digital. It's not hard to erase it. We will never give in, obviously, but the left's goal is to make dissent visible and therefore irrelevant.</p><p>Meanwhile, these same tech companies make it very easy to for 12-year-olds to watch hardcore pornography. They have no problem with that at all.</p><p>But political views they disagree with no. \"Gone with the Wind\" too scary. It tells you everything about what they care about and who they are.</p><p>All of us understands with no government at all, the strong prey on the weak with impunity. Laws exist to protect the weak, and that ultimately is why we pay taxes, to allow the government to protect the weak from those who might harm them.</p><p>So what happens when government decides to stop protecting its citizens? In the past month, many have had to confront that question. On May 30th, riots ripped through downtown Charleston, South Carolina. And to their horror, many citizens there discovered, no one came to help.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just called it earlier, but it's gotten worse. The rioters, they broke -- they broke into the restaurant and they're killing all the money, the alcohol, removing all of the -- and 30 employees are stuck in the courtyard and they're barricading the doors and they're trying to break in.</p><p>I've called 15 minutes ago and there's still no cops and these 30 people that are in danger.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay, and say there are people throwing stuff at the windows?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There are people out screaming. They are throwing things through windows. They're assaulting people, like, where are the freaking police?</p><p>Why are they not stopping them?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Where are the freaking police? Yes, imagine if you had to ask that question to a 911 dispatcher.</p><p>Ken Schneider owns a wine bar in Charleston. It was attacked. He called police repeatedly and received no assistance. Meanwhile, his business was destroyed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What's the name of the business?</p><p>KEN SCHNEIDER, BUSINESS OWNER, CHARLESTON: Uncork Charleston. My staff and guests were running for their lives while the police cowered at King and Calhoun and still haven't moved and left the entire city unattended. People in harm's way. Businesses destroyed.</p><p>Are you guys ever going to show up tonight?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Okay, sir, we do have calls in for this. The Charleston Police Department has officers that are responding, okay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Ken Schneider joins us now. Ken, thanks so much for coming out. There is something about your call that made me emotional as I listened to it. It was -- it was primal. I think every person who heard it could picture themselves in your position. What was it like?</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Well, thanks for having me. I will also say that the first caller from -- I believe she was from the Macintosh. It was the first 911 call.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And, you know, I kind of get a little emotional and teary eyed because I lived it. Not only did I live it, my son was literally the last line of defense. He had just dragged two customers off the street to protect them and the first brick came through the window and shattered shards of glass on him.</p><p>I left about an hour before it started because the street, King Street was reasonably quiet, because a lot of people stayed away because they knew there were protests going on in Marion Square, which is our Central Park.</p><p>And I got home and my staff started calling. It first started with the doorman who said, Ken, I heard from the -- you know, on the street that there might be an 11 o'clock curfew.</p><p>So, I call the nonemergency line first, to which they said yes, there is. And I said, well, what does that mean? Do I have to have my guests leave? Do I have to have my staff leave? Does it mean at 11 o'clock, they have to leave and their quote was, \"We don't know.\"</p><p>So I thank them and I hung up, and I go up to my office and I start watching the cameras, and I start watching the scene unfold and it's hard to think about now because again, my son was there. My staff was there, the guests were there.</p><p>And you know, I'm getting staff members calling me, telling me to call 911. Nothing. Then there's gunshots out on the street. And this is Charleston, this is not a town where this stuff ever happens.</p><p>I mean, we made it through the Scott murder. We made it through Mother Emanuel, which yesterday was the Fifth Anniversary. And the people of Charleston have always come together and when this happened, it was frightening. It was devastating.</p><p>You know, my business is being rebuilt. But the bottom line was, you know, we had guests and employees basically scared for their lives and they should have been because what was going on -- and nobody came.</p><p>You know, I'm 55 years old, in my life, I never would have thought no one came and I'm going to say Tucker, that I don't hold anything against the police because they were following orders. I hold it against the leadership of the city, against Mayor Tecklenburg. Total lack of leadership, lack of planning, lack of communication. No one had any warning.</p><p>You know, no one said no one is not going to come. It was almost as if when you call 911 the final time, I felt like I was calling a restaurant for a reservation. Is there anything else you'd like to tell us? Would you like a window seat?</p><p>You know, it was so nonchalant and it's just a terrible feeling to know that you know, you live in a place where when you know what hits the fan if no one is going to show up to help you. And I'm sorry, go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: No, I'm listening mesmerized. Just Charleston is such a wonderful place. It's just hard to believe that your city would allow this, that your mayor would be this negligent, would care so little that the city would allow this.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Yes, I mean, the lack of leadership, creativity, planning -- all of it. It just goes into it. I started sending him e-mails and I have his e-mail address that I know he responds to because he has in the past -- e- mails to him on Saturday night, the 30th of May when this happened, saying, how can you let this go on? Your lack of leadership is appalling. And you know nothing.</p><p>Even to this day, the outreach to the community hasn't been there. We've been boarded up. We're getting close to opening. I begged and borrowed and really pulled a lot of cards to have people help rebuild my place because, you know, we survived COVID. I'm not going to let this take us down, but --</p><p>CARLSON: And you didn't even do anything wrong. It's not like you assaulted anyone. You're a completely innocent bystander.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Ken Schneider. I really am rooting for you. I know our viewers are, too. I'm sorry about that. And I and I hope you get new leadership soon. Great to see you tonight.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Thank you. Thanks for your time.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, in some cities as in Charleston, South Carolina, the police don't show up so the criminals run wild. In other cities like Atlanta, police officers are being persecuted, facing a death penalty offense for doing their job -- trying to protect the public.</p><p>We will talk to the lawyer for Atlanta policeman Garrett Rolfe, who as we said is facing the death penalty tonight. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well repeatedly over the past decade in this country, criminal suspects have grabbed Tasers from police officers off of their belts or out of their hands and then whipped around and tried to shoot the cops with them.</p><p>For doing that, suspects repeatedly have been shot; in some cases shot to death. Repeatedly, the officers who shot them have been cleared for obvious reasons. Tasers are potentially deadly weapons. We allow police officers to defend themselves in the public when criminals try to kill them.</p><p>But all of that changed this week because the mob descended on Atlanta and ordered the authorities there to change the rules and to take a scalp. Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe is facing the death penalty for murder after he shot and killed a man called Rayshard Brooks. Why did he do that? Because Rayshard Brooks grabbed his Taser during a routine DUI arrest after knocking him to the ground and tried to shoot him with it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rolfe's stepmother was just fired from her job at a place -- get a pen -- called Equity Prime Mortgage. She was told quote, \"We have to terminate a relationship with you.\" Why? Because she was the stepmother of someone who was unpopular.</p><p>Lance Lorusso is Officer Rolfe's attorney and he joins us tonight. We're happy to have him on. Mr. Lorusso, thank you so much for coming on. So first, I want to get to the story of Melissa Rolfe, the stepmother who was not involved in any kind of cheating, who was a private citizen. She was an HR Director at this mortgage brokerage.</p><p>And she was -- tell me if I'm getting this right, she was assured by her employer who I think his name is Eddie Perez, that she can -- that the company supported her. Everything was totally fine. And then they whipped around and fired her. Why?</p><p>LANCE LORUSSO, ATTORNEY FOR GARRETT ROLFE: That is my understanding. All we've heard is that there was some social media post they were concerned about, we've not seen the post and obviously, we're vigorously looking into this to try to find out what changed number one, and what was the basis for her termination.</p><p>CARLSON: What do you mean social media? So, they issued a statement suggesting that she had written something racist. I mean, that was the suggestion. They attacked her as a bigot.</p><p>My understanding is that the post was defending her son and other police officers. Do you know differently?</p><p>LORUSSO: We have not seen what the post is and it is amazing to me and unconscionable that she would be terminated and not be told why.</p><p>And especially in an environment like this where her and her family are going through so much, you would think there would at least be the courtesy and decency of an explanation if there was such a post that was offensive.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I disagree. There's nothing courteous or decent about firing someone for something she didn't do. They fired her because her stepson got arrested and it's disgusting. And I hope that -- I hope that our viewers understand that.</p><p>Let me ask you, it seems clear that the DA in the case, in the Rolfe case, has a lot of motive to overcharge. So, he is being investigated for corruption. He is up for reelection. Can he remain the prosecutor in this case, do you think?</p><p>LORUSSA: You know that's going to have to be determined by court to see if he can still remain impartial and whether his office can remain impartial. Georgia does have a procedure and it happens all the time where there's an issue raised or a prosecutor voluntarily seeks a -- conflict prosecutor is what it's called from the DA office.</p><p>So that is what his criminal defense counsel we'll be working on, on a regular basis going forward. Obviously, there's a great deal in this case that has to be looked at. But I think anytime you have a rush to judgment, people get concerned.</p><p>When you have an investigation that takes place while a third party, the G.B.I. has been asked to come in by the Atlanta Police, and their investigation is only days old, and charges are announced that should cause everybody some pause.</p><p>Nothing ever benefited from a quick investigation.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you're quite the master of understatement, aren't you? We should be concerned. I'll just be blunt. I'm outraged. It's really clear that this is a violation of recent precedent.</p><p>I mean, the prosecutor himself just said that using a Taser against a cop is considered a deadly weapon, it is deadly force. So, by that standard, this whole prosecution is like -- is insane or am I missing something?</p><p>LORUSSO: No, you're not missing anything, and the other problem with a Taser is, it is an incapacitating weapon. So when an officer uses a Taser in the course of a lawful arrest, then it could incapacitate the person for a period of five seconds so they can put the handcuffs on. They're taught target areas. They're taught no target areas. They're taught how to care for a person afterwards.</p><p>A Taser in the hands of somebody, first of all, who is untrained or using it against a law enforcement officer can incapacitate the officer, can shoot them in the face, can blind them and then incapacitate them taking their weapon.</p><p>So, that is the reason why it is so serious when somebody takes a weapon who is untrained and uses it against a law enforcement officer.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. No, it all makes sense. One last quick factual question. Stacy Abrams claimed the other day -- the demagogue who may be Joe Biden's Vice President -- claimed that the officer, Officer Rolfe knew the suspect did not have a firearm. Is that true?</p><p>LORUSSO: You know, there has been so much that has been said about that. We have people misquoting exactly what's in the video and you can see it. The amount of time something took place, people's relationships to each other and as far as I know, I've seen that video several times, and I don't remember seeing Stacy Abrams there.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I know. Good point. Thanks so much for joining us tonight.</p><p>LORUSSO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: If family ever deserved punishment, you would think, punishment that might sap their considerable fortunes, the Sackler family, their painkiller, OxyContin kicked off the opioid epidemic which has killed so many Americans -- whole communities.</p><p>Now the family is using Bankruptcy Court to avoid paying up. Not enough has been written about this. We will shine some light on it after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Add to the long and growing list of real issues our leaders seem to care nothing about, the opioid epidemic over the last 20 years has taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans, hundreds of thousands. It has killed far more than the coronavirus has or will, thanks to this year's lockdowns, 2020, could be the deadliest year yet for drug ODs in America. Many people who die are young people with promising futures.</p><p>Nobody deserves more blame for all of this than the Sackler family, they're the owners of a company called Purdue Pharma.</p><p>For years, the Sacklers made billions promoting the painkiller, OxyContin. They knew how addictive it was, they hid that fact. They lied.</p><p>The family could lose its fortune, an estimated $14 billion, but instead, they appear to be exploiting American Bankruptcy Courts to save almost all of it.</p><p>Gerald Posner is maybe the best known and most thorough investigative journalist in this country. There aren't many left. He's author of the book \"Pharma\" and we're happy to have him tonight.</p><p>Joe, thanks so much for coming on. So --</p><p>GERALD POSNER, AUTHOR: Great to be with you.</p><p>CARLSON: First of all, thank you for writing this book. It is a subject that has been basically ignored by the press, and so I'm glad that you didn't ignore it.</p><p>The Sacklers, we know from documents, we're aware to some extent of what was going on, how can they escape punishment? How could this be happening?</p><p>POSNER: It's absolutely infuriating, Tucker. As a matter of fact, you know, the Sacklers and Purdue, the company responsible for their blockbuster OxyContin, they already pleaded guilty, the company did back in 2007 to felonies for misbranding the drug and three of their executives also pled guilty and what did they do? What happens every time in the pharmaceutical business, they pay big fines, $600 million. It's the cost of doing business.</p><p>OxyContin content brought in $35 billion in revenue from the time it went on sale in 1996, and after they pled guilty in 2007, the company went on with the same behavior except on steroids and that's why as you said in your lead in, in 2015, \"Forbes\" made them -- put them on as one of the richest families in America at $14 billion.</p><p>This is a company that normally takes a high profile. They've got their names in six foot granted letters, as you know, on Columbia and Yale and Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian. And yet now, they're very low key, because they may be able to get away with a great miscarriage of justice in the Bankruptcy Court.</p><p>And you think, bankruptcy? How is it possible that a company with $14 billion, a family is in bankruptcy? Well, they aren't. Their company is.</p><p>Purdue filed last September, and they did a very clever thing. They went to the Bankruptcy Judge and said, oh, by the way, we have over 2,000 lawsuits against us as individual directors, eight family members and Purdue is sued. Why don't you give a stay of all the litigation against us right here and we'll cooperate in court and come up with a settlement.</p><p>They've offered $3 billion and you know what? They might be able to pull it off because no one is paying attention to it. And if they do, they will be able to leave with billions of dollars of their OxyContin profits. The victims will be badly served. There will be no justice in this case, no final report, no account of responsibility from the Sacklers, and that's why what we need is an independent examiner to be appointed in the bankruptcy case, but I don't see any movement for it.</p><p>CARLSON: Very quickly. Can the State Attorneys General do anything about this?</p><p>POSNER: Their hands are tied by the Bankruptcy Court, which is remarkable. They had sued the Sacklers and here they are, all of a sudden, being told to go through the bankruptcy system, which is about reaching settlements for big companies not about reaching justice, unfortunately.</p><p>And remember, this is a family, as I discovered in the book, they were members of the Communist Party. The three brothers who bought Purdue in 1952, card carrying members of the Communist Party in the 40s and 50s.</p><p>Today, they're the ultimate example of capitalism gone awry with $14 billion of money earned off of one single drug, which, as you said, has killed hundreds of thousands of people. They're the poster child for the opioid epidemic, and how is it possible that they may be able to pull up this miscarriage of justice, it's a shame to the Justice Department and to what's happening in this country.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you for caring enough to write this book. Too few have. Mr. Posner --</p><p>POSNER: Thank you for being the only host to talk about this subject. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's awful. It's absolutely awful. But we hope you have a great weekend nevertheless. We will see you Monday. Sean Hannity right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020061901cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605R-J5R1-DXH2-621B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6993\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 19, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Police</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Race Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Seattle</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sports</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health And Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rayshard Brooks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Litigation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Atlanta</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>OxyContin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Big Tech</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Censorship</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pharmaceutical Industry</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Republicans warn  that time is running out for Nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser to testify.   President Trump defending his pick to the Supreme Court and hopeful that  Christine Blasey Ford will testify.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I really want to see her, I  really would want to see what she has to say.  But I want to give it all  the time they need if she shows up that would be wonderful.  If she doesn't  show up, that would be unfortunate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have the latest coming up.  And we are watching these markets  because the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are oh, so close to new all-time highs.  On  the Dow, all the futures are up 94-point gain on the Dow futures at the  moment.  26,616 and change is the old record set for the blue chips January  26th of this year.  We will be watching that.  This after a bit of a mixed  session yesterday, the Dow and S&amp;P moving to plus side.</p><p>The NASDAQ composite dipping lower.  Tech stocks taken a bit of a bruising  there.  Checking the global market action over in Europe, we have buying  across the board in England, France, and Germany and every market in Asia  overnight up except the Shanghai down just fractionally.  </p><p>Florence fallout.  Devastating flooding in the Carolinas could wreak havoc  on the region for years.  And the concerns go well beyond infrastructure.   We take a closer look at the health hazards with Health and Human Services  Secretary Alex Azar later this hour.</p><p>Alibaba backtracks.  Jack Ma, the founder says his company is pledged to  create one million jobs in America is off the table.  He's blaming the  trade dispute that the U.S. is having with China, the fallout ahead.</p><p>On the block, the battle for Sky News will go to auction.  We have the  details on how this deal's fate could be sealed.  All that and so much more  coming up this morning, former state department spokesman, host of \"BENSON &amp; HARF\" on Fox News Radio, Maria Harf.  Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner  Mike Murphy and Forbes Media Chairman and former Republican presidential  candidate, Steve Forbes.</p><p>It's been a pleasure so far to spend this morning with you.  , it has been  a pleasure so far, to spend this morning with you.  And just real quick,  Steve, because I know you love talking taxes, the corporate tax cut is  paying for itself, how about that.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  And Steve Moore had an article on  that just a few hours ago, 24 hours ago.  Yes.  When you get off of  people's tax, the economy prospers.  And the assets of the nation go up as  well as the incomes.  And, so for the first time in a long time not only do  we have job shortages but also companies are getting in the business that  the government can never do, job training.</p><p>That's the best, Corporate America is the best job trainer, you're starting  to see that kick in, and so it's nice to have the problem, labor shortages,  wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So I love to see you smile.  That's why I asked you that  question, Steve.  We've got a lot --  </p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.  I always smile.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Thank you.  Steve Forbes also, the first thing you always  ask about my dogs, so thank you for that.  To our top story this hour,  President Trump hitting the campaign trail.  The President will hold a  rally in Las Vegas tonight as the midterm elections loom.  The GOP pushes  ahead -- full steam ahead on confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme  Court.  Blake Burman is joining us with the very latest from the White  House.  Good morning, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Dagen.  Good morning to you as well.  Republicans who control the Senate  Judiciary Committee have given Christine Blasey Ford an ultimatum.  Let us  know by tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m.  Friday at 10:00 a.m. if you will  testify before that committee on Monday, or not.  Chuck Grassley, the top  Republican who runs that committee says he is giving Ford four different  options on how to make that possible.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Where  I'm focused right now is doing everything that we can to make Dr. Ford  comfortable with coming before our committee either in an open session or  closed session or a public or a private interviews.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  The Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh who Ford says sexually  assaulted her at a party during their high school years denies that  allegation and says he is ready to head back to the Hill Monday.  But  Ford's attorney said last night in a statement that timeline is hurried,  \"the committee stated plans to move forward with a hearing that has only  two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation.\"</p><p>They go on to write, the rush to a hearing is unnecessary and contrary to  the committee discovering the truth.  Ford's attorneys have also called for  law enforcement investigation before she would testify, a position that  Democrats support as well.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (R), NEW YORK:  I think staying there testify on  Monday, or not be heard I think it is fairly outrageous.  And what's really  shocking to me that is that there is a normal process for a Supreme Court  justice nomination, and it starts with an FBI background check.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Dagen, President Trump continues to stand by his FBI -- his  Supreme Court nominee rather.  The President said yesterday that if Ford  were to testify up the Hill, that would be \"wonderful.\"  If not, he  described that as \"unfortunate.\"  As for the President know official public  events on his schedule today, he will thought head later today to Las Vegas  for a campaign rally there tonight.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  Blake Burman at the White House for us.  And let's  turner to the political impact of this and those midterm elections.  47  days away in an increasingly partisan season.  My next guest is launching a  super PAC to support President Trump's agenda in the face of escalating  liberal backlash.  Here with us now is former presidential candidate Herman  Cain.  Tell us about the initiative in terms of the President's agenda.</p><p>Steve Forbes was talking about some of the results that this country is  already seen, good morning.  </p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Good morning, Dagen.  And  that's what people should focus on.  And that's what we are going to be  focusing on with the super PAC called America Fighting Back.  And people  can help and we need their help at americafighting backpack.com or AFB.com.   Here is why we started this.  The liberal media and you know who they are,  they basically report 90 percent negative about this president.</p><p>And about the results that we are getting similar to the ones that Steve  just alluded to.  90 percent negative.  This is -- our objective is simple.   Number one, help maintain control of the United States House and the United  States Senate and to support the President's agenda through 2020.  And I  have often said, you don't have to love the tree to love the fruit.  The  fruit is great.</p><p>But all the liberal media and the Democrats want to focus on, they want to  focus on bringing down the tree.  And so this super PAC America Fighting  Back, is going to fight back against the negativity.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Steve have said this, I will debate policy all day long,  personality not.  What do you have to say to Herman?  </p><p>FORBES:  Well Herman, the Republicans won going to have an agenda, positive  agenda, not just saying the economy is good but how they're going to make  it better.  And, two, the President looks like he is now going to be  focusing on the economy at a great tweet this morning.  The key thing is  set the agenda and not get sidetracked.  The Republicans going to do it and  finally, Herman, persuade the Republicans and get a real tax cut proposal  out there.</p><p>So people have a Christmas present to look forward to if they win.  </p><p>CAIN:  I agree with you one hundred percent, Steve.  And the thing is yes,  this Super PAC along with a lot of other organizations and PACs that are  out there, they are doing a good job of trying to get a positive message  out about the results that this president and this administration that they  are producing.  However, the message is sometimes overwhelmed, and what  sets us apart is that we will have a voice, this voice and a face, this  face to the T.V. ad campaign that we're going to be running.  </p><p>And you're right, it's difficult at times to get all of the Republicans to  get on the same page.  We also hope that this would be a vehicle for them  to help get on the same page and deliver that messages as well as that  Christmas present you talked about which we know is working out fantastic  and they now have momentum behind them as well as actual results based on  what you mentioned that Steve Forbes heard about yesterday.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  -- in blue states there are about 20 Republicans --  representatives in blue states that are vulnerable, they're all getting hit  on assault thing losing to local deductions.  How are you going to counter  that to save these 20 Republicans?  </p><p>CAIN:  Our second tactic is a targeted campaign in those very vulnerable  states.  Remember the Super PAC we're not going to coordinate with them but  we know where these races are close.  And we have technology that will  allow us to target these races so we can then go in and target the voters  in those states to tell them the truth.  All we have to do is tell people  the truth, they will make the right decisions.</p><p>So we are targeting those races in order to try to help out.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Marie has a question for you, Herman. </p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Herman, Marie Harf here, there  is a lot of evidence in polls and anecdotally that the Republican voters  are not that fired up this November.  Democrats are really enthusiastic,  their base is ready to go vote and a lot of stories about Republicans not  believing that they might lose the House, there is a lot of apathy.  It  seems like upon Republicans voters.  How are you going to help tackle that  issue?  </p><p>CAIN:  The thing that I talked about on my show yesterday that's posted at  my Web site, Hermancain.com, Republicans and Conservatives don't stay home.   Don't believe that it's a slam dunk.  This is how we're going to counter it  by encouraging people through the various platforms that we participate  with to tell people you can't -- you can't take it for granted.  Don't  assume just because the fruit meaning the results of this administration of  this President are so good, that it is impossible for people to vote for  Democrats, no.  The -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I was just -- </p><p>CAIN:  They are using nefarious deceptive rhetoric in order to try to get  people's vote for Democrats which is a bad idea as you know and this is  what we are fighting with our messages.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Marie is kind of a big old Democrat because she actually  worked in the State Department Undersecretary State John Kerry, worked in  the Obama administration, so you're kind of -- but this is an issue and I  want to get to there is one other thing about Alibaba,  Chairman Jack Ma  walk -- has walked back promise to create one million jobs in the United  States.</p><p>Saying that the trade dispute is to blame the Chinese tech billionaire who  made this promise in 2017 while speaking with then-President Elect Trump,  said his commitment contingent on good relations between the U.S. and  China, and these retaliatory tariffs are specifically targeted whether  you're talking about China or even what Europe has done at red districts  and Republican districts.  So it's political.  What this retaliation from  these nations, Herman.  </p><p>CAIN:  You're absolutely right.  First, Marie not all Democrats, we can  only save the savable, OK?  Now, to your point, Dagen, this is the points  that I want to make, if it's a good business decision for Alibaba they will  eventually come back with that offer, that's what's going to drive it.   Secondly, I understand why he may have retracted it because maybe he didn't  want to ruffle feathers of the Chinese government at that particular time.</p><p>But ultimately, if this is a goods business decision and these negotiations  and this tension is reduced, it could be something that he would readdress,  simply because he is motivated by making a good business decision but he  has to put up a smiley face right now to say that he is on the side of the  Chinese government.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Well said, Herman.  Thank you so much for being here.   Herman Cain.  Pleasure always, sir.  </p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  Health hazards after Hurricane Florence standing  water in overflow of farm waste causing a public health emergency in the  Carolinas.  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar joins us this  hour with how the administration is helping those affected by this  disaster.  Plus the battle for Sky TV heads to the auction block.  The  latest on the bidding war between Comcast and the parent company of this  network, 21st Century Fox, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  I'm Cheryl Casone with some of your headlines.  A suspect arrested  after the murder of a jogger in the nation's capital.  Police in Washington  arrested a man last night after a FEMA jogger was stabbed multiple times  and killed in a residential neighborhood.  Police are expected to hold a  news conference to give us more details on the case at 10:30 a.m.  Eastern  time this morning.</p><p>After being attacked Tuesday night, 35-year-old Wendy Martinez who has  newly engaged stumbled into a takeout restaurant for help.  She later died  at a hospital.  Police believe she was likely a random target.  </p><p>Well, breaking news this morning.  Shares of Under Armour, they're actually  rallying in premarket up more than three percent right now.  The company  says it is going to cut about 474 jobs as part of a restructuring plan.   That works out to three percent of its global workforce.  Under Armour also  raising its profit outlook for 2018.  Under Armour also releasing its new  rock sneakers today as in, yes, the rock.  There you go.</p><p>Well, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been reelected head of the  ruling liberal Democratic Party third term.  Abe is on course to become  Japan's longest serving prime minister in August of 2021.  He finishes out  his term of course.  Abe won the election on a landslide receiving 70  percent of the votes.  </p><p>And there is this.  Some main lobsters are getting baked before getting  boiled.  Let me explain.  The restaurant Charlotte's Legendary Lobster  Pound which is in Seawall is getting some its lobsters high on pot.  They  blow the smoke into their tank before they cook them.  The owner, Charlotte  Gill is a registered medical marijuana caregiver and she says doing this  seems bit more humane.</p><p>Earlier researches found lobsters have an advanced nervous system and may  feel pain.  Gill says a lobster she experimented on is much calmer  afterwards.  And then she released it back to the ocean.  She's only going  to use this method if a customer requests it.  All right.  Coming up,  optimism waning.  The risks and worries, some top executives have about why  this economic sweet spot won't last much longer.</p><p>Plus, move over pizza rat.  A New York rodent also discovered in a New York  City subway.  It's taking the internet by storm.  You don't want to miss  that one.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome Back.  How long can the economic boon last?  A new  Deloitte survey finds less than half of chief financial officers expect  better economic conditions in a year and that's the lowest recorded in  eight quarters.  Joining us with much more on these findings.  A first on  Fox Business interview.  Deloitte's Global CFO program leader Sandy  Cockrell.  Sandy, good to see you.  </p><p>SANDY COCKRELL, GLOBAL LEADER OF THE CFO PROGRAM, DELOITTE TOUCHE TOHMATSU  LIMITED:  Dagen, great to see you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How do you read and let's start with that statistic.  How do you  read into that?  What does that tell you about the road ahead?  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Well, first of all, it's really important.  The second quarter  has some of the highest survey recordings, you know, we have ever seen.  So  we're coming down some very high metrics.  And if you look at the U.S.  economy, the North American company, nine out of 10 CFOs still say at least  good.  So that's positive.  One of the statistics that just jumped out of  us is definitely -- think actually positive again, dividend growth.</p><p>7.4 percent forecasted dividend growth over next year.  That is a survey  record just off the charts.  So especially in retail wholesale and energy  and resources stocks.  So those investors are sitting pretty good right  now.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  So, Sandy, two  things, one, are these public companies?  The CFOs of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes.  130 some CFOs participated this quarter.  We've done this  for eight years and most all of these are from public multinational  companies with billion dollars of sales.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And just historically, are they a good indicator or, you know,  because sometimes they'll see people -- results like this come in as  contrarian indicators.  They're historically been good at predicting.  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes.  All the metrics, we follow a number of metrics.  Revenue  growth, earnings growth, capital expenditures are in growth and those  metrics really do kind of follow other economic indices in pretty good way.   Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  Are these companies have large international component?  Do they  make a distinction between what they see in Europe and Asia versus the  U.S.?</p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  And do they see the U.S. as being good and the rest of the world  being bad or to think U.S. is in trouble?  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Steve, what we saw this quarter is still huge amount of optimism  for the North American economy.  For the Chinese economy and the European  economy they slid.  If you look at China, so only 32 percent of the CFOs  said the Chinese economy is good today, 55 percent last quarter.  So, huge  dramatic shift.  You got to wonder if CFOs are worried about the trade  wards and tariffs --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  How much damage let's say, worst happens, 25 percent tariffs the  end of the year, sales taxes on 207 billion or whatever number of imports.   What do you think that's going to do, the U.S. economy into the global  economy.  How much damage?  Right now people sort of pooh-pooh it but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COCKRELL:  Well, we're starting to see -- you know, it's interesting if you  think where we are in calendar year.  Most calendar companies are just  starting their planning processes for 2019.  If you're a multinationalist  pushing a lot of goods or global supply chain, you really just scratching  your head as to what to do your pricing, what does that do to margins and  all those things.  And that got reflected in company --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  So is this uncertainty affecting investment decisions?  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes, yes.  In other -- and just to that point, there is a huge  bias this quarter to invest organically as opposed to inorganically through  M&amp;A, partly due to uncertainty.  Secondly, 71 percent of the CFOs said that  U.S. equity markets were overvalued.  Now that was basically a month ago,  S&amp;P 500 has moved up three percent since then.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So if you think the market is overvalued, would that impact  share buybacks, would you take that money and invest it in a different way?</p><p>COCKRELL:  Well, you know, that's the interesting thing with the 7.4  percent forecasted dividend growth, that really comes from a few things.   Number one, obviously company performance has been very strong.  You know,  forecasting 8.1 percent basically earnings growth over the next 12 months.   So a lot of cash accumulation from that second tax reform in two elements.   Number one, lower rate and number two for multinationals having the ability  to repatriate cash in effective way.</p><p>And number three, companies and CFOs are a lot more sensitive today about  their capital allocation methodologies because of activism.  You have to  be.  And so that's really fueling dividend growth over the next year.  </p><p>FORBES:  Activism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I want to --</p><p>FORBES:  Can you spell that out?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Well --</p><p>MURPHY:  It's fine.  Go ahead, Steve.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  He said activism spell that out.  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes.  So shareholder activism and basically investors expecting  a lot more in terms of overall returns.  We see this in the news every day,  you really got to stay on toes to be able to not be a target of activist.   And a company that has a lot of cash sitting on balance sheet that doesn't  explain what they're going to do with it, they become a target.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike, real quick.  </p><p>MURPHY:  So just real quick.  So ultimately, the results of this study are  that the economy is good but they don't see it being great for that long.  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes. The North American economy is very strong.  When we ask  what does it looked like a year from now, less than half the CFOs said the  U.S. economy will be better one year from now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there's kind of the paid worry warts, aren't they, Steve?   They're the ones who are paid to worry while the CEOs think kind of big  picture 10 years down the road.  </p><p>COCKRELL:  Yes.  Well, I get to a spend a lot of time with CFOs, I think  they're pretty good people. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't say worry warts were bad people.  Why do you think I  bite my fingernails?  Sandy, thank you.</p><p>COCKRELL:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank so much.  Great insight in the survey.</p><p>COCKRELL:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sandy Cockrell from Delloite.  Coming up.  The battle for Sky  TV.  The latest on the bidding war between Comcast and the parent company  of this network, 21st Century Fox later this hour.  And a cryptic  countdown.  We revel the secret behind Olive Garden's mysterious countdown  clock ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back everybody I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It's Thursday, September 20th.  And we've got breaking news  right here right now.</p><p>Jobless claims coming in for the most recent week, look at that coming in  well below expectations which is good, 201,000.  The lower the number on  your weekly jobless claims, the better that is as a sign of a very healthy  labor market.  These are people filing first time claims for unemployment  benefits.  </p><p>We're also getting a reading on the Philadelphia Fed Index and that came in  above expectations, 22.9 in the month of September versus an estimate of 17  points.  We got Mike Murphy standing by.  But look at these markets go, Dow  Jones Futures are up 114 points at the moment.  So we've got a rally across  the board.</p><p>This is a critical day for the market because we could, we could hit a new  all-time high, all-time closing high.  The Blue Chips, the Dow is two --  about 211 points away from its all-time closing high hit earlier this year  in January.  </p><p>Let's talk about this Mike Murphy, what do you make of these numbers?  Like  when you get the jobless claims number close to 200,000 and came in  201,000, that just tells you how healthy this job market --</p><p>MURPHY:  News flash, the economy is doing great and I think of the -- to  the people watching at home, big mistake people make I think is saying this  can't continue.  </p><p>But it can continue, there's no rule or law that says that this has to  stop.  Right now the economy is hitting on all cylinders, we're doing  great.  People have jobs, people have money to spend, that's a good thing,  it's a great time to be in the United States, it's a great time to be  investing.  Don't think the market is too high, you can still invest in the  market at these levels because of the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What did President Trump tweet earlier Steve?  He's like, \"Eh,  if they don't\" -- I'm paraphrasing but, \"If you don't like your job and  they're not treating you right, go get another one because the job market  is great.\"  I just think that that's kind of the optimism that -- </p><p>FORBES:  It would be a good thing to see what it does to the housing market  if this thing last for a couple of years which it should.  People become  mobile again, that's going to be good for housing, housing market.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.  And when people buy homes that -- particularly  new homes, that really spreads to mini corners of the economy in terms the  building and --</p><p>FORBES:  And the very fact that people are still caution is good for the  stock market.</p><p>MURPHY:  Exactly.</p><p>FORBES:  for people to get optimistic you got to get pessimistic.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  IF it feels good, stay out.  If feels bad or cautious, get in.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  And on housing, you know, mortgage rates up at seven years  highs right now.  So that's one thing to keep an eye on.  </p><p>If anyone's looking to buy homes, probably a great time because as the  economy improves, would expect rates (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FORBES:  Would you do floating rates or fixed rate if you're building the  house.</p><p>MURPHY:  I would do fixed rate for certain.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  At this point with the -- I mean, you're going to put your  hands in the -- in the put your money in the hands of the Federal Reserve  or you're buying a house, I don't know, not right now.  </p><p>Thank you gentlemen.  But we want to move on to Florence's fallout, now  causing a public health hazard.  Massive flooding slamming North Carolina's  hog farm.  This is the largest concentration of hog farms in the country.</p><p>More than 5,000 of the state's hogs and pigs, dad waste lagoons, dozens of  waste lagoons overflowing causing a health hazard.  </p><p>Joining me with more to discuss this and many other topic, Health and Human  Services Secretary, former Elli Lilly Executive, Alex Azar.  Mr. Secretary,  what is HHS doing to address what is clearly a health emergency?</p><p>ALEX AZAR:  We;; the president's been showing personal leadership  throughout this.  He was just down in the Carolinas yesterday and we've  been at HHS have been working under his direction.</p><p>We pre-deployed hundreds of people into there and we're going to be there  as long as it takes to get the job done to help those in Carolina in the  situation, I'm glad to report that the hospitals are up and running,  they're on their power.  We've got most -- nursing homes are back up and  occupied and we've actually gotten every dialysis patient and the Carolina  is accounted for.</p><p>So we've got a long road to go, it's going to be a significant recovery  effort ,we'll be in for the long haul but progress is being made that's  quite good so far.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What kind of monitoring is HHS going to do with this?  And I  bring up the dozen -- the several dozen ways lagoons from these farms that  have overflowed because this was a really serious problem in the Carolinas.  </p><p>I believe it was -- it was almost 20 years ago after Hurricane Floyd in  1999.  And what -- how do you monitor the impacts of these kind of  environmental problems.</p><p>AZAR:  So you're right to raise that after a significant flooding event  like this.  You've got affluent runoff coming from various hog, chicken  farms that can b an issue.  You have to be checking well water as well as  public water supplies.</p><p>We have going got a significant team of an environmental response team from  the Center of Disease Control as well as the Food and Drug Administration  that is ready to deploy.  Now, the state and local governments take the  lead here but we're on standby ready to deploy and be active to a system  and anything that they need.</p><p>But we'll take our cues from the -- from the leadership in North Carolina  and South Carolina here but we've got the resources and we're ready and  you're right, it's significant and important issue of public health.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they communicating with you enough at this point?</p><p>AZAR:  Oh, very much so.  Very much so.  I cannot have been more impressed  by the leadership in South Carolina and North Carolina and our  connectivity.  We've got our teams, they're deployed with their emergency  teams. </p><p>Of course, FEMA is providing overall federal direction, we're tightly  aligned working with the president directly on this.  So no, I think  everything is work as it ought to be working in a situation like this as  catastrophic as the circumstances happen to be.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speaking of the catastrophic circumstances, what is HHS doing  about the mental health issue for all of these residents of the Carolinas?   Because, again, it becomes a -- not just a physical health problem but a  mental health problem as well when people see everything that they have  ever -- that they own essentially destroyed?</p><p>AZAR:  Well you're absolutely right.  The mental health issues are ones  that we'll be dealing with in the weeks and months and even years ahead.   And that's a -- we provide significant support to the state and local  authorities there and public health providers for mental health.</p><p>That's our substance abuse mental health services agency.  We provide  significant grants and expertise to them to assist and providing mental  healthcare services and, of course, deploy our professional -- our  healthcare professionals with our -- with the FEMA emergency response teams  that are there on the ground, at the shelters, able to provide care and  counseling as we speak.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Zack Rosenberg, the Chief of the charity organization SBPUSA.org  was on earlier and he said that he is sensing working with organizations  like FEMA and HUD, Housing in Urban Development, that there is a real  openness to true public private partnerships to make sure that A, gets to  people quickly, that the rebuilding happens quickly.</p><p>Can you speak to that within Health and Human Services particularly given  the fact that you came from the private sector.</p><p>AZAR:  Oh sure.  We -- it's vital that we be open to working with a private  sector, to provide resources.  That's one of the gray aspects of how we  work here in America and the American governmental system that we never try  to carry the burden alone from the government side but rather working in  public/private partnership and taking advantage of the tremendous goodwill  and charity of the American people who see catastrophic situation like  this.</p><p>Their heart goes out to their fellow citizens and they want to be of  assistance not just individual people but companies and organizations and  we work to facilitate that, that's one of the important missions on in our  public health service core.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to turn the opioid crisis, the Wall Street Journal has an  article titled, \"Opioid Crisis Emerges as Dominant Campaign Theme.\"  The  Department of Health and Human services granting $1 billion this week to  fight this opioid crisis.  Can you tell us where that money is going, how  it's being spend?</p><p>AZAR:  You bet.  So the president's been providing decisive leadership  here, highlighting and really making this a central issue or the country,  the opioid epidemic that is devastating so many families, so many  communities across every generation.</p><p>And just yesterday we released a $1 billion of A, the state and local  government that help provide resources for prevention, for treatment, for  recovery.  This is going to help people get into medication-assisted  treatment so they can break the cycle of addiction that's going to help  states in controlling the flow of legal and illegal opioid.  So this is  vital relief around the country for all those suffering from this massive  epidemic.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think that you'll agree with this Mr. Secretary, if a  doctor tries to prescribe you opioids for the first time, you need to push  back on that.  It really starts with the individual in this country.</p><p>AZAR:  It's really important that everybody have a very detailed discussion  with their doctor about what they're being prescribed and why they're being  prescribed.  And you know, we're seeing really positive signs although we  have a long way to go.</p><p>We've seen a reduction in the prescribing rates for legal opioids, we've  seen a 264 percent increase since the president took office of Naloxone  prescriptions which are those drugs, the overdose reversing drugs and we've  seen from 2016 to 2017a 50 percent reduction in heroine use in this  country.</p><p>So we've got a long way to go, we didn't get in this overnight but we're  making progress all working together across our communities.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mr. Secretary, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar,  thank you so much for being here.</p><p>AZAR:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Amazon Go growing, Stuart Varney, he loves to talk  about Amazon and he will do that.  What's next for the e-commerce giant?</p><p>Plus, fighting the flood, more video of this little rodent taking on a  torrential downpour inside a New York City subway.  He's just like the rest  of us who live here, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The battle for sky will be settled by auction this weekend.   Connell McShane on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Hey  Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, hello there  Dagen.  You know, it's interesting, this has been going on for close to two  years, 21 months to be exact between the FOX Business Network parent  company, 21st Century Fox and Comcast over who would end up with the  British broadcasters giant.</p><p>But as regulators come out and said, \"Yes, we're going to have an auction,\"  kind of unusual.  But that what they're going to do starting tomorrow  ending on Saturday.  Max three rounds of biding and we'll see who comes  away with Sky.  Market cap's $35 billion, so certainly the final number you  think would be higher than that.  </p><p>Now, before I go back to you, I also want to mention earnings today  briefly, garden restaurants of Olive Garden chain and also a number of  other restaurant chains, Longhorn Steak House, the Capital Grill and  others, $0.10 better than expected this morning.  In its most recent  quarter, $1.34 versus $1.24, stocks been red hot.  Looks like it will  continue possibly up again an all-time high this morning.</p><p>It's a 40 plus percent over the last 52 weeks and I know, I think you guys  have been following, speaking of Olive Garden Dagen, this story where they  say they're going to have a huge reveal, mysterious countdown clock that  emerge at Olive Garden, we know what it was about, it turns out Olive  Garden is issuing 10 more of its annual pasta passes in some sort of a  digital scavenger hunt.  So strong sales and bad, so the world's a better  place, I believe.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Connell.  Good to see you.  Connell McShane at  the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>Amazon now considering opening as many as 3,000 cashierless, that's cashier  free stores by 2021 according to a recent report.  Joining us now, the Host  of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  You love talking about Amazon.</p><p>STEWART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I do.  It's a brilliant  company with extraordinary power and global reach and the guy who found it,  it is now by far in a way the richest man in the world.</p><p>But what they're doing with these cashierless stores is really very  advanced.  As I understand it, now I've not been to one, they have  experiment (INAUDIBLE) you walk in the store, you put your phone against  some kind of scanner, walk around the store, takes stuff off the shelves  which you want and walk out.</p><p>Everything's scanned and looked at electronically and you get the bill on  your phone a little later.  I don't think any other retailer has anything  close to that and that may well be the way of the future.  But Dagen, I  draw your attention to a New York Times Op-Ed piece which reads as follows,  \"Why Jeff Bezos should push for nobody to get as rich as Jeff Bezos?\"</p><p>The Times is behind the lefties move to reign big tech in especially Jeff  Bezos and especially Amazon.  They're under attack but what happens if the  attacker succeed and reign in Amazon?  Do we still get this kind of  cashierless stores innovation?  My answer is no.</p><p>We've got a problem with the concentration of wealth and power that the  technology economy gives to us but we don't have an answer as to what to do  with it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know, as long as -- as long as they keep innovating I  don't see a problem with it.  And I've got an entire lexicon of hand  gestures that I would gladly teach to those tech billionaires if they would  like to communicate with the New York Times in a nonverbal way.</p><p>VARNEY:  I thought you're having a go at me there because I tend to use my  hands a little do I not?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, no, no.  I do too.  I think that we are from the same stock  if you will.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well the bottom line is that the attack is gathering steam and  it's an attack on America's technology leaders and I don't know where it's  going and I hope it fails.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Me too.  Agreement.  Stuart, thank you.  We will see you in 11  minutes time, almost.  Stuart &amp; -- Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"   Brett Bear is coming up with Stuart, you don't want to miss Brett with Mr.  Varney, 9:00 a.m. Monday through Friday.  Three hours of Stuart straight  ahead.</p><p>But for -- up here first, talk about a tech crunch, how this snack delivery  services making a big splash in Silicon Valley, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Snacking made simple.  The tech savvy delivery service called  Snack Nation securing $12 million in Siri (INAUDIBLE) funding.  The company  founded on the idea of making healthy food more convenient than junkfood.</p><p>Joining us now the company's Co-Founder and CEO Sean Kelly.  Sean,  SnackNation, we attacked these boxes of SnackNation.  So while we eat,  please speak.</p><p>SEAN KELLY, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO, SNACKNATION:  Absolutely.  You want to know a  little bit about SnackNation?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Please sir.</p><p>KELLY:  All right.  We are the authority when it comes to discovering  emerging an innovative snack food brands.  And what we mean more  specifically is that we're a tech enabled snack delivery service that  delivers creations like these to thousands of companies and homes across  the country.</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST:  Sean, you're telling me you can make  something that taste like Cheetos but it's healthier for me, right?</p><p>KELLY:  We don't necessarily make them but --</p><p>HARF:  Or deliver it, not make.</p><p>KELLY:  Absolutely, deliver.  We're go and find the best emerging and  innovative brands that's also better for you and clean delicious and bring  them direct to people.  So you can feel a little bit less bad of having the  snacks you want.</p><p>HARF:  Great.</p><p>MURPHY:  Sean, good to see you.  We are in full disclosure, Rosecliff  Ventures are proud investors in SnackNation, in Sean's business.  One thing  we look forward Dagen when we're investing in a company's strong innovative  leaders and Sean fits that bill, he's an awesome guy.</p><p>But what we love about this is they're delivering their snacks to you at  your business.  You know, we spend -- people are spending over eight hours  a day at work and employers want to make sure that their employees have an  opportunity to eat healthy while they're at work.</p><p>But one thing we love that I love to hear Sean speak about is the data that  they're able to collect.  When they send this box to you at work, what  you're getting out of that Sean?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  In today's world it's so important to be able to continually  iterate and innovate, right, especially if you're a big CPG company.  So  what we do is we go direct to the consumer, have a direct relationship with  them at their most engage moments.</p><p>We collect consumer insights and data that we see back o the brands so they  can better understand their customer and therefore improve their products.   We also use all that data to determine what emerging brands are going to  win tomorrow.  So we have a little bit of a predictive analytics engine  that gives us a leg up in this business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you sell that -- the new -- do you take that new data and  sell it?</p><p>KELLY:  We do.  We sell that actually back to brands and there's also  different ways for us to work with industry leaders and big CPGs to deliver  some of that information to them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So are you growing -- so this is direct to individuals but also  companies.</p><p>KELLY:  Absolutely.  So we started on the enterprise, the reason that we  started, we don't really look at B2B and B2C as being different.  It's all  about just where the consumer is and today's business --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Business-to-business and business-to-consumer.</p><p>KELLY:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's from -- that's from the first.com bubble by the way.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes.  Well that's the -- we like -- we like afternoons.  But  for us it's like, \"Why did you -- why did start at the office?  It's  because it's where the younger generation spends the most time.</p><p>HARF:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  And so for us there's not that much difference.  But being able to  collect these insights and (INAUDIBLE) will have a forward-looking view in  terms of what's going to work and what's not is really important.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I attack this box like I hadn't eaten for the last five  weeks and there -- we're immediately plant-base options in these boxes, not  --</p><p>KELLY:  Well based on a plan that's not going away</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not -- you know, I don't eat any animal products at all.   But it is -- but it goes to also.  </p><p>If you're dealing with corporate customers, if they're trying to make their  entire workforce healthy and keep their healthcare cost down, that's a huge  selling point.</p><p>FORBES:  It's nice with chocolate chip cookies that are healthy and taste  like chocolate chip cookie.</p><p>HARF:  We also have pizza too.</p><p>MURPHY:  To wash down the pizza.  </p><p>KELLY:  Absolutely.  Lenny &amp; Larry's pack of protein, Steve, those are good  for the guns, good for the biceps.</p><p>FORBES:  I'm getting ready for the Olympics.</p><p>MURPHY:  Sean, real quick, is there -- so with this platform, is there  anything after snacks that could next for SnackNation?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  So we're actually setting this up as a platform where we can  really deliver any consumer products through this.  So even though our  focus is on snacks, is in -- by the way, snacks can be anything.</p><p>Seventy percent Americans say that anything can be a snack as long as it's  in a convenient format.  And so we're already starting to plug health and  beauty items and other items to our consumer insights final.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's a -- here's a tip --</p><p>FORBES:  Wow.  Sounds like a mini Amazon.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's a -- here's a tip, cauliflower and cassava flour  crackers, there you go, they're delicious.  </p><p>KELLY:  Love -- I love casara -- cassava, it's great for anti-inflammatory.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  And Sean Kelly, great of you to be here.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, September 20th. Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Supreme Court showdown. Republicans warn that time is running out for Nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser to testify. President Trump defending his pick to the Supreme Court and hopeful that Christine Blasey Ford will testify.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I really want to see her, I really would want to see what she has to say. But I want to give it all the time they need if she shows up that would be wonderful. If she doesn't show up, that would be unfortunate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We have the latest coming up. And we are watching these markets because the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are oh, so close to new all-time highs. On the Dow, all the futures are up 94-point gain on the Dow futures at the moment. 26,616 and change is the old record set for the blue chips January 26th of this year. We will be watching that. This after a bit of a mixed session yesterday, the Dow and S&amp;P moving to plus side.</p><p>The NASDAQ composite dipping lower. Tech stocks taken a bit of a bruising there. Checking the global market action over in Europe, we have buying across the board in England, France, and Germany and every market in Asia overnight up except the Shanghai down just fractionally.</p><p>Florence fallout. Devastating flooding in the Carolinas could wreak havoc on the region for years. And the concerns go well beyond infrastructure. We take a closer look at the health hazards with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar later this hour.</p><p>Alibaba backtracks. Jack Ma, the founder says his company is pledged to create one million jobs in America is off the table. He's blaming the trade dispute that the U.S. is having with China, the fallout ahead.</p><p>On the block, the battle for Sky News will go to auction. We have the details on how this deal's fate could be sealed. All that and so much more coming up this morning, former state department spokesman, host of \"BENSON &amp; HARF\" on Fox News Radio, Maria Harf. Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner Mike Murphy and Forbes Media Chairman and former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes.</p><p>It's been a pleasure so far to spend this morning with you. , it has been a pleasure so far, to spend this morning with you. And just real quick, Steve, because I know you love talking taxes, the corporate tax cut is paying for itself, how about that.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: And Steve Moore had an article on that just a few hours ago, 24 hours ago. Yes. When you get off of people's tax, the economy prospers. And the assets of the nation go up as well as the incomes. And, so for the first time in a long time not only do we have job shortages but also companies are getting in the business that the government can never do, job training.</p><p>That's the best, Corporate America is the best job trainer, you're starting to see that kick in, and so it's nice to have the problem, labor shortages, wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I love to see you smile. That's why I asked you that question, Steve. We've got a lot --</p><p>FORBES: Thank you. I always smile.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. Thank you. Steve Forbes also, the first thing you always ask about my dogs, so thank you for that. To our top story this hour, President Trump hitting the campaign trail. The President will hold a rally in Las Vegas tonight as the midterm elections loom. The GOP pushes ahead -- full steam ahead on confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Blake Burman is joining us with the very latest from the White House. Good morning, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Dagen. Good morning to you as well. Republicans who control the Senate Judiciary Committee have given Christine Blasey Ford an ultimatum. Let us know by tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m. Friday at 10:00 a.m. if you will testify before that committee on Monday, or not. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican who runs that committee says he is giving Ford four different options on how to make that possible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Where I'm focused right now is doing everything that we can to make Dr. Ford comfortable with coming before our committee either in an open session or closed session or a public or a private interviews.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh who Ford says sexually assaulted her at a party during their high school years denies that allegation and says he is ready to head back to the Hill Monday. But Ford's attorney said last night in a statement that timeline is hurried, \"the committee stated plans to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation.\"</p><p>They go on to write, the rush to a hearing is unnecessary and contrary to the committee discovering the truth. Ford's attorneys have also called for law enforcement investigation before she would testify, a position that Democrats support as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (R), NEW YORK: I think staying there testify on Monday, or not be heard I think it is fairly outrageous. And what's really shocking to me that is that there is a normal process for a Supreme Court justice nomination, and it starts with an FBI background check.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Dagen, President Trump continues to stand by his FBI -- his Supreme Court nominee rather. The President said yesterday that if Ford were to testify up the Hill, that would be \"wonderful.\" If not, he described that as \"unfortunate.\" As for the President know official public events on his schedule today, he will thought head later today to Las Vegas for a campaign rally there tonight. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you. Blake Burman at the White House for us. And let's turner to the political impact of this and those midterm elections. 47 days away in an increasingly partisan season. My next guest is launching a super PAC to support President Trump's agenda in the face of escalating liberal backlash. Here with us now is former presidential candidate Herman Cain. Tell us about the initiative in terms of the President's agenda.</p><p>Steve Forbes was talking about some of the results that this country is already seen, good morning.</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning, Dagen. And that's what people should focus on. And that's what we are going to be focusing on with the super PAC called America Fighting Back. And people can help and we need their help at americafighting backpack.com or AFB.com. Here is why we started this. The liberal media and you know who they are, they basically report 90 percent negative about this president.</p><p>And about the results that we are getting similar to the ones that Steve just alluded to. 90 percent negative. This is -- our objective is simple. Number one, help maintain control of the United States House and the United States Senate and to support the President's agenda through 2020. And I have often said, you don't have to love the tree to love the fruit. The fruit is great.</p><p>But all the liberal media and the Democrats want to focus on, they want to focus on bringing down the tree. And so this super PAC America Fighting Back, is going to fight back against the negativity.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Steve have said this, I will debate policy all day long, personality not. What do you have to say to Herman?</p><p>FORBES: Well Herman, the Republicans won going to have an agenda, positive agenda, not just saying the economy is good but how they're going to make it better. And, two, the President looks like he is now going to be focusing on the economy at a great tweet this morning. The key thing is set the agenda and not get sidetracked. The Republicans going to do it and finally, Herman, persuade the Republicans and get a real tax cut proposal out there.</p><p>So people have a Christmas present to look forward to if they win.</p><p>CAIN: I agree with you one hundred percent, Steve. And the thing is yes, this Super PAC along with a lot of other organizations and PACs that are out there, they are doing a good job of trying to get a positive message out about the results that this president and this administration that they are producing. However, the message is sometimes overwhelmed, and what sets us apart is that we will have a voice, this voice and a face, this face to the T.V. ad campaign that we're going to be running.</p><p>And you're right, it's difficult at times to get all of the Republicans to get on the same page. We also hope that this would be a vehicle for them to help get on the same page and deliver that messages as well as that Christmas present you talked about which we know is working out fantastic and they now have momentum behind them as well as actual results based on what you mentioned that Steve Forbes heard about yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: -- in blue states there are about 20 Republicans -- representatives in blue states that are vulnerable, they're all getting hit on assault thing losing to local deductions. How are you going to counter that to save these 20 Republicans?</p><p>CAIN: Our second tactic is a targeted campaign in those very vulnerable states. Remember the Super PAC we're not going to coordinate with them but we know where these races are close. And we have technology that will allow us to target these races so we can then go in and target the voters in those states to tell them the truth. All we have to do is tell people the truth, they will make the right decisions.</p><p>So we are targeting those races in order to try to help out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Marie has a question for you, Herman.</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Herman, Marie Harf here, there is a lot of evidence in polls and anecdotally that the Republican voters are not that fired up this November. Democrats are really enthusiastic, their base is ready to go vote and a lot of stories about Republicans not believing that they might lose the House, there is a lot of apathy. It seems like upon Republicans voters. How are you going to help tackle that issue?</p><p>CAIN: The thing that I talked about on my show yesterday that's posted at my Web site, Hermancain.com, Republicans and Conservatives don't stay home. Don't believe that it's a slam dunk. This is how we're going to counter it by encouraging people through the various platforms that we participate with to tell people you can't -- you can't take it for granted. Don't assume just because the fruit meaning the results of this administration of this President are so good, that it is impossible for people to vote for Democrats, no. The --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. I was just --</p><p>CAIN: They are using nefarious deceptive rhetoric in order to try to get people's vote for Democrats which is a bad idea as you know and this is what we are fighting with our messages.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Marie is kind of a big old Democrat because she actually worked in the State Department Undersecretary State John Kerry, worked in the Obama administration, so you're kind of -- but this is an issue and I want to get to there is one other thing about Alibaba, Chairman Jack Ma walk -- has walked back promise to create one million jobs in the United States.</p><p>Saying that the trade dispute is to blame the Chinese tech billionaire who made this promise in 2017 while speaking with then-President Elect Trump, said his commitment contingent on good relations between the U.S. and China, and these retaliatory tariffs are specifically targeted whether you're talking about China or even what Europe has done at red districts and Republican districts. So it's political. What this retaliation from these nations, Herman.</p><p>CAIN: You're absolutely right. First, Marie not all Democrats, we can only save the savable, OK? Now, to your point, Dagen, this is the points that I want to make, if it's a good business decision for Alibaba they will eventually come back with that offer, that's what's going to drive it. Secondly, I understand why he may have retracted it because maybe he didn't want to ruffle feathers of the Chinese government at that particular time.</p><p>But ultimately, if this is a goods business decision and these negotiations and this tension is reduced, it could be something that he would readdress, simply because he is motivated by making a good business decision but he has to put up a smiley face right now to say that he is on the side of the Chinese government.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Well said, Herman. Thank you so much for being here. Herman Cain. Pleasure always, sir.</p><p>CAIN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up.

How do you read into that? What does that tell you about the road ahead?</p><p>COCKRELL: Well, first of all, it's really important. The second quarter has some of the highest survey recordings, you know, we have ever seen. So we're coming down some very high metrics. And if you look at the U.S. economy, the North American company, nine out of 10 CFOs still say at least good. So that's positive. One of the statistics that just jumped out of us is definitely -- think actually positive again, dividend growth.</p><p>7.4 percent forecasted dividend growth over next year. That is a survey record just off the charts. So especially in retail wholesale and energy and resources stocks. So those investors are sitting pretty good right now.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: So, Sandy, two things, one, are these public companies? The CFOs of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COCKRELL: Yes. 130 some CFOs participated this quarter. We've done this for eight years and most all of these are from public multinational companies with billion dollars of sales.</p><p>MURPHY: And just historically, are they a good indicator or, you know, because sometimes they'll see people -- results like this come in as contrarian indicators. They're historically been good at predicting.</p><p>COCKRELL: Yes. All the metrics, we follow a number of metrics. Revenue growth, earnings growth, capital expenditures are in growth and those metrics really do kind of follow other economic indices in pretty good way. Yes.</p><p>FORBES: Are these companies have large international component? Do they make a distinction between what they see in Europe and Asia versus the U.S.?</p><p>COCKRELL: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: And do they see the U.S. as being good and the rest of the world being bad or to think U.S. is in trouble?</p><p>COCKRELL: Steve, what we saw this quarter is still huge amount of optimism for the North American economy. For the Chinese economy and the European economy they slid. If you look at China, so only 32 percent of the CFOs said the Chinese economy is good today, 55 percent last quarter. So, huge dramatic shift. You got to wonder if CFOs are worried about the trade wards and tariffs --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: How much damage let's say, worst happens, 25 percent tariffs the end of the year, sales taxes on 207 billion or whatever number of imports. What do you think that's going to do, the U.S. economy into the global economy. How much damage? Right now people sort of pooh-pooh it but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COCKRELL: Well, we're starting to see -- you know, it's interesting if you think where we are in calendar year. Most calendar companies are just starting their planning processes for 2019. If you're a multinationalist pushing a lot of goods or global supply chain, you really just scratching your head as to what to do your pricing, what does that do to margins and all those things. And that got reflected in company --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: So is this uncertainty affecting investment decisions?</p><p>COCKRELL: Yes, yes. In other -- and just to that point, there is a huge bias this quarter to invest organically as opposed to inorganically through M&amp;A, partly due to uncertainty. Secondly, 71 percent of the CFOs said that U.S. equity markets were overvalued. Now that was basically a month ago, S&amp;P 500 has moved up three percent since then.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So if you think the market is overvalued, would that impact share buybacks, would you take that money and invest it in a different way?</p><p>COCKRELL: Well, you know, that's the interesting thing with the 7.4 percent forecasted dividend growth, that really comes from a few things. Number one, obviously company performance has been very strong. You know, forecasting 8.1 percent basically earnings growth over the next 12 months. So a lot of cash accumulation from that second tax reform in two elements. Number one, lower rate and number two for multinationals having the ability to repatriate cash in effective way.</p><p>And number three, companies and CFOs are a lot more sensitive today about their capital allocation methodologies because of activism. You have to be. And so that's really fueling dividend growth over the next year.</p><p>FORBES: Activism.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I want to --</p><p>FORBES: Can you spell that out?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Well --</p><p>MURPHY: It's fine. Go ahead, Steve.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. He said activism spell that out.</p><p>COCKRELL: Yes. So shareholder activism and basically investors expecting a lot more in terms of overall returns. We see this in the news every day, you really got to stay on toes to be able to not be a target of activist. And a company that has a lot of cash sitting on balance sheet that doesn't explain what they're going to do with it, they become a target.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, real quick.</p><p>MURPHY: So just real quick. So ultimately, the results of this study are that the economy is good but they don't see it being great for that long.</p><p>COCKRELL: Yes. The North American economy is very strong. When we ask what does it looked like a year from now, less than half the CFOs said the U.S. economy will be better one year from now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But there's kind of the paid worry warts, aren't they, Steve? They're the ones who are paid to worry while the CEOs think kind of big picture 10 years down the road.</p><p>COCKRELL: Yes. Well, I get to a spend a lot of time with CFOs, I think they're pretty good people.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I didn't say worry warts were bad people. Why do you think I bite my fingernails? Sandy, thank you.</p><p>COCKRELL: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank so much. Great insight in the survey.</p><p>COCKRELL: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sandy Cockrell from Delloite. Coming up. The battle for Sky TV. The latest on the bidding war between Comcast and the parent company of this network, 21st Century Fox later this hour. And a cryptic countdown. We revel the secret behind Olive Garden's mysterious countdown clock ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back everybody I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, September 20th. And we've got breaking news right here right now.</p><p>Jobless claims coming in for the most recent week, look at that coming in well below expectations which is good, 201,000. The lower the number on your weekly jobless claims, the better that is as a sign of a very healthy labor market. These are people filing first time claims for unemployment benefits.</p><p>We're also getting a reading on the Philadelphia Fed Index and that came in above expectations, 22.9 in the month of September versus an estimate of 17 points. We got Mike Murphy standing by. But look at these markets go, Dow Jones Futures are up 114 points at the moment. So we've got a rally across the board.</p><p>This is a critical day for the market because we could, we could hit a new all-time high, all-time closing high. The Blue Chips, the Dow is two -- about 211 points away from its all-time closing high hit earlier this year in January.</p><p>Let's talk about this Mike Murphy, what do you make of these numbers? Like when you get the jobless claims number close to 200,000 and came in 201,000, that just tells you how healthy this job market --</p><p>MURPHY: News flash, the economy is doing great and I think of the -- to the people watching at home, big mistake people make I think is saying this can't continue.</p><p>But it can continue, there's no rule or law that says that this has to stop. Right now the economy is hitting on all cylinders, we're doing great. People have jobs, people have money to spend, that's a good thing, it's a great time to be in the United States, it's a great time to be investing. Don't think the market is too high, you can still invest in the market at these levels because of the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What did President Trump tweet earlier Steve? He's like, \"Eh, if they don't\" -- I'm paraphrasing but, \"If you don't like your job and they're not treating you right, go get another one because the job market is great.\" I just think that that's kind of the optimism that --</p><p>FORBES: It would be a good thing to see what it does to the housing market if this thing last for a couple of years which it should. People become mobile again, that's going to be good for housing, housing market.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, absolutely. And when people buy homes that -- particularly new homes, that really spreads to mini corners of the economy in terms the building and --</p><p>FORBES: And the very fact that people are still caution is good for the stock market.</p><p>MURPHY: Exactly.</p><p>FORBES: for people to get optimistic you got to get pessimistic.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: IF it feels good, stay out. If feels bad or cautious, get in.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. And on housing, you know, mortgage rates up at seven years highs right now. So that's one thing to keep an eye on.</p><p>If anyone's looking to buy homes, probably a great time because as the economy improves, would expect rates (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FORBES: Would you do floating rates or fixed rate if you're building the house.</p><p>MURPHY: I would do fixed rate for certain.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. At this point with the -- I mean, you're going to put your hands in the -- in the put your money in the hands of the Federal Reserve or you're buying a house, I don't know, not right now.</p><p>Thank you gentlemen. But we want to move on to Florence's fallout, now causing a public health hazard. Massive flooding slamming North Carolina's hog farm. This is the largest concentration of hog farms in the country.</p><p>More than 5,000 of the state's hogs and pigs, dad waste lagoons, dozens of waste lagoons overflowing causing a health hazard.</p><p>Joining me with more to discuss this and many other topic, Health and Human Services Secretary, former Elli Lilly Executive, Alex Azar. Mr. Secretary, what is HHS doing to address what is clearly a health emergency?</p><p>ALEX AZAR: We;; the president's been showing personal leadership throughout this. He was just down in the Carolinas yesterday and we've been at HHS have been working under his direction.</p><p>We pre-deployed hundreds of people into there and we're going to be there as long as it takes to get the job done to help those in Carolina in the situation, I'm glad to report that the hospitals are up and running, they're on their power. We've got most -- nursing homes are back up and occupied and we've actually gotten every dialysis patient and the Carolina is accounted for.</p><p>So we've got a long road to go, it's going to be a significant recovery effort ,we'll be in for the long haul but progress is being made that's quite good so far.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What kind of monitoring is HHS going to do with this? And I bring up the dozen -- the several dozen ways lagoons from these farms that have overflowed because this was a really serious problem in the Carolinas.</p><p>I believe it was -- it was almost 20 years ago after Hurricane Floyd in 1999. And what -- how do you monitor the impacts of these kind of environmental problems.</p><p>AZAR: So you're right to raise that after a significant flooding event like this. You've got affluent runoff coming from various hog, chicken farms that can b an issue. You have to be checking well water as well as public water supplies.</p><p>We have going got a significant team of an environmental response team from the Center of Disease Control as well as the Food and Drug Administration that is ready to deploy. Now, the state and local governments take the lead here but we're on standby ready to deploy and be active to a system and anything that they need.</p><p>But we'll take our cues from the -- from the leadership in North Carolina and South Carolina here but we've got the resources and we're ready and you're right, it's significant and important issue of public health.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are they communicating with you enough at this point?</p><p>AZAR: Oh, very much so. Very much so. I cannot have been more impressed by the leadership in South Carolina and North Carolina and our connectivity. We've got our teams, they're deployed with their emergency teams.</p><p>Of course, FEMA is providing overall federal direction, we're tightly aligned working with the president directly on this. So no, I think everything is work as it ought to be working in a situation like this as catastrophic as the circumstances happen to be.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Speaking of the catastrophic circumstances, what is HHS doing about the mental health issue for all of these residents of the Carolinas? Because, again, it becomes a -- not just a physical health problem but a mental health problem as well when people see everything that they have ever -- that they own essentially destroyed?</p><p>AZAR: Well you're absolutely right. The mental health issues are ones that we'll be dealing with in the weeks and months and even years ahead. And that's a -- we provide significant support to the state and local authorities there and public health providers for mental health.</p><p>That's our substance abuse mental health services agency. We provide significant grants and expertise to them to assist and providing mental healthcare services and, of course, deploy our professional -- our healthcare professionals with our -- with the FEMA emergency response teams that are there on the ground, at the shelters, able to provide care and counseling as we speak.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Zack Rosenberg, the Chief of the charity organization SBPUSA.org was on earlier and he said that he is sensing working with organizations like FEMA and HUD, Housing in Urban Development, that there is a real openness to true public private partnerships to make sure that A, gets to people quickly, that the rebuilding happens quickly.</p><p>Can you speak to that within Health and Human Services particularly given the fact that you came from the private sector.</p><p>AZAR: Oh sure. We -- it's vital that we be open to working with a private sector, to provide resources. That's one of the gray aspects of how we work here in America and the American governmental system that we never try to carry the burden alone from the government side but rather working in public/private partnership and taking advantage of the tremendous goodwill and charity of the American people who see catastrophic situation like this.</p><p>Their heart goes out to their fellow citizens and they want to be of assistance not just individual people but companies and organizations and we work to facilitate that, that's one of the important missions on in our public health service core.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to turn the opioid crisis, the Wall Street Journal has an article titled, \"Opioid Crisis Emerges as Dominant Campaign Theme.\" The Department of Health and Human services granting $1 billion this week to fight this opioid crisis. Can you tell us where that money is going, how it's being spend?</p><p>AZAR: You bet. So the president's been providing decisive leadership here, highlighting and really making this a central issue or the country, the opioid epidemic that is devastating so many families, so many communities across every generation.</p><p>And just yesterday we released a $1 billion of A, the state and local government that help provide resources for prevention, for treatment, for recovery. This is going to help people get into medication-assisted treatment so they can break the cycle of addiction that's going to help states in controlling the flow of legal and illegal opioid. So this is vital relief around the country for all those suffering from this massive epidemic.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I think that you'll agree with this Mr. Secretary, if a doctor tries to prescribe you opioids for the first time, you need to push back on that. It really starts with the individual in this country.</p><p>AZAR: It's really important that everybody have a very detailed discussion with their doctor about what they're being prescribed and why they're being prescribed. And you know, we're seeing really positive signs although we have a long way to go.</p><p>We've seen a reduction in the prescribing rates for legal opioids, we've seen a 264 percent increase since the president took office of Naloxone prescriptions which are those drugs, the overdose reversing drugs and we've seen from 2016 to 2017a 50 percent reduction in heroine use in this country.</p><p>So we've got a long way to go, we didn't get in this overnight but we're making progress all working together across our communities.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mr. Secretary, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>AZAR: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, Amazon Go growing, Stuart Varney, he loves to talk about Amazon and he will do that. What's next for the e-commerce giant?</p><p>Plus, fighting the flood, more video of this little rodent taking on a torrential downpour inside a New York City subway. He's just like the rest of us who live here, we'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The battle for sky will be settled by auction this weekend. Connell McShane on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more. Hey Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey, hello there Dagen. You know, it's interesting, this has been going on for close to two years, 21 months to be exact between the FOX Business Network parent company, 21st Century Fox and Comcast over who would end up with the British broadcasters giant.</p><p>But as regulators come out and said, \"Yes, we're going to have an auction,\" kind of unusual. But that what they're going to do starting tomorrow ending on Saturday. Max three rounds of biding and we'll see who comes away with Sky. Market cap's $35 billion, so certainly the final number you think would be higher than that.</p><p>Now, before I go back to you, I also want to mention earnings today briefly, garden restaurants of Olive Garden chain and also a number of other restaurant chains, Longhorn Steak House, the Capital Grill and others, $0.10 better than expected this morning. In its most recent quarter, $1.34 versus $1.24, stocks been red hot. Looks like it will continue possibly up again an all-time high this morning.</p><p>It's a 40 plus percent over the last 52 weeks and I know, I think you guys have been following, speaking of Olive Garden Dagen, this story where they say they're going to have a huge reveal, mysterious countdown clock that emerge at Olive Garden, we know what it was about, it turns out Olive Garden is issuing 10 more of its annual pasta passes in some sort of a digital scavenger hunt. So strong sales and bad, so the world's a better place, I believe.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much Connell. Good to see you. Connell McShane at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Amazon now considering opening as many as 3,000 cashierless, that's cashier free stores by 2021 according to a recent report. Joining us now, the Host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney. You love talking about Amazon.</p><p>STEWART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I do. It's a brilliant company with extraordinary power and global reach and the guy who found it, it is now by far in a way the richest man in the world.</p><p>But what they're doing with these cashierless stores is really very advanced. As I understand it, now I've not been to one, they have experiment (INAUDIBLE) you walk in the store, you put your phone against some kind of scanner, walk around the store, takes stuff off the shelves which you want and walk out.</p><p>Everything's scanned and looked at electronically and you get the bill on your phone a little later. I don't think any other retailer has anything close to that and that may well be the way of the future. But Dagen, I draw your attention to a New York Times Op-Ed piece which reads as follows, \"Why Jeff Bezos should push for nobody to get as rich as Jeff Bezos?\"</p><p>The Times is behind the lefties move to reign big tech in especially Jeff Bezos and especially Amazon. They're under attack but what happens if the attacker succeed and reign in Amazon? Do we still get this kind of cashierless stores innovation? My answer is no.</p><p>We've got a problem with the concentration of wealth and power that the technology economy gives to us but we don't have an answer as to what to do with it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know, as long as -- as long as they keep innovating I don't see a problem with it. And I've got an entire lexicon of hand gestures that I would gladly teach to those tech billionaires if they would like to communicate with the New York Times in a nonverbal way.</p><p>VARNEY: I thought you're having a go at me there because I tend to use my hands a little do I not?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, no, no. I do too. I think that we are from the same stock if you will.</p><p>VARNEY: Well the bottom line is that the attack is gathering steam and it's an attack on America's technology leaders and I don't know where it's going and I hope it fails.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Me too. Agreement. Stuart, thank you. We will see you in 11 minutes time, almost. Stuart &amp; -- Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" Brett Bear is coming up with Stuart, you don't want to miss Brett with Mr. Varney, 9:00 a.m. Monday through Friday. Three hours of Stuart straight ahead.</p><p>But for -- up here first, talk about a tech crunch, how this snack delivery services making a big splash in Silicon Valley, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Snacking made simple. The tech savvy delivery service called Snack Nation securing $12 million in Siri (INAUDIBLE) funding. The company founded on the idea of making healthy food more convenient than junkfood.</p><p>Joining us now the company's Co-Founder and CEO Sean Kelly. Sean, SnackNation, we attacked these boxes of SnackNation. So while we eat, please speak.</p><p>SEAN KELLY, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO, SNACKNATION: Absolutely. You want to know a little bit about SnackNation?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Please sir.</p><p>KELLY: All right. We are the authority when it comes to discovering emerging an innovative snack food brands. And what we mean more specifically is that we're a tech enabled snack delivery service that delivers creations like these to thousands of companies and homes across the country.</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: Sean, you're telling me you can make something that taste like Cheetos but it's healthier for me, right?</p><p>KELLY: We don't necessarily make them but --</p><p>HARF: Or deliver it, not make.</p><p>KELLY: Absolutely, deliver. We're go and find the best emerging and innovative brands that's also better for you and clean delicious and bring them direct to people. So you can feel a little bit less bad of having the snacks you want.</p><p>HARF: Great.</p><p>MURPHY: Sean, good to see you. We are in full disclosure, Rosecliff Ventures are proud investors in SnackNation, in Sean's business. One thing we look forward Dagen when we're investing in a company's strong innovative leaders and Sean fits that bill, he's an awesome guy.</p><p>But what we love about this is they're delivering their snacks to you at your business. You know, we spend -- people are spending over eight hours a day at work and employers want to make sure that their employees have an opportunity to eat healthy while they're at work.</p><p>But one thing we love that I love to hear Sean speak about is the data that they're able to collect. When they send this box to you at work, what you're getting out of that Sean?</p><p>KELLY: Yes. In today's world it's so important to be able to continually iterate and innovate, right, especially if you're a big CPG company. So what we do is we go direct to the consumer, have a direct relationship with them at their most engage moments.</p><p>We collect consumer insights and data that we see back o the brands so they can better understand their customer and therefore improve their products. We also use all that data to determine what emerging brands are going to win tomorrow. So we have a little bit of a predictive analytics engine that gives us a leg up in this business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you sell that -- the new -- do you take that new data and sell it?</p><p>KELLY: We do. We sell that actually back to brands and there's also different ways for us to work with industry leaders and big CPGs to deliver some of that information to them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So are you growing -- so this is direct to individuals but also companies.</p><p>KELLY: Absolutely. So we started on the enterprise, the reason that we started, we don't really look at B2B and B2C as being different. It's all about just where the consumer is and today's business --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Business-to-business and business-to-consumer.</p><p>KELLY: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's from -- that's from the first.com bubble by the way.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. Yes. Well that's the -- we like -- we like afternoons. But for us it's like, \"Why did you -- why did start at the office? It's because it's where the younger generation spends the most time.</p><p>HARF: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: And so for us there's not that much difference. But being able to collect these insights and (INAUDIBLE) will have a forward-looking view in terms of what's going to work and what's not is really important.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I attack this box like I hadn't eaten for the last five weeks and there -- we're immediately plant-base options in these boxes, not --</p><p>KELLY: Well based on a plan that's not going away</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not -- you know, I don't eat any animal products at all. But it is -- but it goes to also.</p><p>If you're dealing with corporate customers, if they're trying to make their entire workforce healthy and keep their healthcare cost down, that's a huge selling point.</p><p>FORBES: It's nice with chocolate chip cookies that are healthy and taste like chocolate chip cookie.</p><p>HARF: We also have pizza too.</p><p>MURPHY: To wash down the pizza.</p><p>KELLY: Absolutely. Lenny &amp; Larry's pack of protein, Steve, those are good for the guns, good for the biceps.</p><p>FORBES: I'm getting ready for the Olympics.</p><p>MURPHY: Sean, real quick, is there -- so with this platform, is there anything after snacks that could next for SnackNation?</p><p>KELLY: Yes. So we're actually setting this up as a platform where we can really deliver any consumer products through this. So even though our focus is on snacks, is in -- by the way, snacks can be anything.</p><p>Seventy percent Americans say that anything can be a snack as long as it's in a convenient format. And so we're already starting to plug health and beauty items and other items to our consumer insights final.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's a -- here's a tip --</p><p>FORBES: Wow. Sounds like a mini Amazon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>KELLY: Well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's a -- here's a tip, cauliflower and cassava flour crackers, there you go, they're delicious.</p><p>KELLY: Love -- I love casara -- cassava, it's great for anti-inflammatory.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. And Sean Kelly, great of you to be here. Please come back sir.</p><p>KELLY: Thanks so much, appreciate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nice to see you.</p><p>KELLY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The flood rat next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'd say thank you and so long to Marie, Mike, and the fabulous Steve Forbes and we hope that flood rat's OK.

MARK MEADOWS (R-N.C.) </p><p>FAITH AND FREEDOM COALITION CHAIRMAN RALPH REED </p><p>[*]BLACKBURN: Well, greetings, and how wonderful to see you all here instead of off campuses, as we say, which is where you usually are when I have joined you. And as I do each year, I want to first of all, say thank you to you for your interest and for your willingness to pay your own way here and attend a conference that is really going to shore you up and give you the information you need to talk to your friends and neighbors.  </p><p>I was just talking to a reporter outside the room and he said, \"Why is a conference like this important?\" I said, \"Let me tell you why. Fewer and fewer people believe what they hear on the evening news and they listen to it with skepticism and doubt. But you know who they do believe? They believe their neighbors and friends.\" And I bet if I asked for a show of hands, how many of you every day get an email, hear from a friend, go to church and somebody says, \"Look at this that I read on the Internet. Is this true? What do you know about this?\"  </p><p>The most important name in news now is not ABC, which I still call them the All 'Bout Clinton News Network-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--or NBC, or CBS, or CNN, it is the Y-O-U, it is you and your circle of friends. That is who you're listening to. That is who they are listening to. They're listening to you. So I applaud you for being here. I thank you so much for your heartfelt interest. And I encourage you in getting the education that you need to help individuals know what is a constitutional, truthful vote, what is a constitutional, truthful position. And having them understand that, indeed, elections have consequences and who is in charge matters and who you're listening to makes a difference. I say Tommy Waller, if I want to know something about Israel I know who to call. And these are people that you rely on, because they are your friends. So thank you for that.  </p><p>Now, what I thought I would do today, a little bit different from what I've talked with you about in past years, coming to the Senate, and you're going to get to hear from some of the senior senators who've been plowing away on issues here in the Senate, I thought I would recap for you what I think are the top 10 most important items that I have worked on since coming to the Senate, then I'm going to yield the floor to some of these other guys. But, you know, it's always good to hear from a good, solid, conservative woman first, right? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I tell my family all the time, \"I'm the Chief Mama in Charge and what I say goes.\" So there you go.  </p><p>The way I'm spending my time, the Title 10 Abortion Provider Prohibition Act, when I chaired the Select investigative panel, looking into what was happening with Planned Parenthood. One of the--you know, in the videos, and then we came up, figured out they were selling baby body parts, what we did was to put in place legislation that backs up what the President has done by executive order. It simply says this, \"Title 10 funding will go to its stated statutory all purpose, which is to clinics that provide women's health care, and if you provide abortion services, you're not going to get that.\" So-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>But the Title 10 Prohibition and the Protecting Life and Taxpayers Act, these two pieces of legislation, two of the first things that I did in coming to the Senate, because stating that we are, indeed, here to protect life and Liberty. Oh, yeah. What was that, the first thing? Life. So those are our first two--two things that we have worked on. Third, last month, I found the Campus Free Speech Resolution of 2019. This is-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>--this is--you are so welcome. And I've talked with a lot of college students. You know, it's inconceivable to us that in this day and age that having diversity of thought would be considered to be harmful, and that students and professors are arguing about encouraging people to hear different points of view. So we have this, and it backs up many of our conservative--conservative groups.  </p><p>The fourth thing, in Judiciary Committee we are doing hearings in addressing social media bias. And I am going to chair a working group in the Senate Judiciary Committee that will look at the issues of privacy, data security, antitrust, and online censorship. We think this-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>It's important that we hold these online platforms accountable, and that they move away from subjectively manipulating those algorithms that boot out--that boot out conservative speech.  </p><p>Number five, judicial confirmations. How do you like these new federal judges?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Isn't that great? So far, we have confirmed 123 federal judges, and in Judiciary Committee today, we moved for more out to go to the floor. So President Trump has set quite a record on this and we really--we really do support what he's doing.  </p><p>Number six, defending Israel.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>This is Senate Bill 1, passed early this year and item number seven on my list, fighting BDS.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And Senate Resolution 120.  </p><p>Number eight, defending Christians in Sri Lanka, important that we weighed in on that.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Number nine is something we're continuing to work on even today, keeping maximum pressure on Iran-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>--and making certain that we support the President when he put the sanctions in place. Iran's economy is beginning to crumble. And don't let anybody tell you this is a new problem; this has been going on since the 70s. And we know that Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism. And I thought it was interesting, The Washington Post even reported that Hezbollah was complaining that Iran had cut off some of their money flow, so Hezbollah couldn't carry out their bad deeds. So we're going to keep the pressure on.  </p><p>And number 10 is one that we have just done today, the National Defense Authorization Act, making certain that our men and women in uniform have what they need to carry out the job that they're supposed to do.  </p><p>Thank you all so much for letting me be with you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>PURTILL: Hello, everyone. I'm Patrick Purtill. I'm Director of Legislative Affairs for the Faith and Freedom Coalition and it is my distinct pleasure to introduce your next speaker. I think probably all of you will know him already, but let me say a few words.  </p><p>U.S. Senator Mike Lee was first elected to the Senate in 2010, since then, he has been as he was before coming to the Senate, he's been a leader on all of the issues that we care about. He is a--he was an--an accomplished attorney in private practice, a Supreme Court litigator before he came here, so it's no surprise that he landed on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where you have probably seen him in some made for TV specials, like the Gorsuch hearings and the Kavanaugh hearings, which were all great sport.  </p><p>He has been a leader on a number of issues here. He's a leader on pro-life issues. He's a leader on religious liberty issues here in the Senate. We have worked and have been particularly excited to work with him on a lot of criminal justice issues, which President Trump spoke about yesterday, and Matthew Charles, also spoke to you a little bit about the first step act and what--what that has accomplished. None of that, that act would not have been possible without Senator Lee's leadership on the committee, both his commitment to the issue and to fixing where their disproportionalities in the system, in the criminal justice system, the prison system, his commitment to that has been steadfast since he's been elected. But it was really not just his commitment to it, but his really smart approach to it, he made sure that it was a bipartisan bill, that it was able to come out of the Judiciary Committee, head to the--to the Senate floor, and ultimately, to President Trump's desk. So please--please join me in welcoming Senator Mike Lee.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>LEE: Thank you. I never ever get people standing for me when I enter a room in this town. So this is unusual for me.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>When that happens, I look around And I think they must be applauding for someone else. It's so great to be back with you. I love this organization. I love each of you. I love what you do. I love even the name of the organization, the Faith and Freedom Coalition. These are two concepts that define America. And they're two things that cannot exist one without the other, you can't truly be free without faith, and you cannot truly exercise faith without freedom. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So in that respect, your organization does exactly what we as Americans do so well, balancing faith with freedom, making sure that they both exist, so that either can exist and when either can exist, so can the other. These are things that are easy to take for granted and sometimes people do take them for granted. But we have to remember, that for most of human history, prior to America's founding, a free conscience was not seen as a fundamental, unmitigated good, it was seen, rather, as a threat.  </p><p>From ancient tribes, to modern empires, governments saw fit to subject the City of God to the City of Man. This state decided, in most instances, what consisted of acceptable religion and it punished whatever was not dissenters were punished and so we're worshippers of just about every stripe. Fortunately, our founders saw a better way. Fortunately, our--our founders envisioned America, the kind of America that we would later become, the kind of America that we still are, then that I hope we always will be. That is, as Americans we're great, not because of who we are, but because of what we do. You see, both faith and freedom are the consequence of a choice. We must choose every day of our lives to be free, we must choose every day of our lives to have faith. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So our founding fathers set up a system that would protect both. It was one of the things that they did that was so bold, and so brave, nearly two and a half centuries ago. I've talked for a long time and written extensively about our Constitution and recently, I came to believe that there's another document that's sometimes not appreciated as much as it should be, the Declaration of Independence. It's often been said-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Yes, I thank you. I'm glad there's some-- It sometimes has been said that the Constitution provides the frame for our freedom, the frame as in around a picture, the structure. But the picture itself is painted by the Declaration of Independence. It's one of the reasons why I recently wrote a book about the Declaration of Independence. It's called Our Lost Declaration. All 12 people who have read Our Lost Declaration have absolutely loved it. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I encourage you to become the 13th today.  </p><p>But what they did when they sent their name to that document was, in fact, treason. It was an act of open resistance against not only their own king, their own country, but what was then the world's last standing and greatest superpower. They truly pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. We have to ask ourselves from time to time, why did they do it? Was it worth it? They did it, of course, because of their love of their fellow beings. They recognized what I hope each and every one of us will always be willing to recognize, that is the eternal worth and immortal, immeasurable import of every human soul, that having been created in the image of God, we are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity, and we must treat each other that way every day. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>One of my favorite Frenchman of all times, Alexis de Tocqueville, understood that our religion, our belief in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, even the Lord God, Jesus Christ, was the source of our strength. As he toured America and tried to explain why it is that the revolution had stuck here, why it is that it worked here, that why it was that we were allowed and able to be free and equally treated under a fair, just system of laws. He explained as follows, \"Freedom regards religion as the companion in all its battles and all its triumphs as the very cradle of its infancy and the source of all its claims, because religion alone is the safeguard of morality and morality is the best ensures pledge for the survival of freedom.\" </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We managed as a country to hold on to these emblems, these remembrances, these reminders of the fact that what makes us great is the choice we make every day to follow our God. It's been said, I believe by Winston Churchill, that, \"We shape our buildings and then our buildings shape us.\"  </p><p>As I take the time to give constituents from my state or around the country tours of this great building, I'm often drawn to a couple of pieces of artwork that often go unnoticed. Both were made by an Italian born immigrants to the United States who were hired on as artists for the decoration of the capital. One was by Enrico Causici, who made this great sculpture that often goes unnoticed. It currently stands in Statuary Hall, also known as the former House Chamber.  </p><p>Liberty in the Eagle consists of a figure, I believe, representing liberty, with her right arm outstretched holding a scroll, most likely representing the Constitution. To her right is an eagle, representing farseeing vision and--and strength. To her left is a fasces, a bundle of sticks representing E Pluribus Unum, representing the fact that we're greater we're stronger than the sum of our parts. Normally, a fasces is held together by leather straps, by ropes, or by cords of some sort. In this instance, the fasces is held together by a snake.  </p><p>I was alarmed by the sculpture when I first got here, I didn't know what to make of it, until someone explained to me a hypothesis that perhaps, maybe just maybe, this is channeling the words of Jesus from Matthew Chapter 10, verse 16, admonishing Jesus's followers to be wise as serpents, but harmless as doves. You see, we have to trust and love your neighbor, but also cut the cards. Could it have been that the founders of our great country, including those who adorned its public buildings in the early part of our Republic, understood this great truth, that the Republican form of government, any form of government that recognizes is freedom, and protects and professes the right to believe in Almighty God as each person deems appropriate, is itself wonderful and very fragile, is at once the source of our strength, and our biggest potential vulnerability?  </p><p>Another one of these sculptures represented the same thing can be found at the opposite end of the building, I'm a senate wing in something called the Brumidi Corridor. The artists there, Constantino Brumidi, displays a cherub surrounded on one side by a snake, and the other side by a dove. We have to remember the important choice to be wise as serpents, but harmless as doves every single day. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And so I hope we can choose every day to maintain the strength of our Republic, to do so by choosing virtue, by making the choice between right and wrong and choosing to interact with each other in a way that properly reflects all of Jesus' teachings, including those to love one another. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I bear testimony that God lives, that He is aware of and loves each and every one of us, that Jesus is the Christ, that He, in fact, died for us, that He paid the price for our sins, that He suffered for all humanity so that we might be free and we might return to live with him once again. I bear that testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>HEAD: So we'll let--another day we'll have Senator Lee, the constitutional expert explain why someone like that is legally allowed to say something like that in a building like this.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So this--hopefully, this is--this is encouraging to you. It's informational. It's--its current, I mean, literally off of the senate floor. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>The--you know, like--like Senator Blackburn alluded to earlier, we do it in a hotel, large crowd, big stage and stuff, but we--we really--I really love having this--this element, because I--I  think that it--not only does it allow us to be able to come into our capital, but honestly, it allows elected officials, like you just heard, to kind of lay it out right here in--in front of--of everybody, that this is--this is who we are, this is what we believe, this is what we stand for and--and we're not checking--checking that at the door, right.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So speaking of not checking anything at the door, any Oklahomans, family--family, friends of Oklahomans? We got an Oklahoman on the front row over here. So that--that is God's country. And this is hard--hard as a--as a native Texan for me to--to say this, but God's country, but it's easier for me to say because he's married to a former Baylor Bear.  </p><p>And as you heard earlier, when I talked about Dr. Paul, the--the--I think one of the Clarion voices in American politics on these issues is our next speaker, background as a minister that I--I think I'll tell you a little bit about, but he has influenced, truly influenced the lives of an entire generation of Oklahomans, really, throughout the Midwest for that matter. But--but he was a--he worked in youth ministry for years and years. And--and after interacting, literally, with hundreds of thousands over the years of high school and college students, Senator Lankford realized that the--that the time is now, and the calling is here to--to come to Washington.  </p><p>Several years ago, as a member of the United States House of Representatives, James Lankford moved in and became a staunch and reliable voice on these issues and the last couple of years, he's taken that voice across Capitol Hill into the Senate. So would you join me in welcoming our friend, Senator James Lankford, from Oklahoma? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>LANKFORD: Well, see. No need to stand and clap and just unless you need to stand in stretch. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Be able to go.   </p><p>\\So let--me let me clarify something on this God's Country issue. In Oklahoma, we have more barbecue restaurants in Oklahoma than any other state in America per capita.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>Okay, so I--I--I--lots of other folks say they have great barbecue and I--I--I'm, \"Okay, fine. Come eat ours and you'll know the difference.\" But I--I--I joke with folks all the time that as--as you read through the Old Testament, it always talks about the sweet aroma of the sacrifice coming up. And I always say that even God likes the smell of barbecue.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So it is--it is--it is one of those things that is always special for-- </p><p>My--my background is as he was mentioning, it was in ministry. I was 22 years in ministry, and served in youth ministry, and depending on your background with your own personal youth minister, to know that a youth pastor is a senator either encourages you or terrifies you, probably-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--Depending on your own personal relationship with your youth pastor. </p><p>I never expected to be in Congress. This was not in our life plan. This is what my wife calls life's greatest interruption. But in 2008, my wife and I, separately, since God calling us to be able to run for Congress, and we spent about seven months telling God what a really insane idea that was. And saying over and over again, \"That's not rational. That's not possible,\" Because I was a voter, I was engaged in the issues, I was passionate about what was happening in our country, but I spent all my time working with students.  </p><p>I directed what--some of you may have heard of the False Creek Youth Camp, I was the director of the False Creek Youth Camp. It's the largest Christian camp in America. We have 5,000 students a week there. It is a very unique place to be able to do ministry. And if you're in youth ministry and you have the opportunity to be able to work with 51,000 students a summer you take that. And that's my joy to be able to do that.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>But in 2008, and 09, God was very clear with us to say, \"I want you to do something different.\" And honestly, when we started bragging about it, I really thought this was going to be an--an Isaac/Abraham kind of moment, that God was going to say, \"Be faithful and pray about it, go up to Mount Moriah, but at the end, there's the ram, you don't have to kill your career.\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But we got to Mount Moriah and he said, \"No kill it. We're going to do something different.\" And at the end of that, we finally had to get to the point to say, \"I'm going to be an old man one day telling my grandchildren about the time I didn't follow God. This is what God is calling us to do and I don't know why, but we're going to go do it.\" </p><p>Now, I tell you that story because it's not about us, it's about what God has done. But I'm also convinced that I meet people all the time, that they say, \"My family doesn't have any background in politics. I don't have any background in politics. I don't have any money, like all these other folks do. There's no way that I can ever get involved in that, but God.\" </p><p>AUDIENCE: But God.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>LANKFORD: So my simple statement to some of you, some of you are here because you're grassroots activists, and you're excited about helping someone else and what you're really doing is disobeying God, because he's telling you not to help someone else, he's telling you to do it, and you're short circuiting what he's calling you to do. Complete what he's calling you to do. Now, I can't call you, that's not my responsibility. But some of you are not supposed to be helping, you're supposed to be doing, you're supposed to be on the school board, you're supposed to be on the city council-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>--you're supposed to be engaged in these issues. I don't know what that is for you. But I would encourage you to not be afraid to follow where God leads you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Don't be afraid to go there.  </p><p>I have folks all the time that say, \"I'm grateful that there are good people that are in Washington, DC, because they'll change the country.\" I will typically smile at them and say politely, \"Washington doesn't change the country, the country changes Washington. That's how it works.\"  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So the grassroots activists, the people that are engaged in the issues that are actually changing the culture, and that's the family, and the church, and the communities, and the nonprofits that are actually changing culture and engaging, that moves slowly to DC, and it moves slowly out of DC. So the transitions that we need to see in DC 10 years from now will happen because churches, and communities, and families are engaging in their local communities now and that will slowly make it. What's happening in DC right now, culturally, is a result of what happened in our country 10 years ago. What would you like to see DC like 10 years from now? Transition your communities, engages the church, activate and real dialogue and conversation, and that's what DC will be like 10 years from now. It takes some time. But that's actually the way that it actually moves.  </p><p>Now, there are a lot of critical issues we're working on right now that are exceptionally important to us, those of us who believe in basic freedom, and not everyone up here does. One of my colleagues just two weeks ago made a public statement to say people that are pro-life are like racist and anti-Semites, there's no place for them in America.  </p><p>AUDIENCE: Wow.  </p><p>LANKFORD: And when she made a statement that pro-life individuals, that there is no place for them in America because they're like racists and anti-Semites, she laid down a gauntlet to say, \"This is what we believe. We're going to do whatever we can do to silence those of you that believe in the value of children. We will make sure that your voice does not get out there.\" Because I can't imagine anything worse in America than racism, antisemitism, and children, can you? It's a really odd list to be in, isn't it? For those of you that love the life of a child, to be considered as the group that there is no place for them anymore in America. The way that turns around is not a vote, that's heart issue and that's the engagement that well have to do culturally in conversations.  </p><p>Right now on--on university campuses, and all this fall, there will be students standing and screaming in the face of people that they disagree with because they disagree with them and they're going to work to silence their voice to make sure they cannot speak. It's a cultural issue. That's an engagement about what is right and what's wrong and what we value. We turn that around, not with a vote, we turn that around with individual engagement. Now, there are things like judges that we can work on here. We've got to be able to get good judges in place, people that actually read the law, and crazy enough, follow the law. I know that's a radical concept to some.  </p><p>We've got to get great judges in place and we're working on that. In fact, the Senate reached a point just a few months ago, that we reached the boiling point to say, \"We're going to actually change the rules of the Senate,\" and I had the joy of leading the effort to be able to shift the rules in the Senate because my Democratic colleagues were blocking every good judge that was coming through and so we shifted the rules of the Senate to say, \"It doesn't matter who this judge is, if they are qualified we need to be able to move them through.\" And we have doubled the number of judges that we're doing now in this basis now, to be able to accelerate that. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>That is exceptionally important for us to be able to do, because we're not looking for judges with a certain opinion, other than their opinion is the law, follow that. We're not looking for certain bias, we're not looking for certain preference towards our point of view, just follow the law and we'll try to do the same. It's the most basic aspect that we can do in culture. Now, there's lots of things that we can work on, they provide religious liberty, and they provide engagement, our community, but there is no substitute for us engaging with our neighbors.  </p><p>So let me just say this thing to you, thank you for coming here and for encouraging members of Congress and our staff in the test that we're doing, because seeing you is an encouragement to us to be able to keep going, to be able to know there's people in my state in Oklahoma, God's country, as you've already heard-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--that are passionate about trying to do the right thing the right way. But it's good to know there's folks from all over the country that are also doing that. But again, there is no substitute for just having that dialogue at home, with family, with friends, with neighbors, and not having an expectation that if I elect somebody, they'll go do my job. I have a job, so do you. Let's go follow God together, and to see how we can serve our country and our neighbors, and to see where this takes us in the days ahead. Is that I can deal with you? Let's go do it together. Thanks for engaging. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>REED: Now, if--if you ever, for even a second, think that what you do, to pray and work, to see God glorified in the Civic arena, if you think it doesn't make a difference, I want you to think about what you just heard. It makes a difference. I can tell you, when I came here to Washington and worked in the Senate, I'm not going to say how many years ago it was, 37-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--there wasn't anybody in the Senate like him. And now I think it would be fair to say there are a good number.  </p><p>LANKFORD: There are several, yeah.  </p><p>REED: And we are--we are fortunate to have a man like this in the U.S. Senate fighting for us every single day. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And it is--it is a bit of a cliche to say doing the Lord's work in the Devil City, but in this case, it applies.  </p><p>LANKFORD: It is true, yeah.  </p><p>REED: And he has generously agreed to stay and take a few questions. So anybody have a question for Senator Lankford? I think we're getting handheld mics right here. Patrick, we have one right here. </p><p>LANKFORD: This is my moment as a pastor, I get to say, yes, I see that hand. I see that hand.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Yes, yes, yes, I see that hand. </p><p>QUESTION: Yeah. Thank you so much Senator Lankford. Roman Buhler with Madison Coalition.  </p><p>President Trump talked in his inaugural address about taking power out of Washington and giving it back to the people. What are some of your ideas about how we can take power out of Washington permanently and give it back to the States and the people? </p><p>LANKFORD: So it is a great challenge, because the Executive Branch, over the decades, has been given authority by Congress and the Executive Branch only gives that authority up if the Executive Branch chooses to. Because once the Executive Branch has the power, you have to have a vote of the House, Senate, and the signature of a president to take it away. That's the catch. It's a easy to give power away, it is very difficult to be able to take it back.  </p><p>So here's what President Trump is actively doing right now, he's working on the regulatory side, he made a commitment to say for every one new regulation that goes in, two are going to come out. Why is that significant? He's not trying to create chaos in the country, he's trying to say we're over managed as a country, where there's a federal bureaucrat trying to look over our shoulder on everything. So one reg in, two out was a way that he was taking it seriously to say, \"Let's try to start managing this.\" He actually failed at doing that, I have to tell you, the first year, he didn't do one in, two out, he did one in twenty-two out his first year. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So you'll--you'll hear--you'll hear--hear people say, \"The regulatory state's coming down and so businesses getting more active and there's--there's more authority back to citizens to be able to make decisions.\" That's what that really looks like. Again, it's not trying to create chaos, it's trying to say we should trust each other as neighbors. Now, there--we do need to have some basic boundaries, but trust is important as a community like ours. So-- </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, sir, for standing for the Lord and being here.  </p><p>And I felt like one of the questions I wanted to ask is that I want people to pray for our leaders. What are the top things that we can pray for you and your family and the colleagues? Because that's so important that we stand with you in prayer and surround you in prayer. </p><p>LANKFORD: Bless you for that.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So let me give you a couple quick things to be able to pray for us on. My wife and I of 27-years, we have two daughters, this is a place that grinds up families because I'm on the road all the time. So I leave my wife, not really leave, that sounds horrible, so I fly away on Monday mornings.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>How about that? I get on a plane and fly away from home because in my--my vernacular, home is where your wife is. And so I fly away on Monday mornings, I'm here all week, I fly home on Thursday or Friday, typically, each week, home on the weekend, will travel around the state, then I'll get back again. That's tough. Everybody that does that they--they know that's stuff, so pray for families that are here.  </p><p>The second aspect, I--I prayed the prayer of Nehemiah. Nehemiah heard God's call to go govern, basically, when he wasn't a governing person, he was a--a slave, a cup bearer slave. But he prayed very specifically, he said, \"God, I need favor with that person.\" It was in other words, \"You've told me to do something, I cannot do it unless you give me favor to accomplish that.\" So praying for people of faith that are here and say, \"God, would you give them favor with people?\" And you see that over and over again in Scripture, where God raised people up, gave them favor to accomplish what needs to be done, even with people that wouldn't typically give favor to.  </p><p>So that's the--that's the second one. The third one is pretty straightforward as well. Our lives are so cluttered here with so many distractions. Every time you walk down the hall the media is asking you to work on what they want you to work on. \"Are you working on this? Are you working on this? Are you working on this?\" What they're trying to do is distract all the time to the stuff they care about? Having a focus on what is supposed to be done, not the shiny object of the day is really key for any of us that do this task. Does that help? Yep. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi, how are you? My name is Dylan Lyons (SP). I'm a student from South Texas, and I'm a young person, only 22. So I don't remember the old days-- </p><p>LANKFORD: --I have a the a 22-year-old daughter, by the way. </p><p>QUESTION: Oh, well, does she have a phone number?  </p><p>LANKFORD: No. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>QUESTION: I assure you, I'm a good church boy. </p><p>LANKFORD: I'm going to have to see more resume than that, yeah.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>QUESTION: Well, that's my question, actually. So because I'm young, I don't remember what it was like 10 years ago, 20 years ago, you have seen the progression of the intersection of faith and politics on our nation, for at least your adult life, if is not, probably, your childhood.  </p><p>LANKFORD: Sure.  </p><p>QUESTION: And now that you have left and--oh, you're still in the ministry, of course-- </p><p>LANKFORD: --I'm still in the ministry, yeah.  </p><p>QUESTION: Right. You're now actively working in politics. I feel in my heart that this is a critical time, a very important time, a time that it's--it's--it's--this is a time 100 years from now, in our nation's books, it will be read as one of the most critical moments in our nation's history. </p><p>LANKFORD: Yes, I agree.  </p><p>QUESTION: Now,  am I crazy for thinking that?  </p><p>LANKFORD: No, you're not. You're--you're actually growing into manhood in a moment that is unfamiliar 50 years ago, or 30 years ago, or even 10 years ago. And let me--let me give you some illustrations of that. It wasn't that long ago Bill Clinton was president and he had a huge issue on the campaign trail, because they found out that he one time smoked marijuana. And so he said, \"But I didn't inhale--\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--because he was like, \"Oh my gosh, this could blow up my whole campaign because I didn't inhale.\" Now we have 30 states that have legalized marijuana, it's totally different. It wasn't that long ago that Barack Obama was running for president and he was asked about gay marriage and he said, \"I'm opposed to gay marriage. Now, I'm okay with civil unions, but not gay marriage.\" That was Barack Obama, when he was running for president in 2008. Now our culture is dramatically shifted. It wasn't that long ago that was assumed what a religious liberty meant. Now, if you say, \"I stand for religious liberty,\" they say, \"That's LGBT bigotry is what you mean by that. That's code word for that.\" There's an enormous shift that's happened just in our vernacular and in our conversation.  </p><p>We're as a people, we love God and love people but we're being put into a box and being pressed in on every side. And so even the dialogue that I have about loving God, about loving people, about standing for religious liberty, about all those things, the--the culture is trying to define a way, \"You're that person, you're that person.\" And--and even not that long ago, pre-iPhone, which is not that long ago, pre-Facebook, which is not that long ago, people didn't just randomly scream at strangers. Now people get online and randomly scream at strangers. That's a real cultural shift that has occurred.  </p><p>So I--I find this shocking statement to be true, scripture is still true-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>--speaking the truth in love, living out those biblical principles is more stark than ever. And even in the issue of marriage, Paul wrote to a society and was teaching a society about marriage in his--in all of his writings, and was constantly reaffirming marriage because that was such a radical concept in that Roman culture. Fidelity, who does that in a Roman culture? So he was calling them out to be able to live in such a radical way that they demonstrated their faith.  </p><p>A simple illustration, Peter and his writing, First Peter, Chapter Two, where he says, \"I pray that--\" he's calling the believers, aliens and strangers and they all live such good lives among the pagans, \"So if they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God.\" It was a transformation, not based on the culture, you're safe in that culture. He was writing to a group of people saying, \"You're not safe in this culture. So how are you going to live so that the culture is transformed?\" It's just a decision you have to make, it is different, though.  </p><p>What else?  </p><p>UNKNOWN: Senator, one more?  </p><p>LANKFORD: Okay. Sure.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: Okay.  </p><p>LANKFORD: I can hang out with this crowd all day. This is fun. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. I'm Beth Kilmer (SP) from Tallahassee, Florida. And-- </p><p>LANKFORD: --Ma'am, it sounds like you're from Tallahassee, Florida.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I love, love that accent. </p><p>QUESTION: I've heard that before.  </p><p>LANKFORD: Come on. </p><p>QUESTION: I have a question that is a little different, but I want to know how you and the administration and maybe your colleagues feel about the situation with the education system, the way it is, what our children are being taught, what horrifies us as parents knowing what is being taught? What are your thoughts on maybe moving away from the public classroom and parents forming not--I guess you could say homeschool groups that are backed up by churches or other organizations that give them the support to give the students the education they need but the parents have control and-- </p><p>LANKFORD: --Yeah.-- </p><p>QUESTION: --and it becomes their child, their way. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>LANKFORD: Yeah, do it. So let me make just a couple of quick statements on this. The vast majority of our students in America are educated in public schools, we should not back away and just surrender those, because that is a dramatic shift that happens in culture.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We should engage in making sure public school education is the best possible again, but the best way to do that is not to run it from this city. This city is a worst-case scenario to try to be able to run it. And I get--I--I think it's really funny, when I--I heard some of the debate from last time they were talking about, \"Well, Washington, DC should do that.\" I thought, \"Washington DC folks are the same as everybody else. Okay, it's not like there's some unique breed that lives in ultra-intelligent Washington DC, is just folks.\"  </p><p>Putting education as close to that child, as close to the parent as possible is the secret sauce in this. because if somebody's in DC, 2000 miles away is the one that's actually watching out for your kid, no one's watching out for your kid. If you put educational control as close as you possibly can, those parents can gather together in saying, \"How come this classroom is not working out? How come it's not engaged?\" But all the authority is somewhere else, then that's always going to be a problem.  </p><p>So we passed, actually, several years ago, a shift from No Child Left Behind, which was a very DC focused educational experiment, to be able to shift to what's called Every Student Succeeds, to shift the authority making. It's one of those, as we were talking about before, The Wall Street Journal called it the largest release of powerful from Washington DC in decades, where the authority for decision-making for education shifted back to the States. So I encourage anyone on education with that passion, to go to your state capitol and say, \"We have the authority to make decisions now on education, let's do a shift.\"  </p><p>One of the big changes that occurred in a cultural basis and in a civics related, was we stopped testing for history and civics so the focus was on math and science and--and reading, those are great disciplines to have, but we left one out, history and civics. When you don't test for that you don't teach to that if that's not a high priority. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So in our--in our public education, when public schools stopped focusing on education in that area, we lost track of our history and our background, because it was de-emphasized, that is a problem for us culturally. And now people can look back and say, \"Our founding fathers were not all that great, and they were terrible. And our--socialism has just never been tried the way that we're could do socialism. And so socialism and capitalism are basically equivalent.\" And all these different concepts come up because of just a lack of history in the background, right. So that's--we shouldn't surrender the--the public school side of it.  </p><p>But coming from Oklahoma, with a very high percentage of homeschooled kids in Oklahoma, in fact, in our state constitution home schools are written in as a protection in our state constitution when were formed as a state, it's a very big deal for us. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>Christian education, private education, homeschool education should all be protected entities and there are ways to be able to do that. Ted Cruz has been fantastic on this issue, on trying to be able to work through on 529s for homeschool education, that you could use that for college or homeschool or private school. All those are great ideas and things that we can do up here, but ultimately, it still boils down to communities of parents taking responsibility for their own kids. I still come back to the same basic concept that we have, parents have the first responsibility for the education their kids and once you surrender that, even in a biblical sense, or an education sense, you've surrendered a lot. And so the engagement that we have as parents in the education of our children there is--there just is no substitute for that.  </p><p>So bless you. Keep going. And let's just keep cooperating together on it. Yeah, thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So, let we take one more? Okay, I just got the one more sign. Sorry, Ralph. Balcony, balcony, balcony. Okay. Wait. Go ahead.  </p><p>(OFF MIC) </p><p>LANKFORD: That's great. Then I'm going to this question because I know somebody's right over there, too. </p><p>So her question if you couldn't hear it, was how is Washington working with human trafficking? Operations like Operation Underground Railroad and other folks that are trying to identify. There's actually been quite a few bills. If you can connect with our team I can actually send you the full list of some of the things that we've done, not only in funding, but in different, what's called authorizing language, to continue to be able to work to partner together with individual ministries, with nonprofits, with states, with law enforcement training, identifying those that are victims of trafficking.  </p><p>One of the things I just talked to Customs and Border Patrol about that they've been trained on a couple of years ago was identifying people that are being trafficked into the country, being able to see them at airports, in shipyards, in places to be able to identify those, they have specialized training and an emphasis to be able to do that at our border ports of entry. That's very significant. And their story that's as quickly as, was I heard it yesterday, so it happened on Wednesday, of where they redeemed a Russian woman that was being slipped and that was being trafficked into the United States for sex trafficking. So this--this is happening in a regular basis.  </p><p>One of the things that I would say to you, on this on the issue of human trafficking, we need, if you're working in a ministry of that area, I'm encouraging ministries to have a broader focus. When we talk about drug trafficking, you'll hear people talk about supply and demand, that we're never going to deal with the supply issue of drugs until we deal with the demand issue of drugs, right? When we talk about sex trafficking that never comes up. And I think it's a reasonable question to say why aren't we talking about supply and demand on sex trafficking as well? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>That is a challenge to be able to push back--that's a challenge to be able to push back on a cultural issue, to say culturally, we're not addressing why are so many men buying young boys and buying women and buying all these area for trafficking? Why is that happening in our culture and what are we doing to re-engage with that? Again, that's not something we can vote to solve, that's something we can just bless and encourage and make sure no one's in the way, but empower nonprofits, and churches, and communities to be able to engage in some of that.  </p><p>Somebody right over here had one more question or two.  </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you so much, Senator. </p><p>There's been a lot of talk today about Supreme Court nominees, Justice Kavanaugh and--and Gorsuch most notable. To what extent can you and your conservative colleagues in the Senate and the House push-back against traditional supremacy, specifically on abortion. Everyone, we--we March For Life every year, and there's--there's a lot of talk about waiting for Roe v Wade to be overturned, but what can you do to call on President Obama to reject Roe v Wade and put an end to the daily slaughter? </p><p>LANKFORD: Yeah, so bless you in that even so come. I--I--I wrote a--a Newsweek editorial, that actually was published this week, about life. And we put it in Newsweek, obviously, to be able to reach that audience in that location. But one of the things I made a statement and my closing statement was, \"We as a--we as a nation cannot believe that there was a time we called people three-fifths of a man. We can't believe there was a time when we told women they couldn't vote.  </p><p>We can't believe, as a society, there was a time that we interned people during World War II just because they were Japanese and their skin color. We can't believe that there was a time that we used to sell people in the marketplace. I can't believe that we did that as a nation. And I believe there will be a day in the days ahead, that we will look back on this time period and say, 'I can't believe we used to kill children just for convenience. I can't believe we used to do that.'\" </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Keeping--keeping the conversation about the child, I think is extremely important. And every time we have a conversation about abortion that focus should be on a child that's there. We're not talking about just a women's--a woman's right to choose, there are two people there and half the time there are two women there. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So we've got to be able to make decisions on what is the best decision right now for two people in this, not just the choice of one over the other. In our--in our society, we don't just cast people aside because they're inconvenient to me, we engage because we value every single life. And when someone has 10 fingers and 10 toes and a beating heart and DNA that is different than the mom or the dad that's a different life.  </p><p>Now, saying all that, let--let me say this, the legislature never added in those abortion issues. Prior to 1973 this was all decided by the states. That was a constitutional issue that was given to the states and very few states allowed abortion at that time period, but it was a state to state conversation prior to Roe v. Wade. The court actually created this issue that it is going to be a right and they invented this new right to be able to push out to every single state. That was a court decision. So I've often said there's lots of things we can do legislatively. Ultimately, this is going to be a court decision for the court to be able to review. It was the biggest fear of all the changes that you--you can remember in the court and of voting, when Harry Reid did the nuclear option and changed the way that we actually changed rules in the Senate.  </p><p>Remember, at that time, they changed the number that was needed for every single office or every single night money except Supreme Court. They left Supreme Court at 60. And the reason they left Supreme Court in 60, is because they knew there would be a day they would lose the Senate and they felt like if they kept Supreme Court and 60 they would never get a right to life judge, they would always have enough to protect the Supreme Court from getting a right to life judge. That's the reason that's behind that whole decision.  </p><p>So the focus that we have right now on judges, whether it be District Court, circuit courts, and Supreme Courts is not asking them a litmus test, just asking them, \"How do you read the law?\" Because we believe that if you look flat at the law, at what the law actually says and what the Constitution actually says, there are certain rights that are reserved to the States and those rights need to be preserved by the states. And there are certain rights that are given to the federal government and responsibilities of the federal government, and  that we as a federal government should only do those things. So our goal is to find judges that stick close to the law. And our belief is if you have judges that stick around the law, they're also going to interpret the law in the value of every single life, not just a life once they reach a certain height, because I don't believe it's a person once there's such and such height, I believe a person is a person, is a person, is a person, and I think our law will be consistent with that.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Is that fair? Yeah. Hey, y'all. Come on bro. For some of y'all I'm going to have the opportunity to be able to be with you on Saturday night for those of y'all that are going to be at the dinner with Bill Bennett, to be able to honor him Saturday night. I might be able to bump into you because my wife will be with me, she'll be the much prettier, what I call my other three force, in--in my life. And so, hopefully, we'll get a chance to be able to visit somewhat in the hallway around dinner on Saturday night, but that pretty lady with me will be Cindy and so get a chance to be able to come up and just say hello. Thanks for being here. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>REED: God bless you. Thank you. </p><p>I want to--I want to share something with you that I think will speak to you after what you just heard. You know, you look at people like David Perdue, and Marco Rubio, and James Lankford, and Ted Cruz, I can't name everybody, but there--there is a Bible study here in the Senate, there's a Bible study in the Cabinet, and the other day, I can't remember where we were, but we were at some event, and former Senator Sam Brownback, who is now the Ambassador for Religious Freedom at the State Department told me, he said, \"Ralph, I can't walk 20 feet at the White House, here on Capitol Hill, or in any cabinet department building, without running into somebody who is A, a committed believer, and B, somebody I've worked with for at least 20 years in advancing our pro-family/pro-life agenda.\"  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So when the pro-family/pro-life movement first broke upon the beaches of our political system in the late 70s, and early 80s, and helped elect Ronald Reagan, nothing against the many find people who served him, Reagan was often the only conservative in the meeting. Okay, he was the only one and so we had to rely on him. Now, we have people all over this government. And I will tell you, as somebody who goes back to that time, there are more Christians serving in the cabinet, serving in the White House staff, in the sub-cabinet, in cabinet and agency staff, and he here on the Hill under this president, then all the previous presidents combined. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>That's what's happening. </p><p>And I and I--I--I tell people that and they say, \"I--you know, I didn't know that.\" So it's great that you heard President Trump say what he said yesterday on our stage. But let me tell you what you need to be praying for and about and being encouraged by, it isn't just that he's defending you and biblical values, it's that when a decision has to be made in this White House about whether or not to write regulations that defund Planned Parenthood under the title 10 program and ultimately, under Medicaid, the people who are writing memos and are in the meeting advising the President are on our side, more than ever before, more than ever before. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Is Josh here? Okay, I--Tim, do you want to introduce the Senator? I will--I'll call Tim Head, our executive director, up to introduce Senator Hawley. And by the way, isn't Tim and his team, aren't they doing an amazing job this week with this conference? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>HEAD: Is somebody keeping--keeping up with my steps today? My step counts. I--I lost track a little bit.  </p><p>Well, listen. So we've already heard from some people that have been--been doing this for a pretty long time, been a very effective. Y'all are also--you're well aware that--that Bill Bennett on Saturday night will be honoring for a lifetime of doing this kind of work. But truly, a lot of this work is--it is a torch passing exercise, that the--the future really meets the current right here in this building. </p><p>So, usually there's kind of a progression. That people you know over the course of five, six, ten years, that work in the state legislature, maybe a statewide elect--elected official, and a member of the Congress, a member of the Senate, etc. and-and there'll be a--a little while for people in our movement to learn--learn a new face and a new name. But occasionally, there will be a--a bit of a shooting star and our next visitor is actually one of those new shooting stars.  </p><p>So, coming out of the Midwest, which you know we just obviously heard from an Oklahoman. But any Missourian would challenge that they are the heartland of America. We--we have some Missourians with us, as a matter of fact. At least a quick-- a quick shout out to some of our friends right here in the third row. Since I--see some Missourians over here.  </p><p>But Senator Josh Hawley immediately landed when he was--when he was--elected to the Attorney General's office in Missouri. So, I do a good bit of work on human trafficking here and--and across the country. I mean within--within 100 days, he had re-oriented the Attorney General's office in the state of Missouri to--to aggressively monitor and--and ultimately prosecute predators in Missouri.  </p><p>Just last election cycle, I think there are a lot of people watching carefully of what was going to happen in Missouri and we were really, really excited when--when now Senator Hawley decided to--to go ahead and put his name in the hat to possibly serve in the United States Senate. So, he is already distinguished himself in a number of ways, and we are thrilled for the first time here at Faith and Freedom Coalitions Road to Majority Conference to join Senator Josh Hawley, from Missouri.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you, very much. Thank you, very much. Thank you. What a privilege it is to be here with you. I tell you what President Trump was swept into office by the men and women in this room. Isn't that right? I mean, you are the reason that he's here. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>And you're the reason I'm here. You understood the take--the stakes in 2016. You knew what Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party would do if they were given four more years. They would go absolutely crazy and you are right. We're seeing it over on the house side.  </p><p>I mean we are seeing over there the Democrats vision for the future of this country. Abortion on-demand, all the way up to birth. Heck, sometimes after birth. Outlawing the ability of people of faith to live, and work, and to follow our religious beliefs. Shutting down religious schools, and hospitals, and social welfare agencies. They even want to ban cows over on the whore--house side. Have you seen that? AOC's plan.  </p><p>I tell you as the Senator for the state of Missouri. I take personal offense of that. We really like cows in the state of Missouri. We like to save them. We like to save them for the grill.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>You know it's a great place.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thanks--thanks to you. We are not living in that extreme liberal version of America. Thanks to you. We are holding them off, but there is so much more work to do.  </p><p>What President Trump accomplished during his first two years in office is truly historic and that is especially true for those of us who are devoted to protecting life and securing our religious liberty. We have never had a president in my lifetime, who is this pro-life, this profamily, this pro-freedom, this pro-religious liberty. Do you agree with that? It's been  truly exceptional. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>You know the president--the president came and campaigned for me in Missouri. When I was running for election, just this last fall and he campaigned I think five different times. He came to Missouri.  </p><p>And he called me on election night, right after we found out that we won the election. My wife and I we're--we're going over to the party and I get a call and it's the president. And he gets on the phone and he says Josh, I have to tell you, you let me down. And I said the \"Oh.\" And so, I looked at my wife and you know she can kind of hear it and I said, \"The president said I let him down.\" And I said, \"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. President. I said, \"What--what are you talking about.\" And he said, \"Josh, you didn't even keep it close. Your election was supposed to be a nail biter. Instead, we one big. He said, \"You did fantastic.\"  </p><p>And that's because of him and it's because of you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And people like you. Standing up for our beliefs. Standing up for what we value. Refusing to be silenced. Refusing to be silenced. Refusing to be told no. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Much has been accomplished, in these first two years of the Trump Administration, but there is so much more to do. Because the swamp--I tell you what, the swamp may have been set back a little bit but I've been in the Senate for five months and I can tell you, the swamp is alive and kicking and waiting to rear its ugly head.  </p><p>You know the old ways work pretty well, for the powerful insiders, and for the political establishment and the problem was the establishment worked for progressive elites. In places like San Francisco or places like Manhattan, who are only too happy to shove their values down our throats. But the old ways that work so well, for people who we're from the heartland of this country. From the great middle of our society that built this nation, and that sustain this nation, that make us what we are.  </p><p>You know the rule in class here in DC, and in Silicon Valley, and in New York was getting more and more powerful, while we the people got left behind. And we finally decided to fight back and that's why President Donald Trump was elected. You said, \"enough is enough\" and so you know what? So, do I. </p><p>I haven't been in politics for long. I first ran for office in 2016. I'm a Constitutional Lawyer by trade and by training. My job was to fight for our religious liberties and to protect the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. But I tell you, I realized over time that trying to save the Constitution, case-by-case, just wasn't enough and that's why ran for Attorney General of the state of Missouri and that's why I ran for the United States Senate.  </p><p>And like President Trump, you know I got into politics to actually do something. Because I didn't imagine having a career in politics. I'm not here to make it a career of it. I'm actually here to do something and so you can count on me to speak my mind. And you know I'll tell you-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I'm the youngest member of the Senate. Tradition says that as a young member of the Senate, you're supposed to listen and not speak but I tell you what, there are some things that need to be said. Do you agree with that? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And there are some things that need to be done.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And in my short time in DC, I have sometimes upset the powers that be.  </p><p>AUDIENCE: Good. </p><p>HAWLEY: You know President Trump has shaken things up here in the swamp and I think we need more people who are going to do that. Do you agree with that? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Two areas--two areas I want to talk to you about particularly. Where we have to be especially vigilant and where the site is especially tough. And that is protecting our religious liberties, getting pro-Constitution judges on the bench-- </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yes. </p><p>HAWLEY: And the fight against Big Tech and their attempt to shut us down, to censor us, to stop our voices, to write us right out of the public square. These are big fights that we have to take on.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Now, I don't--I know I don't have to tell you about the importance judges. I'm on the Judiciary Committee. We have the responsibility to make sure the people to whom we give lifetime appointments, I mean they're on their forever. Lifetime appointments. That they understand that their job is not legislate from the bench. Their job is to uphold the Constitution of the United States, that we the people wrote.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And I tell you this. Before I was elected, I watched time and again leaders in both political parties, fail to apply this standard and as a result, you see what we've got now. Our core--courts are out of control. I mean look at the mess that this president inherited and look what they're 's trying to do now. We've we got judges--lifetime appointed judges in this country trying to block the president's clearly unlawful actions, defending our southern border. Trying to block the president now from putting a basic citizenship question on the United States census. That decision today from the United States Supreme Court isn't just a disappointment. It's just flat out wrong and-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I wish I could tell you--I wish I could tell you that the problem is only when the Democrats pick the judges. But you know what, over the years we've--we've had a few failures picked by Republicans too. Haven't we? I mean, let's be honest and they got confirmed because somebody in this building wasn't tough enough or brave enough to ask some tough questions. That's how it happened.  </p><p>You know President Trump is transforming the judiciary, but he cannot do it alone. He has got to have our help. We've got to stand up and be vigilant. We've got to be courageous. And I'm here to tell you that I'm going to say to every judge who come for me that I've got a vote on in my committee. I'm going to ask are they a pro-Constitution judges who will protect the Constitution United States, including the First Amendment to the Constitution United States, including our religious liberty.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>If they're not going to do it, they're not going to get my vote.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>It's that simple.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>In the last few weeks. Just in the last few weeks, we had a gentleman before us who the Democrats picked to fill a vacancy on the court. The federal court. Lifetime appointment in the state of Michigan. Maybe you read about this. He's a lot here who is representing a city in Michigan that had banned a faithful Catholic family from participating in city events. Why? Because the family operated a local farm, inconsistent with their beliefs.  </p><p>They only open farm to folks who wanted to get marriage consistent with their churches teaching and the Bible's teaching as I understand it on marriage and family. And in defense of the city, which banned these faithful Catholics from participating in city events. In defense of the city, this judicial nominee repeatedly compared this good Catholic family, these farmers, to KKK segregationists, to radical Islamic moms who want to take away all rights for women.  </p><p>He repeatedly said things like this on this, let me just quote. \"The plaintiffs\" that's the family--that's the family farmers \"Attempt to dress up their arguments in a simmering gown of First Amendment and religious righteousness and parade it down the runway of moral superiority. But when stripped of its costume, what lurks beneath is just discriminatory conduct.\" That's what he said about this Catholic family. Wanting to follow their beliefs, their churches teaching the Scripture. Does this sound to you like somebody who should be on the bench for a lifetime? </p><p>AUDIENCE: NO.  </p><p>HAWLEY: Well, I think so either. And I will tell you this that by the way he's not going to be.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We got his nomination stopped. He withdrew his name. He's not on the bench.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I promise you this. Whether you are from Missouri or not, I took an oath to defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States and I'm going to do that for every citizen. Because I'm accountable to every citizen for that oath that I took and I will tell you this right now, I'm going to that every nominee that comes before me carefully. I'm going to ask every nominee to support the Constitution and I don't care who doesn't like it and I don't care who's impatient with it.  </p><p>You know, the Wall Street Journal, nice newspaper. The Wall Street Journal has recently said that they're unhappy with me asking these kinds of questions about the First Amendment religious liberty. Oh yeah, they've--they've said--they've taken to print and said that they don't like it, and--and I respect the Wall Street Journal. I like the Wall Street Journal, but I got news, I don't work for the Wall Street Journal. I work for you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I work for the people who elected me, and my loyalty is to the Constitution of the United States. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Let me just say one other thing. We've got to get tough about confronting Big Tech. You know these companies based out in Silicon Valley have amassed more power than any companies we've seen in history since I don't know when. They've got all this power and they want to control the news that you get. They want to control what you're able to say to your friends and your family. They want to control the outcome of elections. Make no mistake about it, they want to control the flow of news and information to the American people so that they can control who gets elected in this country and who doesn't.  </p><p>And I for one am not willing to stand idly by while a bunch of unelected mega corporate titans who get handouts from this government tell us what to think. Tell us what to do and tell us who is going to be president. Do you agree with that?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I won't stand for it. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And nobody should. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>That's why I've introduce legislation that says if Big Tech wants to keep the special deals that they get from government and by the way they do get special deals. Google, Facebook, Twitter, they get treated differently by government, then any other platform. They're not treated like a newspaper. They're not treated like a TV station. They're not treated like FOXNews.com. They get a special deal. They get special immunity. You can't sue them or hold them accountable if they censor you. That's the deal that this government gave the Big Tech. Here's what I say, \"If they want to keep that deal. If they want to keep those special immunities. That's fine. Don't censor conservatives.\" </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>\"Don't violate the First Amendment.\" </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>On the other hand--on the other hand, if they want to be liberal companies and they want to push a progressive policy agenda and shove that down our throats, it's the United States of America. They're free--they're private companies. It's a free country. They can do what they want, but not with the help of government. Not with the help of our laws. We need to hold them accountable.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>You know, there's a lot more that we could talk about. There is so much more work to do. I want to end by thanking you for what you're doing on behalf of our country and on behalf of liberty. Thank you for caring enough to be leaders. Thank you for caring enough to invest your time and to investing resources. To pray for this country. To stand up and fight and do what you are doing.  </p><p>You know, I firmly believe that though our challenges are great and though the establishment is powerful and though the swamp is real. We can change this country. More accurately, we can save this country because you and I know that it is a country that is worth saving. It is a country worth standing up for. It is a country worth fighting for. It is a country worth renewing for the 21st century and together that is exactly what we're going to do. God bless you. Thanks, so much for having me. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>REED: Wow, this is something. Isn't it? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Now, do you know why we do what we do to turn out the vote?  </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yeah.  </p><p>I don't know is Judy--is Judy Kraft (SP) here? I saw her earlier. Is she here? Judy, do you mind if I tell the story about--was it your mother or somebody? Where you were there in Missouri and-- </p><p>KRAFT: (OFF-MIC) Yeah, I was talking to you.  </p><p>REED: Was it your mother?  </p><p>KRAFT: (OFF-MIC) Yes.  </p><p>REED: Okay. Do you mind if I tell the story? Or do you want to come up and tell the story?  </p><p>KRAFT: (OFF-MIC) No.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>REED: I'll pretend like I'm Donald Trump. Get up here.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Come on. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Isn't that great?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Bill Bennett (SP) served three presidents and never got the mic, you know?  </p><p>But anyway, Judy was telling me that she was visiting her mother in Missouri in the fall of 2018 and she was getting the mail out of her mailbox and when she went to the mailbox. There was our oversize yellow voter guide. Showing that Josh Hawley was pro-life, pro-religious freedom, pro-marriage, pro-Israel, and that Claire McCaskill was bad on everything. And by the way, isn't she just bad on everything? </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yes. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>HAWLEY: How did she ever even win an election in Missouri? Just--just palpable left-wing nonsense for that state and Judy said when I saw that coming to my mother in Missouri and then I knew what you--what we were doing in Georgia. Because she saw what we were doing in that governor's race. I felt really good.  </p><p>So, when we go out and we identified voters who are evangelical or pro-life and when we mail them and we phoned them and we knock on their doors and we email them and we push out digital ads and we send memes to their Facebook page and then after we do all that. We show up at their door and then after we do that. We call and we ask them if we need a ride. And then as soon as they vote early, we drop them out of our voter universe. And if they don't vote early, we call more. And if they haven't voted by 3 PM on election day, we call them again and we text them again.  </p><p>AUDIENCE: Woo-hoo. </p><p>REED: Do you think it doesn't make a difference? Do you think elections don't have consequences? Just look at what Josh Hawley just shared with you. It makes a big difference. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(OFF-MIC) Okay. </p><p>And boy am I--am I pleased to welcome back to Faith and Freedom's Road to Majority Policy Conference, a man who is not only a dear friend of mine, but a man who is a great friend of this organization and of our shared values. I truly believe that one of the most important things that has happened, in terms of our agenda of life, and liberty, and faith, and family. Was when this man made the decision in, I believe it was roughly February or March 2016. When we all received the shocking news of the death of one of our heroes, Justice Antonin Scalia. That the Senate was not going to vote on that vacancy, until after the American people had a chance to render their judgment in the presidential race.  </p><p>I think it not only gave us the opportunity to fill that vacancy. I candidly don't know if Donald Trump would've been elected president, had that vacancy not been there. I can tell you that our organization works with him and his office seamlessly, daily, collaboratively and he has been a total hero, on the executive calendar. Not only ensuring that Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh were confirmed and that second one was a tough one.  </p><p>They threw everything at him, including the kitchen sink, engaged in every smear, told every lie and I can tell you because I was there. Without this man's skillful leadership of the Republican Senate caucus, he would have never been confirmed and I am pleased to welcome back the majority leader of the United States Senate, Mitch McConnell. Please give him a warm welcome. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MCCONNELL: Hey.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>AUDIENCE: Woo-hoo. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MCCONNELL: Well, good afternoon everyone.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>How many of you have you watched the Democratic Presidential Debate last night?  </p><p>AUDIENCE: No.  </p><p>(BOOING) </p><p>MCCONNELL: A little quiz--a little quiz. Who won the Democratic Presidential Debate last night?  </p><p>AUDIENCE: You. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MCCONNELL: I did.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I dominated the debate last night. And here was their complaint. They settle he's doing is stopping everything. The House is sending over--  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And confirming conservative judges.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I plead guilty.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you, Ralph, for a great introduction and for your leadership in developing this outstanding organization that believes in the kind of America that we think we ought to have. The--it won't surprise you to know that I'm frequently asked, what being the Majority Leader of the Senate is like. I've thought about it for a while and come up with the perfect answer. It's a little bit like being the groundskeeper at a cemetery.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Everybody's under you, but no one is listening.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So, what is it, that I get to do, that the other 99 don't get to do? Ralph already said it. It's to decide what we're going to do and the single biggest decision I've made since I've been the Majority Leader of the Senate, was the decision not to do something. And it was not to fill the vacancy created by the Justice Scalia death in the middle of the presidential election. </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yeah. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MCCONNELL: And as Ralph pointed out, we're beginning to see the results. The president has made outstanding selections: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, but my friends you probably already know that most cases never make it to Supreme Court. The next step down as the circuit judges. The next step down is the district judges.  </p><p>Most complex ledge it--let it--litigation doesn't get past the circuit court level. They are extremely important. There were a lot of vacancies left when President Obama left office. I was the Majority Leader the last couple years. He was president. We didn't have a lot of time to fill all of those vacancies. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>This is a pretty alert crowd, Ralph.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>So, we had lots of opportunities and we didn't waste them. We did 30 circuit judges. The first two years. That's a record pace for any administration in the history of the country. We're now at 41, we'll soon be adding to additionally. So, let's put that figure in context. About one out of four of every circuit judge in the whole country has been appointed by this president and confirmed by this Senate in 2 1/2 years. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Let's look at a different way. Let's compare the age of the Trump nominees at the time of appointment to the age of the Obama nominees for the circuit court at the age of appointment. This presents of four-year younger at the start than President Obama. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>For example, one week recently reconfirmed a 37-year-old woman to the fourth circuit and a 39-year-old man to the sixth circuit in the same week. Let's look at a different way. Of the circuit judges in the country right now. The Trump appointees are 10 years younger than the Obama appointees. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So--so, you get the drift. What the president is looking for and sending up to us are highly qualified young men and women who believe in the quaint notion that the job of a judge is to follow the law. </p><p>AUDIENCE: Amen. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MCCONNELL: You wouldn't think that would be controversial, but it actually is. President Obama tipped his hand when he said he wanted to appoint judges who had empathy. Think about that for a minute. If you are the litigant for whom the judge has empathy, you are in pretty good shape. But what if you aren't, what if you are?  </p><p>Justice Scalia said, \"You are not a very good judge if you are not occasionally uncomfortable with the outcome you reach. Because your job is to try to follow the law. And he would also say, if you want to make policy, you ought to run for office.\" That's not what we do here.  </p><p>Justice Gorsuch said, \"We don't wear red robes or black--blue robes. We wear black robes.\" So, the kind of people the president is putting on the bench are young strict constructionist who believe that the job of the judge is to follow the law. I think that's the single most long-lasting contribution we can make to the country. I was obviously pretty excited election night when the president got elected. I don't know about you, but I didn't think he was going to win.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>But when it dawned on me at 1:30 in the morning we were going to have the House, the Senate, and the White House. I began to think about how unusual that is only 20 of the last hundred years. Just 20 years. One fifth of the time have Republicans had the Presidency, the House, and the Senate at the same time. I said to myself, this might not last very long and sure enough, two years later, we're back to divided government.  </p><p>But we tried to maximize in the last Congress in everywhere we could the things that we thought would get the country going and growing again and even though I'm not here today to talk about the economy. I think it's noteworthy. That as a result of tax reform and regulatory relief. We have a fifty-year low unemployment and 3% growth--GDP growth last year. Obama didn't have a single year at 3% GDP growth.  </p><p>So, we delivered a healthy economy. We're making long-term changes to the country through the court system and we're going to keep on doing it and my motto for the next year and a half is Leave No Vacancy Behind. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Let me talk a little bit about how challenging they've made it you arty know this because you follow this very closely, but the Senate on like the house is in the personnel business. We have an executive calendar and we have a legislative calendar and there are various devices I've engaged in some of them myself over the years, to make the wheels turn a little more slowly, but boy have the made the executive calendar challenging for us.  </p><p>Huh, just to give you an example. If you take--if you look back at the first two years of each of the last six presidents. The number of times the Majority Leader had to do what's called file closure to advance a nomination--any kind of nomination, only 24 times cumulatively over six presidents in the first two years. I had to do it. I hundred and 28 times, the last Congress. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, I want you to know they haven't made it easy and the reason they haven't made it is he is they're suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Whatever he's for they're against. </p><p>AUDIENCE: Exactly. </p><p>MCCONNELL: It doesn't make any difference what it is. We even had a challenge this week passing a bill to provide humanitarian assistance that is not in debate, definitely needed, for the crisis at the border. We managed to get it out of the Senate 84 to 8 and the speaker only in the last hour or so agreed to pass the House bill.  </p><p>Why? Because the President was willing to sign it. So, it must've been flawed. So that's been the work environment around here since divided government has been restored by the American people. Now I with a smile on my face declared myself recently. The Grim Reaper. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And I want you know why I embraced and apply that term to myself. As long as I'm Majority Leader of the Senate, we will not be taking up and we will not be passing things like the Green New Deal and Medicare for none. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Oh, and it gets worse.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>You may not have heard they have in mind statehood for the District of Columbia.  </p><p>AUDIENCE: Oh, no.  </p><p>MCCONNELL: Two Democratic Senators. Statehood for Puerto Rico, two Democratic Senators and you may or may not know that the number of Supreme Court Justices is actually set by statue.  </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yep. </p><p>MCCONNELL: Not to take the Constitutional Amendment or anything like that. It doesn't take a constitutional amendment to admit a state. It can all be done by a simple statue. So, then they're going to pack the Supreme Court that will increase the number to make our current 5-4 strict--construction as majority irrelevant so you but as long as I'm Majority Leader of the Senate, we're not doing stuff like that.  </p><p>AUDIENCE: Amen. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MCCONNELL: So, what we're confronting here, my friends, for the first time in my political rear and I--you know I have been here a while. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I'm now the longest-serving Republic Senate Leader in history. </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yeah. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MCCONNELL: I broke of Bob Dole's record about a year ago. I called him up. He took it well.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>As you know he has a wicked sense of humor.  </p><p>So, I've seen quite a lot but what I have not seen before is a real debate about something as fundamental to our country as whether we should have the free enterprise system or not. I mean they want to turn us into something we've never been and what I want you to fully understand is that a lot of socialist countries have voted it in. It didn't take a coo like in Venezuela or Cuba. They voted it in because they couldn't resist the temptation of what Margaret Thatcher once said about socialism. She said, \" The problem was socialism is pretty soon you run out of other people's money.\"  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>And so, this is a threat to America as it has always been at its core of free enterprise economy, not without compassion. We have plenty of compassionate programs. Medicare, Social Security, programs for disadvantaged people of one kind or another. We are not a capitalist country without compassion, but we are at our core an opportunity society. When the immigrants arrived here over the centuries, they came here not for a guarantee, but for the opportunity. For many of them, it was freedom of religion or flights from oppression of one kind or another. They came here not for a guarantee but for an opportunity to go as far as their talents would take them. And that's been the core of this country from the very, very beginning and it's all going to be debated next year. I never thought I would be in the middle of debate about socialism in this country.  </p><p>So, in addition to my excitement over being the biggest winner last night in the Presidential Debate.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>There is a sobering thought about what they're all talking about. They're all talking about turning us into a socialist country. All of them. So, don't think no matter who wins the nomination, even if he or she may ultimately say, \"Oh, I'm a moderate.\" Nuh-uh. Look at what they're saying, not what they're calling themselves and so we can allocate people get control of the government.  </p><p>AUDIENCE: We can't do it. </p><p>MCCONNELL: I don't know what's going to happen in the House of Representatives. There is no guarantee on the presidential election. There is no guarantee on the majority in the Senate, but I tell you this, if the U.S. Senate is the last place standing. None of this staff will pass while I'm the Majority Leader.  </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yeah. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MCCONNELL: One of the issues they backtracked on that you and I care a great deal about it . That is also alarming. We all know what the Hyde Amendment is. </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yes. </p><p>MCCONNELL: We all know that whether you are pro-choice or pro-life for over a quarter of a century we've accepted the Hyde amendment as a kind of basic standard that even if you might not have agreed with the pro-life crowd. Like all of us. At least to your degree that taxpayer funding ought to be provided for they're all backing away from that. Have you noticed that? They demanded to Joe Biden that he do a back flip on an issue that even he whose basically not in the same place we are on life issues agreed--agreed.  </p><p>So, this consensus reached during these continuous years--since 1973, on that issue. Is now up in the air. That basic notion. So, as the American public becomes more and more aware of when life begins because of the advances in technology that is producing more and more people sympathetic to the pro-life position.  </p><p>Our Democratic friends are going in the opposite direction. Head long in the opposite direction. So, I've had because I do have the ability to schedule several bills that we all care about up in the Senate. We've not been able to get 60 but I tell you, it's hard to get Democrats anymore on the pro-life side of any issue. So--excuse my cough.  </p><p>The things that we care about are all on the ballot next year in the Congress, at the White House, in the courts. It's a struggle to control as much of the government as possible but we're all in this together and I confess to have said this a couple of times in the past that I thought that particular year's election was the most important ever. I was wrong.  </p><p>I was wrong. We've never had a debate like this, at least in the last three decades. This is the big one. A really big one. And if we can hang on and beat back the socialist. We can save this country for your children and for your grandchildren. </p><p>AUDIENCE: Amen.  </p><p>MCCONNELL: With your hope, with your help, and your prayers, I want you to know I'll be standing there stopping this stuff for sure. Thank you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>UNKNOWN: You know what, I have heard all day about Virginia, South Carolina, Texas, but North Carolina has the biggest contingency here today, baby. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes. Yeah. </p><p>AUDIENCE: You know it. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Well, I think we have just scared the Majority Leader. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>I hope he's okay.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Well, I'm honored to introduce to you our Congressman from North Carolina on the agenda today. Mark Meadows is the Chairman of Freedom Caucus. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>AUDIENCE: Whoop. </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yeah.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>UNKNOWN: That's how many of you know him, we know him in North Carolina as a strong supporter and ally of President Donald Trump.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>As a matter of fact, when Donald Trump needed help in 2016, to secure North Carolina. He turned to Mark Meadows.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>UNKNOWN: In--in 2018. When President Donald Trump needed a leader in Congress to go fight for funding and securing the funding for building the border wall. He turned to Congressman Mark Meadows. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And now, when President Trump needs an ally to expose this phony Russian collusion scandal. He's turning to Congressman Mark Meadows. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yeah. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>UNKNOWN: And--and next year, when President Donald J. Trump, needs someone to help him campaign to Keep America Great. Rest assured, he will turn to Congressman Mark Meadows. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And as North Carolinians when we need someone to take a stand for conservative values, fiscal responsibility, defending the unborn, fighting for religious liberty, you better believe where we're turning. That's Congressman Mark Meadows. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to introduce to you our rock star Congressman from North Carolina, Mark Meadows.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MEADOWS: Thank you. Please keep your seed. I tell you it is--Wow. I do not get that kind of reception in Washington D.C.. God bless you. I tell you. Thank you. You know we--I just want to come--we have had an unbelievable day. I know your schedules you had leader McCarthy you had Whip Scalise you had all these different people that were supposed to come. We've been fighting just a few feet from here to make sure that we can secure our border and fight back against the Democrats from doing the wrong bill. I tell you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So--so, I have--I have just a--a couple of very quick remarks and I--Is it all right our is all right with you if I tell one story and some of you may have heard this story. Have you heard my red button story? Oh, okay. So, a few. So, I'm sorry that you are going to have to hear it again. All right? Is that all right?  </p><p>But I just wanted to you from the bottom of my heart. The reason I came over here and--and actually, I've got greetings from somebody else. The guy from Ohio that was trying to get here. Jim Jordan wants to say thank you for all that you're doing.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I couldn't get him off of the FOX set to come over here. No, no, I'm just kidding. Actually--actually, he's--he's working on--on some of this. So, I--I just--I just wanted to come and say thank you for being in the fight.  </p><p>AUDIENCE: Thanks.  </p><p>MEADOWS: Thank you for not growing--growing weary in well doing. God bless you. It is such an encouragement to me you know sometimes when you--you fight the fight, you--you don't always win. But what I keep hearing are two things when I go back home to North Carolina. And if you're not from North Carolina. God bless your heart. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>No. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>AUDIENCE: Georgia.  </p><p>MEADOWS: Okay, Georgia. My kids live in Georgia so that's okay and I've got--I've got friends in Virginia. So, don't give me all your states. All right.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>But as--as we look at this. I--one of the things that I hear when I go back is, they say, open Mac we just want somebody to fight for the forgotten man and woman. We want DC back to its rightful owner.\" Which is we the people and it's time that we give it back. Isn't it?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And so, whether it's on life, whether it is on religious liberty, which is under attack each and every day. Whether it is on the persecuted Christians, or whether it is standing with our ally and best friend Israel.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I can tell you. It is critical that you stay in the fight. It is critical. So, two real quick stories. One true story from the mountains of North Carolina things are not always as they seem. You've had some great speakers in here today and sometimes they will say things that never happen. I know that that comes as a shock to many of you. That you know every time a politician speaks. You know boom it happens. And actually, it doesn't, and I think that's what's discouraged so many of us. You know my wife many times you know she'll hit me when she sees something on TV and she'll nudge me and she goes, \"Honey, you've got to do something about that.\"  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I say, \"Well honey, I'm one of 535 members of Congress.\" She goes, \"Yeah, but you're the one I'm in the bed next to me.\" You know, so.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>And so, you know sometimes you just have to really work it but a true story from the mountains of North Carolina, I come from a place that there should never has been a member of Congress from where I live. We have 950 people that live there year-round. The light goes from red, yellow, and green in the wintertime to blinking you know and if you are really bored you can watch it blink the whole but--we're--they're--we're in the middle of nowhere. Well, to let you know how bad it is. We're in the middle of nowhere. We're 45 minutes from a Walmart. Does that put it into perspective?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>All right. So, we're really in the middle of nowhere.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And so, my--my--True story. The Episcopal Priests wife. He--She's going down--she's going to give a speech to a ladies group and as she's going down the mountain. She realizes that she's going down the mountain. She doesn't have any pantyhose on and so she wants to make good impression and so she goes down the mountain she pulls into the Walmart.  </p><p>She parks her car, jumps out of her car, runs into the Walmart, buys the pantyhose, comes running back out, jumps in the car, gets ready to take off, and realizes that there is not a place to put her pantyhose on between the Walmart parking lot where she's going. So, she decides to put them on in the front seat of her car. Now without getting too graphic. You can imagine the kind of gyrations that were going on in the front seat of the car, as she was trying to get the pantyhose on.  </p><p>And all of a sudden, she got this weird feeling that somebody was staring at her. Sure enough, she looks over her left-hand shoulder. She sees this guy staring in the window at her. She is incensed. She is outraged. She cannot believe it. Scary in the way that she is incensed she is outraged she cannot believe it. She opens the door, and she says, \"What do you want what? You pervert.\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>He says, \"I don't know ma'am, but you're sitting in my car.\"  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>True statement. I'm telling you, so things are not always as they seem. I just want to let you know, that things are not always as they appear and--and I say that to say that sometimes there are people that are fighting. Yeah, some of you can picture yourself doing that same thing. Right?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But as we look at that sometimes what happens is the fight is going on and you think that you know what the truth is, and actually it's not really the truth. It's a false narrative and I can tell you that there are a number of false narratives that are out there about this particular president and I tell you in knowing him personally--I talked to him earlier today from--from Tokyo. He was actually calling in on the citizenship question.  </p><p>You know we think that it is a prudent thing to ask a citizenship question. When you take a census--census. Don't you think that's prudent?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I mean, shouldn't we know.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>But--but you got to hear it from him direct and so I'm--I'm not going to give you a message from the President but what I do want to say is to tell you something about him that perhaps not many people know and it's another true story that happened very early on in the part of his Administration. I went in and I was advocating very passionately, that I felt like the president needed to do this and needed to go after it and then--and it was back during the days of Reince Priebus and he was there and--and as he was there. I--you know I kept saying that the president can't back up. He's got to do this and I'm just hitting it very hard and I--I get in the car we go.  </p><p>My wife had been waiting in the car and we go and we're starting to get back to our apartment, which is about 25 minutes away from the White House. And my phone rings and it's Reince Priebus and he says, \"Mark where are you mark where you?\" And I said, \"Well I'm--I'm actually almost back to the apartment.\" He says, \"Can you turn around and come tell the president what you touch told us?\"  </p><p>Now, my first thought is you work for the president. You tell him because I had been a little passionate and I said, \"Sure.\" So, I--I--I wasn't quite there yet. So, I stop the car and I asked my wife, my godly wife of almost 40 years if she would take a taxi to get back to the rest of the house.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>She did. Well, I won't go any further. She did, she took a taxi. I turned around and I came back as we--we go in--I come in and I go into the Oval Office and I know this may come as a surprise to many of you, it was the first time I had ever been invited to the Oval Office because I had only been in Congress six years that Obama didn't invite me a whole lot. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I know that is a shock to many of you, but I--I went in and actually the President wasn't there. He was actually in a little side office that was off of the Oval Office. Where he was doing some reading and--and he said, \"Mark my favorite Congressman. Come in.\" I was not his favorite congressman, but he was making me feel like I was his favorite Congressman. Come on in.  </p><p>I come in and I start advocating and I'm passionate and I'm talking to the President and saying you know you need to do this, and you need to do that. But he kept noticing I kept getting distracted. I kept looking down. There was about a 12-inch block of wood right in front of the president that had a red button in the middle of it. So, I would talk to him and I would look down at this red button.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I'd talked to him a little bit more and I looked down at the red button. Finally, he goes it makes you nervous doesn't it?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I said, \"Oh no, it doesn't make me nervous at all.\" And so, you know I'm passionate and I keep on and I'm going on a little bit. And so finally, he hits the red button. Well, my eyes get as big as silver dollars.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I'm looking from it--for incoming from anywhere you know and--and sure enough out of this door to my right, comes this Marine in full uniform and he sets a Diet Coke right there in front of the President of the United States. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>True story. He said--I said, \"Man, that's pretty neat.\" And he said, \"Do you want to see it again to Mark\" Swish. Boom. There was one for me.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So--so I'm there and--and I'm getting--and--and it dawns on me that here I am, this nobody from North Carolina, who never wanted to run for Congress, who felt the call from the Lord to run for the office, and who was obedient.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I hated speaking. I didn't want to speak. In fact, when I found that I was--I told my wife--I called my wife and I said I'm going to run for office. I feel like the Lord is telling me to do that. I got physically ill, had to pull over on the side of the road and throw up. That's how bad I didn't want it, and yet God will use each one of you if you'll just listen to that still small voice that is saying. \"Will you engage\"  </p><p>And for all of you, You've--you've decided to engage, and I just went to applaud you. Do not grow weary in well doing, as I said before, because you are making a difference. Not just here in your states, not in the--not in the nation's capital, not in the United States, but you're making a difference in the world. And I share the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey used to say, \"And the rest of the story.\" Now don't nod because if you nod, you're too old. Okay. You don't know what I'm talking about. You're going to go back in Google, right? You're going to Google it. All right.  </p><p>But the rest of the story is this. I was there that particular day advocating with the President of the United States that what he should do is keep his promise to the American people and move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and this president did exactly that.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>He exactly that.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>He is a promise keeping President. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And he deserves your applause and your prayers.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And your prayers.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So--so, I share that story to encourage you, just a little bit, because in the next room was a whiteboard with every single campaign promise he had made, when he had made it, and he was going down, checking off every one of those campaign promises. This President is a pro-life, promise keeping president and we need to be on our knees before our heavenly father praying for him each and every day. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Each and every day.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So, I will--I will close with this. Debbie and I need your prayers. I mean just bluntly that the battle is ongoing in each and every day. The enemy makes himself very know. You can maybe even feel it, sometimes in the city. The oppression that is really there. You can--you know you can cut it like a knife and yet we know--we know the Savior who has the power and the victory over death and the power and the victory over this city and I will tell you this, our God still reigns over the affairs of nations and we will never forget it.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>God bless you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you, so much. I love you guys.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you for loving me appreciate it.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>God bless you, appreciate it. Thank you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Up there in the cheap seats, thank you too, alright. God bless you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>HEAD: You can see why that energy translates to TV. Can't you?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>So--so, yeah. There--there you have it. Day two, in the--in the books. Except we--I--we're actually working on a little--in case you haven't heard there are debates that are happening. A little bit last night, a little bit tonight.  </p><p>And we're actually working on trying to finalize a room that anybody--everybody is more than--more than welcome to do your own thing, but--but later on in the night, tonight. We might actually have a little contingency unofficial things that if you want to watch you know a--a debates night with 1000 of your favorite friends--faith and--Faith and Freedom family friends, how are we going to--we'll--we'll send you an email.  </p><p>Hopefully in like the next hour or so. It'll be over at the Omni Shoreham and--and--and I think--I think it's going to be in a room called the Empire Room. The debate I think starts tonight at like nine. So--so, we'll--we'll probably have to wrap it up a little bit before they finish because we ourselves have our own work to be done tomorrow morning.  </p><p>But listen, thank you so much for being here this afternoon. Thank you for staying engaged. So, impressed. Had over 600 people, I think that came to this--this part of the program, after almost 1000 this morning. Over 1000 yesterday. Tomorrow-- </p><p>AUDIENCE: Repeat that.  </p><p>HEAD: Which part? For tonight? </p><p>AUDIENCE: Yes, repeat that. </p><p>HEAD: To--tonight if--if you're interested, we're going to try to get a--a--a little watch party for the debate at--at the Omni Shoreham probably in the Empire Room. The Empire Room. So, like maybe ask the concierge it's hard for me to describe without pointing to the map or whatever, but Empire Room is probably where we're going to be for--and we'll send an email sometime in the next you know probably hour and a half or so, at 9 PM.  </p><p>And speaking of nine, tomorrow morning is when we'll officially get--get ready--ramped--ramped up again and we're going to have another great--tomorrow morning we're actually going to have several Members of the Cabinet. Four different Cabinet Officials are going to come and visit with us and--and then a couple of other members of Congress.  </p><p>I would be remiss, our--one of our speaker's tomorrow morning is a--a Congressman by the name of Barry Loudermilk.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>In order to have this room. This physical room. A Congressman and--and their staff actually have to--to physically--to like to facilitate that, and Rob Atkinson, who is of the Chief of Staff for Congressman Barry Loudermilk. He drew the short straw so to speak. No, I'm kidding. He--he--they actually help in many, many ways legislatively, but--but Rob is just a great friend to Faith and Freedom Coalition and--and so is Congressman Loudermilk.  </p><p>And so, thank you, Rob Atkinson and thank you, Congressman Loudermilk's office, for helping to facilitate this great space. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And so, we--we have buses. The same five buses that--that will be going back to--to the--to the-- the hotels. So, if you can head back up where you came in. We have those five buses, otherwise you know if you can grab an Uber or we've got restaurants around here that you are welcome to help yourselves. Have a wonderful night, the rest of tonight and we'll look forward to either seeing you tonight unofficially or tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock at the Omni Shoreham. Thanks. Be blessed.  </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFJ-TBS1-F15W-H1RG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, on Wednesday and had three GOP cosponsors: Sens. Mike Braun of Indiana, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and Marco Rubio of Florida.</p><p> \"For too long, Big Tech companies like Twitter, Google, and Facebook have used their power to silence political speech from conservatives without any recourse for users,\" Mr. Hawley said in a statement. \"Section 230 has been stretched and rewritten by courts to give these companies outlandish power over speech without accountability. Congress should act to ensure bad actors are not given a free pass to censor and silence their opponents.\"</p><p> The proposal does not eliminate Section 230 protections completely, which some Big Tech allies have feared may still happen. Mr. Rubio said in a statement that he thinks Section 230 still serves an important purpose, but it should not be weaponized as a tool of political censorship and activism.</p><p> The Justice Department is also preparing to release a proposal of how it wants to limit Section 230.

Ted Cruz on Wednesday pilloried Facebook, Google and Twitter over allegations they censor conservative users and content online, threatening federal regulation in response to claims that Democrats long have described as a hoax and a distraction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tensions played out over more than three hours at a Senate hearing where Cruz, the leader of the Judiciary Committee's constitution-focused panel, pointed to reports that he said showed a \"consistent pattern of political bias and censorship on the part of big tech.\"</p><p>\"Not only does big tech have the power to silence voices with which they disagree, but big tech likewise has the power to collate a person's feed so they only receive the news that comports with their own political agenda,\" Cruz said.</p><p>But Democrats sharply rebuked Cruz and his GOP allies for convening the hearing in the first place. \"For decades, Republicans have bashed the supposedly liberal mainstream media in an effort to work the refs,\" said Sen. Mazie Hirono (Hawaii). \"Now that two-thirds of Americans get their news from social media, Republicans have a new boogeyman to target - big tech.\"</p><p>Hirono and her Democratic peers chided Republicans for ignoring the real ills of social media - including the rise of hate speech and disinformation online. And one of the witnesses Wednesday raised concerns that Facebook and Google hadn't been aggressive enough in the ways they police their platforms. Robbie Parker, a parent of a child killed during the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, said Facebook and Google-owned YouTube long had failed to stop conspiracy theorists and others from attacking him and his family.</p><p>\"They systematically failed to protect us from harassment and threats,\" Parker told lawmakers, later adding: \"Only when they realized it would tarnish their brand and affect them financially did they finally respond appropriately.\"</p><p>Conservatives long have claimed that major social-media sites exhibit political bias, pointing to Silicon Valley's liberal leanings and regular contributions to Democrats. Beyond that, however, experts have said there is no evidence that Facebook, Google and Twitter have deliberately sought to limit the reach of Republicans, a message that tech giants in attendance on Wednesday emphasized.</p><p>\"The notion that we would silence any political perspective is antithetical to our commitment to free expression,\" said Carlos Monje, Jr., the director of Public Policy and Philanthropy for the U.S. and Canada at Twitter.</p><p>But tech executives' continued pledges to treat all political content equally have failed to sway the country's most prominent Republicans, including President Trump, who repeatedly has claimed that Facebook, Google and Twitter are biased against the party. In March, Trump accused the industry of harboring \"hatred\" for a \"certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\"</p><p>As an example, Trump has pointed to his follower count on Twitter, which he said tends to fluctuate - a fact Twitter long has attributed to its efforts to shut down spam accounts on the platform. Still, Trump last month reiterated his threat for further scrutiny, telling reporters the government has to \"do something about it.\"</p><p>Opening the Wednesday hearing, Cruz on detailed a series of potential regulatory steps Congress could consider, including rethinking a longstanding federal law that spares companies from being held liable for content posted by their users. Cruz said lawmakers didn't seek to serve as \"government speech police,\" but he raised the potential for further antitrust scrutiny of the tech industry.</p><p>\"By almost any measure the giant tech companies today are larger, and more powerful, than Standard Oil was when it was broken up,\" Cruz said. \"And if we have tech companies using the powers of monopoly to censor political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues.\"</p><p>Cruz and his peers pointed to instances in which Facebook and Twitter erroneously applied its policies to conservative content, resulting in pro-life ads or tweets being removed from those social-media sites. One of the tweets Cruz displayed and claimed had been \"blocked\" - from the president of Susan B. Anthony List - claimed that abortion is \"profoundly anti-women,\" accompanied by a quotation from Mother Theresa. But a tweet from 2017 containing the same text and image still appeared on Twitter after a search Wednesday. A spokesman for Cruz did not immediately respond to request for comment about the tweet.</p><p>In another example, GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.) highlighted a 2017 controversy in which one of her campaign ads had been briefly barred by Twitter. The company later said it had been a mistake - and repeated its apology Wednesday.</p><p>In doing so, Facebook and Twitter emphasized they had taken action in response to controversial content posted by Democrats and Republicans alike. \"I can tell you we have actioned accounts on both sides of this debate,\" Monje said.</p><p>Absent from the Wednesday hearing was Google. The search giant, which owns YouTube, had been invited to testify, but Cruz rejected the company's witness. The GOP senator said he plans to hold a hearing, specifically focused on Google, in the coming weeks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-857cdfd824414a01b03ada266e65de7e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVM-85Y1-JB4M-V29B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><timeReceived>7:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The hearing examined a range of topics within the purview of the FTC, but of particular importance to privacy professionals was the discussion of whether the FTC should have expanded authority over privacy and data security. </p><p>The hearing followed two Subcommittee hearings on the creation of a federal privacy law, which Senator Moran (R-KS) noted was necessary in the wake of several large-scale data incidents and in light of the 'implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') in Europe, and the recent passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act [('CCPA')].' Senator Blumenthal (D-CT), echoing the need for a federal privacy law, stated that '[the U.S.] need[s] to do it not only because Europe has done it, not only because California has done it, but [because] these rules are long overdue' and that congress must '[p]rovide the FTC with the resources[,] expertise and structure to enforce the rules [and] establish meaningful penalties on first offenses to pose a credible deterrent . . . .' In working toward a bipartisan federal privacy law, the Subcommittee was specifically interested in input from the Commissioners on what should be included in the law as well as any additional tools the FTC would need to enforce it. Although little testimony was given on specific aspects of what should be included in the law, there appeared to be a consensus among the Commissioners that the FTC needs (1) direct authority to asses civil penalties, (2) authority over non-profits and common carriers for which there is currently an exemption, and (3) rulemaking authority under the Administrative Procedure Act. In predicting what may be to come from the FTC in light of growing privacy concerns, Chairman Simons indicated that the FTC may use its Section 6(b) power under the FTC Act\u2014which empowers the FTC to require an entity to file 'annual or special . . . reports or answers in writing to specific questions'\u2014to investigate big tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google regarding what consumer information is being collected and how that information used, shared, and sold. Privacy professionals should continue to monitor the development of a federal U.S. privacy law and should keep an eye on potential FTC investigation efforts into big tech as the discussion develops and continues. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111543583747991251762100235</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVP-8M01-JCMN-Y1JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"455\"/><timeReceived>1:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 30, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good morning, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Wednesday. It is Wednesday, March 27th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast. Safety in the sky, this morning, the Senate is holding a hearing today following the two deadly Boeing crashes, what to expect from that transportation hearing, as the 737 Max makes an emergency landing in Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Racing toward an IPO, Lyft reportedly seeing strong demand this morning as well. The price shares above the range last night, the details ahead of Friday's opening trade. And Green No Deal, the controversy plan -- controversial plan from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez failed in the Senate yesterday. One Senator going viral for the posters that he used to slam that deal. Plus, $750 million up for grabs tonight, that's the big Powerful drawing. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Futures are searching for direction this morning, we are looking at a lower opening for the broader averages, but fractionally. Dow Industrials down about 45 points right now, S&amp;P 500 down two, and the NASDAQ down one.</p><p>Our top story this morning, lawmakers are focusing on aircraft safety this afternoon with a Senate Commerce subcommittee on aviation and space. That hearing is following the deadly crashes of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet. This, as the same model aircraft made an emergency landing in Florida yesterday after a reported engine problem. Joining me right now is former FAA safety team representative and pilot, Kyle Bailey, is here. Kyle, great to have you on the program.</p><p>KYLE BAILEY, SAFETY TEAM REPRESENTATIVE, FAA: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Tell us what you think is most important in the hearing today in terms of looking at this 737 jet?</p><p>BAILEY: You know, I think as far as the FAA goes and with Boeing with the certification process, it really should be scrutinizing relationship they have, the two of them, if they're a little bit complacent, because Boeing really does a good job at the certification process. And it will be interesting to see when they investigate, you know, how the two are working together, and are they a little bit too complacent?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see. Because Boeing unveiled a software update today to fix this problem, and I guess it's the automated system, it was thought to have caused the 737's nose to tilt down in last October's Lion Air crash. Can you explain a little about that and what the issue is?</p><p>BAILEY: So, the system -- the software update, what that -- what that will do is there's an angle of attack indicator on the airplane. One sensor was feeding into that, or one, you know, of the actual -- on the exterior of the airplane. Now, two of those are going to feed into that sensor. So, if one malfunctions, there will still be another one that is giving input. So, there will be two in place of one. Also, as far as that nose, the system pushing the nose down to make the airplane descend in a potential stall situation, the system will only do that a couple of times. So, it will not be like the pilot will be struggling over and over and over again like, you know, what might have been the case previously.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How significant is this for Boeing? I mean, obviously, you're going to talk about major lawsuits coming at the company. But do you think that this is a major problem for the business and for how it may have to redirect itself?</p><p>BAILEY: Well, you know, keep in mind, Boeing isn't just in airplanes, they're also in the defense business, but as far as the airplane business goes, I mean, I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's an important product.</p><p>BAILEY: Yes. And the passengers, in general, are you know, typically fearful of flying for the most part. You know, they really have to build, you know, passenger confidence. And it'll be very interesting to see how they do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How can they do it?</p><p>BAILEY: You know, it's hard. I mean, they really just have to tell everybody what they're doing and prove everything. And, you know, test this airplane, test the new software to make sure everything is doing what it should be doing. So, now, you know, we've had two crashes already. I mean -- so, they're going to do the software fix. I mean, they really have to, you know, go out of their way to prove this to the general flying public that this stuff really does work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: To really communicate that they are on the -- on the issue. I'm worried about the FAA. I mean, does it surprise you that the U.S. was really the last of -- you know, in the globe in terms of grounding this jet?</p><p>BAILEY: Well, the FAA is very bureaucratic, but I have to say they do a fine job at what they do. And they typically work on the facts and statistics, so they really don't care about media pressure, they don't care about pressure from the public. I think this -- you know, incident might have changed things, but in general, they're pretty much facts and data- driven when they make decisions. So -- but this would be the exception, though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Kyle, it's great to have you, thanks so much.</p><p>BAILEY: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks for your insights on that. Kyle Bailey there. Meanwhile, IPOs are in focus, big year, Lyft reportedly will price its stock above the range, ahead of its IPO. Dagen McDowell with more on that. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Lyft- off, let's call it. So, Lyft is on its IPO road show at the moment, marketing the shares to potential investors, and it's been standing-room- only crowds, according to The Wall Street Journal. The targeted range previously talked about was between $62.00 and $68.00 a share, and now it is expected to price above that level. The Wall Street Journal says it's unlikely to be as high as $80, more likely to be in the low 70s. Nevertheless, Lyft will be valued at more than $23 billion on a fully- diluted basis when it goes public.</p><p>Here's one of the interesting things, so most of the big private companies have large shareholders, mutual fund companies that already owned shares privately. Lyft, not so much, with the exception of Fidelity Investments. So, there's a lot of demand there from mutual fund companies, potentially for this IPO because they don't have a stake in the company before it goes public. One concern is its profitability. You're looking at some of the major IPOs to watch.</p><p>This is a good sign for, say, Pinterest, Uber that will follow Lyft. And investors have told The Wall Street Journal, their concern is profitability, the path to profitability. Lyft last year lost $911 million. That was one of -- it was the biggest of any U.S. start-up in the 12 months preceding its IPO, the biggest lost there. But nevertheless, people are interested in this company, Maria.</p><p>And by the way, we talked about LEVI, LEVI is still trading. It went public, it was priced at $17.00 a share, it's trading at 22 bucks, that's a gain of 29 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, just in a couple of days, that was real successful. And how about Uber, what is its valuation? $120 billion or something on Uber.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A lot of upside here because Lyft is going to -- is promising that it's going to reduce its costs dramatically, reducing its insurance costs as it builds scale, so that's what they're telling investors about the path to profitability.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll keep talking about that. See you in a bit, Dagen, thank you. Meanwhile, prosecutors are facing backlash this morning after dropping all charges against actor Jussie Smollett. Lauren Simonetti with those details now and headlines. Lauren, what a story.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, wow! Chicago's mayor and police chief both raising questions about why Smollett was not held accountable for allegedly faking a racist, anti-gay attack on himself to gain attention for his acting career. Prosecutors say they dropped the charges after Smollett agreed to let the city keep its $10,000 in bail and to perform community service. But Smollett may not be out of the woods just yet. An investigation into a death threat letter the actor supposedly received prior to the alleged attack has been handed over to the FBI.</p><p>Take a look at this, shares of FiatChrysler trading sharply higher, up 3- 1/2 percent in the premarket. London's Financial Times is reporting that the company could be a takeover target once Renault restarts merger talks with Nissan, that in the coming months. The newspaper says the move is a new strategy following the arrest of former Renault CEO and former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn on financial misconduct charges. Ghosn, of course, has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>And it might be your lucky day, your chance to turn two bucks into 750 million. Tonight's Powerball jackpot, the fourth largest in history if someone picks the lucky numbers. They'll get a lump sum of $466 million before taxes. We always like to let you know your odds, your odds of winning, 1 in 292 million. There is a chance, Maria.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Lauren. All right, quick break. And then, coming up, Green No Deal, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's controversial Green New Deal fails test vote in the Senate yesterday as one Senator's poster against it goes viral. We'll tell you about that one. And then, battle of the drones, UPS is rolling out the first revenue-generating drone deliveries, beating out competition from Amazon and FedEx, much more on that when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big program this morning, coming up. Georgia Senator, member of the Senate Budget Banking, and Armed Services, and Agricultural Committees, David Perdue is with us this morning. Tennessee Senator and a member of the subcommittee on Aviation and Space, Marsha Blackburn is here, she's going to be at that transportation hearing today. Former adviser to President George W. Bush, Fox News Contributor Karl Rove joining us. Along with the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" author Gordon Chang is with us, as U.S. officials head to Beijing -- oh, they are in Beijing already for another round of trade talks. And Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Family Medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, \"Dr. Mike\" is here. Breakout of measles to talk about with Mike. You don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Green New Deal was denied yesterday. The Senate voted 57-0 against a procedural motion to take up the resolution. Most Democrats voted present to protest the GOP's action. A fiery response by freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to push back from Congressman Sean Duffy. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN: The Green New Deal is one that if you're a rich liberal from maybe New York or California, it sounds great because you can afford to retrofit your home or build a new home that has zero emissions, that's energy efficient, affordable and safe.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK: You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitists? Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning, the founder and CEO of Cheddar, Jon Steinberg is here, along with New Leaders Senior Fellow, Fox News Contributor, Richard Fowler. Dagen McDowell, that was some hearing yesterday on the Green New Deal, it looked like theatrics more than anything else. How did you see them?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I will not throw shade at a lady who can rock a red lip and uses her hands like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I kid. This is interesting. And my takeaway from just that comment from Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez when she was talking about -- she was talking about the dirty -- the water problems in Flint, Michigan and the South Bronx. She is not pointing to something that the Green New Deal would necessarily fix. She's pointing to problems that occur, say, in the South Bronx, this is one of the most socialist cities in the nation, where you have great government control and extremely high taxes, and you still have appalling conditions that people are living in. With the Flint water crisis, again, this is something that the government did not prevent and did not stop. So if she thinks that government is the solution, she just gave two examples of the government being the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. What do you think, Richard?</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Listen, I think the Green New Deal was a -- is a framework, right? Like I said, I don't think it's the perfect solution but here lies the problem. So we saw -- and I'm pretty sure we'll show the clip later of Utah Senator Mike Lee showing all these pictures of -- I think Ronald Reagan sitting on top of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's take a look at this because that was Senator Mike Lee yesterday and it went viral. His posters which slammed the Green New Deal. Here is one example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH: I rise today to consider the Green New Deal with the seriousness it deserves. This is a picture of Aquaman, a superhero from the undersea kingdom of Atlantis. I draw your attention, Mr. President, to the 20-foot impressive seahorse he's riding. Under the Green New Deal, this is probably Hawaii's best bet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is pretty funny.</p><p>FOWLER: It is funny and I'm pretty sure the Kinkos stocks should be going through the roof right now because he made a lot of -- he spent a lot in printing. But here is the truth is that both the United Nations, the Congressional report, the fact is that climate change is a real thing, right? And I think what we have on one side is the Green New Deal, I'm not saying it's the best solution but on the other side you have folks likes Senator Mike Lee saying that climate change, nothing to see here, nothing is happening and I think that is part of the problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch McConnell didn't know. Mitch McConnell actually is now on the record as saying I'm talking about climate change.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER: They haven't given any solutions and I think the solution exist sometimes in the middle when Democrats, Republican, businesses come together and say, OK, we have a problem here and that's actually trying to figure out some real solutions because the real problems like Super Storm Sandy flooding.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a nice thing to say that this is just a framework but it actually -- it is legislation that she would like to bring to the -- that she would like to see materialize, so it's not just a framework.</p><p>JON STEINBERG, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, CHEDDAR: But to your point, Maria, it's basically nonexistent on facts right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>STEINBERG: No one actually knows what's in the Green New Deal, the world is ending in 10 years, apparently it's causing asthma in New York City. But what we've seen here is the politicians level of marketing skill has completely evolve. I think largely as a result of President Trump, we have people now that know how to message, know how to use gimmicks, you've got presentations skills from somebody like AOC that are spectacular.</p><p>The way she presents, the way she speaks and we're entering sort of an area where this is what's going to define, you know, the movements that happened in this country. This socialism thing is unbelievably dangerous whether it's the Green New Deal or the pied-a-terre tax or the -- under the real estate kill tax basically in New York City. This kind of stuff is going to make things happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Green New Deal proposes explicitly retrofitting every house in America. This is the Wall Street Journal's editorial today. And eliminating fossil fuels within a decade. That is higher energy cost, it will hurt lower-income Americans more than anyone else and our standard of living as a nation will suffer and they have to answer to that. Instead all of these yesterday, Democratic presidential candidates voted present. The Journal is calling it profiles and present which is hilarious.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, it's -- that's the thing, I mean, you could say, yes, climate change is an issue, she could have just said that but to come up with this whole plan that is specific in terms of getting rid of fossil fuels in the next 10 years doesn't make any sense and that's why they're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER: Yes. I mean, I think the -- but the truth of the matter here is that her plan sits on one side and on the opposite side of the aisle there is nothing, there is no plan, there is zero, there is an empty box, right? And I think if you look at -- if you look at recent polls you will see millennials in the Republican side are saying climate change is real and their party doesn't have an answer to that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, the answer will be is that a carbon-free future is one -- is it creates a nation that you don't want to live in.</p><p>FOWLER: But that's not coming from the President or the party.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you -- and also well, they -- we talk about it endlessly on this program and it is private industry that has not only lowered our emissions --</p><p>STEINBERG: Absolutely, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- with the use of natural gas, it is private industry and getting out of the way of using and developing and discovering in a new way those very fossil fuels that are plentiful in this country that keep people's energy costs down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So there is a plan and Corporate America has been executing that plant --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG: Look at the electric car move, you know, we can -- you know, we all, you know, punch at Elon Musk for his craziness all day long. He's done more to affect, you know, hybrid and electric vehicles in this country than any amount of legislation, any amount of tax credits. He just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I forgot throw punches at Elon Musk although I think he's been a jerk in the past, I think that this is -- he ultimately by creating a cool car, he will get more people behind the wheel of the electric vehicle without AOC and her cronies telling us what kind of car to buy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG: I tried to do solar, you can't get it done on your house.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you can't get it done on your car because the sun is now always shining. We'll take a quick break. When we come back. The Federal Reserve is in focus. President Trump's expected nominee Stephen Moore reportedly in favor of the Central Bank cutting rates at this point. We're going to get into that. And then time for a change. Colorado's governor unveiling a new state logo. But it's his look that's gone viral. We'll be right back with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The Las Vegas review Journal says that giving Nevada a raise, minimum wage of $12 is possible by 2024. Proposed legislation raising minimum that wage to $12 an hour for workers not offered health insurance, $11 for those who are. The increase would be gradual, 75 cents a year beginning in 2020. Did you know Empire reporting an Alaska moose hunter can rev up his hovercraft according to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>Justices reeling at the National Park Service was wrong to ban John Sturgeon from using his hovercraft on a river running through a national preserve. The panel decided the agency does not have the jurisdiction over that stretch of land. The Denver post this morning writing, Governor Jarid Polis unveils new Colorado logo with a tree and a sea from the state flag. He says the new look better reflects Colorado and will not cause taxpayers any more money.</p><p>The Governor wearing a winter hat featuring the colorful logo during his presentation and that hack up plenty of comments on social media. Colorado's new logo.</p><p>FOWLER: I like it.</p><p>STEINBERG: He was my classmate at Princeton. He was my classmate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that right?</p><p>STEINBERG: Yes. He was always doing like start-ups and all sort of stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's awesome.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think Colorado is the coolest -- one of the coolest states in the country. I lived there for a couple of years and it's -- I think it -- the people in Colorado are also the thinnest in the nation because they're so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG: I want to ask you about the moose thing, OK?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG: -- because you know -- because you've mentioned some of the outdoor stuff to me before in the green room. Like isn't hunting a moose in a hovercraft won't actually the moose off?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is he hunting it?</p><p>STEINBERG: He was hunting moose in the hovercraft, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know that he was hunting, no.</p><p>STEINBERG: Oh, he was just chasing those.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. I think it was stretch of water.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a stretch of water.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It went through -- I don't know, I have to go read the story but I don't -- yes. But it depends on how loud his hovercraft is. I like how you turn to me from moose.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The moose story.</p><p>STEINBERG: I will -- I will - you can keep both of those. I'll stay right here in New York.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's my line of the day, don't hunt these majestic animals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>STIREWALT: I'm -- I concur.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Actually, look, you know what I want to talk about with you later on in the show, this idea about socialism and you said it was dangerous some of these plans.</p><p>STEINBERG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do you think it's so dangerous because people don't understand these are Federal programs and socialist program.</p><p>STEINBERG: Because I think you have an entire generation of young people that don't know that socialism is breadlines basically that are having it sold by them and not another generation, not a counter kind of marketing message of how great capitalism. I mean, Ken Langone's book, you know, I love capitalism, it was great, we need an AOC version of capitalism basically in terms of pitch.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a short break. When we come back. The technology battle. Apple is facing iPhone sales bans in the United States after Qualcomm's patent ruling. And then a special delivery. UPS beats out Amazon and FedEx to roll out successful revenue generating drone deliveries. We'll show you more when we come back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, March 27th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures are indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning. Take a look, the Dow Industrials Futures down 50 points right now, a quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 down 3 points, and the NASDAQ lower by 1 and three quarters, stock finished positive yesterday.</p><p>The Dow added nearly 141 points on the session. It was one-half of a percent higher at the close. The S&amp;P was up 20 points, three quarters of a percent, as well as the NASDAQ, 53 points higher yesterday, at the close.</p><p>Global markets this morning, under some selling pressure, European Indices are down across the board, as you can see, FT-100 down 23, CAC Quarante down 20, and the DAX Index down 28.</p><p>Shares were mixed in Asia overnight, Japan was down two-tenths of a percent, as you see there, a quarter of a percent, but the biggest mover was China, Shanghai Composite up almost one percent.</p><p>In favor of cutting interest rates, Stephen Moore, President Trump's pick for the Federal Reserve board, reportedly says that rates should be cut immediately by half of a percentage point.</p><p>May's tough decision, meanwhile, British lawmakers are looking for a new strategy this morning, for the country to exit the E.U., with Prime Minister Theresa May facing pressure, now to step down.</p><p>Special delivery now, by drone, UPS beats out Amazon and FedEx with drone deliveries of medical supplies, we'll show you how it works.</p><p>And then, smart glasses, Huawei unveils glasses that are all about sound, yes, Huawei, coming out with those glasses.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, right now, Apple and Qualcomm's legal back and forth, a U.S. trade judge, ruling that the technology giant violated a Qualcomm patent in the manufacturing of certain older model iPhones and recommended an import ban on some iPhones.</p><p>At the same time, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor of Apple and invalidated a Qualcomm patent on battery-saving technology. The two companies have been in a two-year long legal battle. Qualcomm says that Apple owes billions of dollars in loyalties over technology used, in their iPhones.</p><p>Joining us now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director, Daniel Ives, Dan, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us. First, give us your reaction to this Qualcomm-Apple fight which keeps going on?</p><p>DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: Yes, it's just another round in this 12-round heavyweight battle, I mean, there's (INAUDIBLE) Qualcomm feels like they have Apple against the ropes, in terms of some of the rulings they've gotten especially overseas.</p><p>You know, I think this was a bit of a gut punch to Qualcomm in terms of -- on the ITC ruling. And I think, right now, this continues to be overhang on Apple because they continue to come out at the wrong time, given iPhone sales a phone off a cliff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We want to talk more about regulation and the potential of it. Europe is obviously ahead of the U.S. The E.U. continues to take on big tech, the European Union, backing copyright reforms targeting Facebook and Google. They would require the companies to pay licensing fee to publishers for content posted on their platforms.</p><p>These new reforms also targeted copyrighted material by installing filters on the platforms, but, Dan, this is all on top of what we know to be hefty fines against Google, against other tech companies in Europe, much more aggressive in Europe than the U.S., will the U.S. follow suit at some point, do you think, and get a bigger government hand on tech?</p><p>IVES: This is another anti-big tech measure. I could tell you I talked to executives last night, a bunch from the valley, and these are nightmare who are ruling because from a copyright perspective, it's more lawyer-driven right around Brussels, but really anti-big tech.</p><p>We continue to think from GDPR to moves like the copyright, Europe continues to be much further ahead, regulatory wise, from the U.S., but look, with Warren and some others talking about breaking up big U.S. tech, that's something that investors are getting a little more worried about especially since we go into next election cycle.</p><p>STEINBERG: Dan, let's go back to Apple for a second. Investors have been talking about it nonstop since the media announcements this past week. It seems to me that Qualcomm is not the overhang, is that ultimately, it was a whole home event, a lot of celebrities, very light on details.</p><p>And ultimately, if you look at five-day chart on the stock, the service's revenue is supposed to be to solve for the flattening of device sales, but people seem to think it's not going to happen now, agree or disagree on that?</p><p>IVES: Oh, definitely, the battleground areas and services, we continue to look, 400, 450 billion of the valuation of services. And when I look at the announcement this week, I viewed it as a step in the right direction, ultimately they are keeping the play book close to vest.</p><p>There's a lot of competition of Netflix and Disney, but otherwise, we continue to do see Apple does make a large content acquisition, that's going to be significant not just from a distribution platform but from original content. That's the key right now for Cook and Cupertino with their back against the wall.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dan, it's Dagen McDowell, and I put out this crock pot theory, I think it was yesterday, that if investors become concerned about the growing competition from Apple and other content providers, that drives down Netflix stock.</p><p>That makes Netflix attractive potentially to Apple, sweeping them and buying them. Do you think Apple ultimately tries to buy Netflix?</p><p>IVES: Look, we have said the biggest strategic mistake that Apple and Cook have ever made, was not acquiring Netflix. I think it's becoming clearer and clearer, it's around services and content. That's why we believe that's still potential on the table.</p><p>But we view as CBS, Viacom, and A24 Lionsgate, as more likely in terms of the content acquisitions for Apple, even though they've never done historic M&amp;A. Right now, we believe the clock struck 12:00.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, yes, I mean, you know, content is king right now. Look at the billions being paid for original content. What about the privacy issues around at Facebook? I mean, this morning, the company is announcing it is cracking down on fake news, announcing it has removed more than 2,600 pages that are linked to fake accounts, the majority were tied to Russia and Iran.</p><p>But look, when you talk about fixes for the company's privacy issues, what does that mean? I mean, this is their business model, right? I mean, they sell data to advertisers, so can you really get out of what the issues are, without completely changing the business model?</p><p>IVES: Well, look, and that's why Cox and the other executives have been revolving door and leaving, because as you play nice in the sand box to the bell weight in Brussels, you ruin your business model. And I think that's the worry right here, is that, as you get more to privacy, it comes down to that's the worry for investors, that's why there's been the overhang here.</p><p>And I think there -- it's a fork in the road situation, they're going to have to kind of balance this because ultimately, especially when you look at what happened in Instagram and the messaging platform, that's going to be the key for Facebook, that's why in fang names, right now, you know, some queer overhangs, especially on the social media names, with Facebook front and center and a target on its back.</p><p>FOWLER: So, Dan, I mean, I think -- to add on to Maria's questions, so, I mean, how does Facebook deal with that, right? The fact that they have to police the site, they have to get all these sort of fake accounts off the site.</p><p>They have to get these people buying fake sites off the site. And at the same time, they have to make money off of ads. I mean, how do they balance those two for the marketplace?</p><p>IVES: Yes. We believe it's content-driven and fundamentally, Facebook right now, they're going to have to draw more and more content on the platform, focus more and more on user engagement. They're going to have to do these privacy issues, but it gets back to that is their core business model from an advertising perspective, that's what investors care about.</p><p>And that's also why even internally, at Facebook, that's what they care about. And that's why Zuckerberg right now, there's a battle going on internally, where they have to continue to stick to their core knitting, otherwise, even there could be, you know, some nightmares days ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I was just going to say, oh, so they are media companies, but they can't be sued for defamation under federal law?</p><p>And again, I brought this up, Devin Nunes' lawsuit against Twitter, it's pushing the legal boundaries of what is going on, because mid-'90s law, you cannot sue internet service providers and other companies because they don't technically create the content and aren't media companies, but they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but they are.</p><p>STEINBERG: On Dan's last point, they don't want to stick to their knitting anymore. Zuckerberg has come out and said now it's all going to be about private messaging. This is his big of a shift, as post IPO, when they had to make the pivot to mobile. And now, you're going to have to bet on a whole new company. They're exiting this public arena.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not a whole new company, though, they are reckless with people's private information and I think that that's what investors know, and I think that's what the public knows, is you're saying it's private, but you can still see all of these messages and all of these communication.</p><p>And what are Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg going to actually do with that, do we trust them? Somebody told me, doing business with them, like you cannot trust what they tell you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you mentioned Dan -- and you mentioned Devin Nunes and his lawsuit against Twitter, more are coming, I understand (INAUDIBLE) as well as the Daily Beast, he's going to be suing others, and he'll be joining us this week, by the way, to talk about it. Dan Ives, it's good to see you this morning, thank you.</p><p>IVES: Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll keep watching. Meanwhile, a date has been set for Elon Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission to square off in court. Lauren Simonetti on that story in headlines this morning, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: We have the date, Maria, Elon Musk's contempt of court case, set for April 4th. A federal judge in New York, hearing arguments on the SEC's claim the tweet, Musk, posted in February, violated terms of his fraud settlement, because Musk didn't get approval from Tesla.</p><p>UPS is making history today. The company is testing drone deliveries of medical supplies to a hospital in North Carolina. The flight marks the first commercial drone deliveries approved by FAA. Drones will transport lab samples from hospitals to doctors' offices and so forth, getting them to their destinations much quicker than ground deliveries, essentially from 30 minutes to 3 minutes.</p><p>Huawei is teaming up with Gentle Monster, that's a Korean fashion brand. They are set to release their first smart glasses. You're looking at them. If you buy a pair, you'll be able to listen to music and take phone calls simply by tapping the temple of the glasses, so you won't have to wear ear buds.</p><p>The glasses can be charged wirelessly, they go on sale in July. We don't know how much they are going to cost. Glasses -- smart glasses have struggled from other companies, we'll see if this one will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it spying on all your data and what comes up there, I mean, Huawei has its own issues, we know that, and the U.S. government is trying to ban Huawei telecom and technology from the U.S.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And if you're wearing something, is it, you know, spying on all the people around you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: What is it doing with that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll have to look at that. Coming up, thank you, Lauren, eye on China trade, top U.S. officials back at the table this week, another round of talks with China, what can get done, we're going to get into it when we come back, and then tough decisions in the U.K. this morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May faces increasing pressure to step down, lawmakers there, looking for another strategy to exit the European Union, all ahead right here, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are watching negotiations between the U.S. and China. Big week. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing this morning ahead of high-level talks tomorrows. Joining us right now to talk about what it means for markets and investing Tiger 21 Chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt. It is good to see you this morning, Michael.</p><p>MICHAEL SONNENFELDT, CHAIRMAN, TIGER 21: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. What are your members doing in terms of allocating capital, how important is a China deal to them in terms of putting money to work in markets?</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Well, first of all, our members have been shying away from China for all of the problems, rule of law being one of them but as far as the negotiations when our members think about their businesses, they've been getting stolen intellectual property. It's hard to develop a product when fake product is in China within 24 hours. So, on the intellectual property, that's got to have some progress and then you have tariffs and quotas, and we want to tamp it down because we know bad things happen when that gets out of control. So, members who are running small businesses, they know that these are the two factors that they're looking at.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So, we want to talk China this morning, we also going to talk rates. Dagen, look at this 10-year yield which has happened in the last half an hour. The yield has dropped below 2.4 percent, this is a big move here, down four basis points, what do you make of it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I think some of this is a reaction to the comments of Steve Moore, who is the nominee to be on Federal Reserve Board by president. Yes, to President Trump. I almost said Obama. President Trump trading in fed fund futures indicates a 70 percent -- 75 percent probability for a rate cut by the end of the year based on Steve Moore is saying that the Fed should cut rates. So, this is very often when you see the yield curve invert where shorter term rates are higher. This is telling you that the Fed will be cutting rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, is this a positive or a negative? I mean, look, rates being lowered is a good thing usually but if it's indicating things are a lot slower than anybody thought, do investors react negatively to that story?</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Look, for my member's point of view, I was in a meeting yesterday where people are trying to make sense of this. Most recessions are indicated by an inverted yield curves, not all inverted yield curves mean we have recession. But it's a warning signal, it's one of those red flags. So, clearly people are concerned about the Fed, but generally, the Fed has been high marks when you think about the changes at the Fed over the last year. I think people are pleasantly surprised.</p><p>STEINBERG: Michael, that's my question to you, which is usually, the inverted yield curve means a recession but we've never seen this level of whipsawing in interest rates and kind of reversal that's being messaged now. Can we say the economy is fundamentally strong, that the removal of any chance of impeachment removes kind of the, the domestic overhang that could rattle the market and then ultimately, this is just a readjustment with the new Fed chairman?</p><p>SONNENFELDT: So, for business people, not economists trying to run small businesses, that is what our members are about. They balance what you just said with the trillion-dollar deficit. We've never had a trillion-dollar deficit. So, it's like when you're pulling a rope. Now, we have one in one direction and one in the other and nobody knows which part of that is going to win. You can have the kind of trillion-dollar deficit even though the signals are pretty good right now. The members in our group were saying it's kind of like being on thin ice: we're still skating, but it feels like the ice is getting thinner and thinner.</p><p>FOWLER: So, Michael, the question around this China trade thing that Maria brought up at the top of this segment, right, so I think the two issues you brought up both tariffs as well as intellectual property, seemed to be sticking point for China, right? Because what China wants is immediate relief of the tariffs, but they don't really want to give up intellectual property which is why this negotiation have sort of hung on for so long. So, how does the folks in your group see this, right, and what is the best outcome for them?</p><p>SONNENFELDT: I would say of all of the policy areas that are going on, the one where our members, which are businessmen, left, right, conservative, liberal, the ones that they concentrate on is the intellectual property. If we don't break the back of this kind of activity, every time you invest, I have a company in Germany that we create little computers in the solar business. Within 24 hours of a new product, a fake product is on the web in China. You can't afford to make investments if every time you make an investment, it's stolen. So, this is an absolute bedrock issue for any kind of basic business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I think the Trump administration knows that, but the question is: are they going to be able to put in some kind of an enforcement mechanism where they could just, you know, snap back tariffs or do something should China not follow through on its promises to stop stealing.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Well, certainly, our negotiator, Lighthizer, is one of the tough negotiators. You got to give the administration credit for putting somebody in who has a spine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, we'll leave it there. Michael, it's great to see you.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Michael Sonnenfeldt there. Coming up, the search for more options: British Prime Minister Theresa May told to set a date for her departure as lawmakers consider alternative plans to leave the E.U. That's next. Back in a minute right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. British lawmakers are voting on other option this is morning for the country's exit from the E.U. Prime Minister Theresa May is now facing pressure to step down. Ashley Webster with all the details right now. Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Hey, Maria, listen, she's been under pressure for a long time, Theresa May. She will step down. It's a matter of whether she can get her deal across the line, which she has not been able to do. In fact, humiliating defeats twice now. And if she can get it across the line, she will resign at that point too. So, her future, we know, is outside of number 10 Downing Street. The bigger issue, though, is how the heck they're going to break this deadlock in parliament. They're going to be voting on 16 different options being proposed today, house speaker -- House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, the guy that shouts order, order. He'll decide which ones will be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You sound like him.</p><p>WEBSTER: Thank you very much. He will decide which ones will be debated, he'll probably whittle it down to half a dozen. But let's point this out, none of what happens today, the debate and the votes mean anything. They are non-binding and Theresa May can completely ignore what they do today; it's just parliament saying, we've told you what we want to vote for but now, today, we're going to show you what we will vote for. If there's a massive majority in parliament for one particular option that will put a lot of political pressure on Theresa May and she may be impossible for her to ignore. But bottom line here is, you know, this is crunch time and she still doesn't have enough votes for her plans.</p><p>FOWLER: So, Ashley, will her deal get a third vote? So, I mean, the speaker has already ruled that her deal wouldn't get up their vote like a couple -- a week or two ago. Will her deal get a third vote now?</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, it will because the E.U. has now put stipulations on it. So, you could argue it's now in the different form. There are reports that maybe a third time will happen this Friday symbolically because it's March 29th, the day that the U.K. was supposed to leave the E.U. If not, sometime next week. But by the way, these votes taking place today, these indicative votes will get whittled down and we could see another round of this next Monday, April Fool's Day, make of that what you will. Bottom line is, this is going to be -- there's still a no-deal option on the table as far as Johnson said today.</p><p>STEINBERG: Ashley, that's my question to you. So, when I can't get over something, and I'm not doing something, my dad says: John, move on, move on, right?</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>STEINBERG: It's over. They're Brexiting, move on. Why can they not just get --</p><p>WEBSTER: Because Theresa May's greatest quality is her persistence. Her biggest problem is her persistence and her stubbornness. She's kind of said, it's my way, these are my red lines, nothing changes. Parliament has said, that's not good enough and that's where we're at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Wow, what a story. Ashley, thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. When we come back, coffee with the side of playtime. We'll take you to unique coffee where you can cuddle with corgi. Next hour right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, March 27th. Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.

Good morning, everyone.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Wednesday.  It is Wednesday, March 27th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.  Safety in the sky, this morning, the Senate is holding a hearing today following the two deadly Boeing crashes, what to expect from that transportation hearing, as the 737 Max makes an emergency landing in Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Racing toward an IPO, Lyft reportedly seeing strong demand this morning as well.  The price shares above the range last night, the details ahead of Friday's opening trade.  And Green No Deal, the controversy plan -- controversial plan from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez failed in the Senate yesterday.  One Senator going viral for the posters that he used to slam that deal.  Plus, $750 million up for grabs tonight, that's the big Powerful drawing.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Futures are searching for direction this morning, we are looking at a lower opening for the broader averages, but fractionally.  Dow Industrials down about 45 points right now, S&amp;P 500 down two, and the NASDAQ down one.</p><p>Our top story this morning, lawmakers are focusing on aircraft safety this afternoon with a Senate Commerce subcommittee on aviation and space.  That hearing is following the deadly crashes of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet.  This, as the same model aircraft made an emergency landing in Florida yesterday after a reported engine problem.  Joining me right now is former FAA safety team representative and pilot, Kyle Bailey, is here.  Kyle, great to have you on the program.</p><p>KYLE BAILEY, SAFETY TEAM REPRESENTATIVE, FAA:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Tell us what you think is most important in the hearing today in terms of looking at this 737 jet?</p><p>BAILEY:  You know, I think as far as the FAA goes and with Boeing with the certification process, it really should be scrutinizing relationship they have, the two of them, if they're a little bit complacent, because Boeing really does a good job at the certification process.  And it will be interesting to see when they investigate, you know, how the two are working together, and are they a little bit too complacent?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  Because Boeing unveiled a software update today to fix this problem, and I guess it's the automated system, it was thought to have caused the 737's nose to tilt down in last October's Lion Air crash.  Can you explain a little about that and what the issue is?</p><p>BAILEY:  So, the system -- the software update, what that -- what that will do is there's an angle of attack indicator on the airplane.  One sensor was feeding into that, or one, you know, of the actual -- on the exterior of the airplane.  Now, two of those are going to feed into that sensor.  So, if one malfunctions, there will still be another one that is giving input.  So, there will be two in place of one.  Also, as far as that nose, the system pushing the nose down to make the airplane descend in a potential stall situation, the system will only do that a couple of times.  So, it will not be like the pilot will be struggling over and over and over again like, you know, what might have been the case previously.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significant is this for Boeing?  I mean, obviously, you're going to talk about major lawsuits coming at the company.  But do you think that this is a major problem for the business and for how it may have to redirect itself?</p><p>BAILEY:  Well, you know, keep in mind, Boeing isn't just in airplanes, they're also in the defense business, but as far as the airplane business goes, I mean, I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an important product.</p><p>BAILEY:  Yes.  And the passengers, in general, are you know, typically fearful of flying for the most part.  You know, they really have to build, you know, passenger confidence.  And it'll be very interesting to see how they do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can they do it?</p><p>BAILEY:  You know, it's hard.  I mean, they really just have to tell everybody what they're doing and prove everything.  And, you know, test this airplane, test the new software to make sure everything is doing what it should be doing.  So, now, you know, we've had two crashes already.  I mean -- so, they're going to do the software fix.  I mean, they really have to, you know, go out of their way to prove this to the general flying public that this stuff really does work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To really communicate that they are on the -- on the issue.  I'm worried about the FAA.  I mean, does it surprise you that the U.S. was really the last of -- you know, in the globe in terms of grounding this jet?</p><p>BAILEY:  Well, the FAA is very bureaucratic, but I have to say they do a fine job at what they do.  And they typically work on the facts and statistics, so they really don't care about media pressure, they don't care about pressure from the public.  I think this -- you know, incident might have changed things, but in general, they're pretty much facts and data-driven when they make decisions.  So -- but this would be the exception, though.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Kyle, it's great to have you, thanks so much.</p><p>BAILEY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for your insights on that.  Kyle Bailey there.  Meanwhile, IPOs are in focus, big year, Lyft reportedly will price its stock above the range, ahead of its IPO.  Dagen McDowell with more on that.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Lyft-off, let's call it.  So, Lyft is on its IPO road show at the moment, marketing the shares to potential investors, and it's been standing-room-only crowds, according to The Wall Street Journal.  The targeted range previously talked about was between $62.00 and $68.00 a share, and now it is expected to price above that level.  The Wall Street Journal says it's unlikely to be as high as $80, more likely to be in the low 70s.  Nevertheless, Lyft will be valued at more than $23 billion on a fully-diluted basis when it goes public.</p><p>Here's one of the interesting things, so most of the big private companies have large shareholders, mutual fund companies that already owned shares privately.  Lyft, not so much, with the exception of Fidelity Investments.  So, there's a lot of demand there from mutual fund companies, potentially for this IPO because they don't have a stake in the company before it goes public.  One concern is its profitability.  You're looking at some of the major IPOs to watch.</p><p>This is a good sign for, say, Pinterest, Uber that will follow Lyft.  And investors have told The Wall Street Journal, their concern is profitability, the path to profitability.  Lyft last year lost $911 million.  That was one of -- it was the biggest of any U.S. start-up in the 12 months preceding its IPO, the biggest lost there.  But nevertheless, people are interested in this company, Maria.</p><p>And by the way, we talked about LEVI, LEVI is still trading.  It went public, it was priced at $17.00 a share, it's trading at 22 bucks, that's a gain of 29 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, just in a couple of days, that was real successful.  And how about Uber, what is its valuation?  $120 billion or something on Uber.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A lot of upside here because Lyft is going to -- is promising that it's going to reduce its costs dramatically, reducing its insurance costs as it builds scale, so that's what they're telling investors about the path to profitability.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep talking about that.  See you in a bit, Dagen, thank you.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are facing backlash this morning after dropping all charges against actor Jussie Smollett.  Lauren Simonetti with those details now and headlines.  Lauren, what a story.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, wow!  Chicago's mayor and police chief both raising questions about why Smollett was not held accountable for allegedly faking a racist, anti-gay attack on himself to gain attention for his acting career.  Prosecutors say they dropped the charges after Smollett agreed to let the city keep its $10,000 in bail and to perform community service.  But Smollett may not be out of the woods just yet.  An investigation into a death threat letter the actor supposedly received prior to the alleged attack has been handed over to the FBI.</p><p>Take a look at this, shares of FiatChrysler trading sharply higher, up 3-1/2 percent in the premarket.  London's Financial Times is reporting that the company could be a takeover target once Renault restarts merger talks with Nissan, that in the coming months.  The newspaper says the move is a new strategy following the arrest of former Renault CEO and former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn on financial misconduct charges.  Ghosn, of course, has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>And it might be your lucky day, your chance to turn two bucks into 750 million.  Tonight's Powerball jackpot, the fourth largest in history if someone picks the lucky numbers.  They'll get a lump sum of $466 million before taxes.  We always like to let you know your odds, your odds of winning, 1 in 292 million.  There is a chance, Maria.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Lauren.  All right, quick break.  And then, coming up, Green No Deal, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's controversial Green New Deal fails test vote in the Senate yesterday as one Senator's poster against it goes viral.  We'll tell you about that one.  And then, battle of the drones, UPS is rolling out the first revenue-generating drone deliveries, beating out competition from Amazon and FedEx, much more on that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big program this morning, coming up.  Georgia Senator, member of the Senate Budget Banking, and Armed Services, and Agricultural Committees, David Perdue is with us this morning.  Tennessee Senator and a member of the subcommittee on Aviation and Space, Marsha Blackburn is here, she's going to be at that transportation hearing today.  Former adviser to President George W. Bush, Fox News Contributor Karl Rove joining us.  Along with the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" author Gordon Chang is with us, as U.S. officials head to Beijing -- oh, they are in Beijing already for another round of trade talks.  And Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Family Medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, \"Dr. Mike\" is here.  Breakout of measles to talk about with Mike.  You don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Green New Deal was denied yesterday.  The Senate voted 57-0 against a procedural motion to take up the resolution.  Most Democrats voted present to protest the GOP's action.  A fiery response by freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to push back from Congressman Sean Duffy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  The Green New Deal is one that if you're a rich liberal from maybe New York or California, it sounds great because you can afford to retrofit your home or build a new home that has zero emissions, that's energy efficient, affordable and safe.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitists?  Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, the founder and CEO of Cheddar, Jon Steinberg is here, along with New Leaders Senior Fellow, Fox News Contributor, Richard Fowler.  Dagen McDowell, that was some hearing yesterday on the Green New Deal, it looked like theatrics more than anything else.  How did you see them?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will not throw shade at a lady who can rock a red lip and uses her hands like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I kid.  This is interesting.  And my takeaway from just that comment from Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez when she was talking about -- she was talking about the dirty -- the water problems in Flint, Michigan and the South Bronx.  She is not pointing to something that the Green New Deal would necessarily fix.  She's pointing to problems that occur, say, in the South Bronx, this is one of the most socialist cities in the nation, where you have great government control and extremely high taxes, and you still have appalling conditions that people are living in.  With the Flint water crisis, again, this is something that the government did not prevent and did not stop.  So if she thinks that government is the solution, she just gave two examples of the government being the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What do you think, Richard?</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Listen, I think the Green New Deal was a -- is a framework, right?  Like I said, I don't think it's the perfect solution but here lies the problem.  So we saw -- and I'm pretty sure we'll show the clip later of Utah Senator Mike Lee showing all these pictures of -- I think Ronald Reagan sitting on top of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's take a look at this because that was Senator Mike Lee yesterday and it went viral.  His posters which slammed the Green New Deal.  Here is one example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH:  I rise today to consider the Green New Deal with the seriousness it deserves.  This is a picture of Aquaman, a superhero from the undersea kingdom of Atlantis.  I draw your attention, Mr. President, to the 20-foot impressive seahorse he's riding.  Under the Green New Deal, this is probably Hawaii's best bet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is pretty funny.</p><p>FOWLER:  It is funny and I'm pretty sure the Kinkos stocks should be going through the roof right now because he made a lot of -- he spent a lot in printing.  But here is the truth is that both the United Nations, the Congressional report, the fact is that climate change is a real thing, right?  And I think what we have on one side is the Green New Deal, I'm not saying it's the best solution but on the other side you have folks likes Senator Mike Lee saying that climate change, nothing to see here, nothing is happening and I think that is part of the problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch McConnell didn't know.  Mitch McConnell actually is now on the record as saying I'm talking about climate change.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER:  They haven't given any solutions and I think the solution exist sometimes in the middle when Democrats, Republican, businesses come together and say, OK, we have a problem here and that's actually trying to figure out some real solutions because the real problems like Super Storm Sandy flooding.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a nice thing to say that this is just a framework but it actually -- it is legislation that she would like to bring to the -- that she would like to see materialize, so it's not just a framework.</p><p>JON STEINBERG, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, CHEDDAR:  But to your point, Maria, it's basically nonexistent on facts right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>STEINBERG:  No one actually knows what's in the Green New Deal, the world is ending in 10 years, apparently it's causing asthma in New York City.  But what we've seen here is the politicians level of marketing skill has completely evolve.  I think largely as a result of President Trump, we have people now that know how to message, know how to use gimmicks, you've got presentations skills from somebody like AOC that are spectacular.</p><p>The way she presents, the way she speaks and we're entering sort of an area where this is what's going to define, you know, the movements that happened in this country.  This socialism thing is unbelievably dangerous whether it's the Green New Deal or the pied-a-terre tax or the -- under the real estate kill tax basically in New York City.  This kind of stuff is going to make things happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Green New Deal proposes explicitly retrofitting every house in America.  This is the Wall Street Journal's editorial today.  And eliminating fossil fuels within a decade.  That is higher energy cost, it will hurt lower-income Americans more than anyone else and our standard of living as a nation will suffer and they have to answer to that.  Instead all of these yesterday, Democratic presidential candidates voted present.  The Journal is calling it profiles and present which is hilarious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's -- that's the thing, I mean, you could say, yes, climate change is an issue, she could have just said that but to come up with this whole plan that is specific in terms of getting rid of fossil fuels in the next 10 years doesn't make any sense and that's why they're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER:  Yes.  I mean, I think the -- but the truth of the matter here is that her plan sits on one side and on the opposite side of the aisle there is nothing, there is no plan, there is zero, there is an empty box, right?  And I think if you look at -- if you look at recent polls you will see millennials in the Republican side are saying climate change is real and their party doesn't have an answer to that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the answer will be is that a carbon-free future is one -- is it creates a nation that you don't want to live in.</p><p>FOWLER:  But that's not coming from the President or the party.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you -- and also well, they -- we talk about it endlessly on this program and it is private industry that has not only lowered our emissions --</p><p>STEINBERG:  Absolutely, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- with the use of natural gas, it is private industry and getting out of the way of using and developing and discovering in a new way those very fossil fuels that are plentiful in this country that keep people's energy costs down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there is a plan and Corporate America has been executing that plant --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  Look at the electric car move, you know, we can -- you know, we all, you know, punch at Elon Musk for his craziness all day long.  He's done more to affect, you know, hybrid and electric vehicles in this country than any amount of legislation, any amount of tax credits.  He just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I forgot throw punches at Elon Musk although I think he's been a jerk in the past, I think that this is -- he ultimately by creating a cool car, he will get more people behind the wheel of the electric vehicle without AOC and her cronies telling us what kind of car to buy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  I tried to do solar, you can't get it done on your house.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you can't get it done on your car because the sun is now always shining.  We'll take a quick break.  When we come back.  The Federal Reserve is in focus.  President Trump's expected nominee Stephen Moore reportedly in favor of the Central Bank cutting rates at this point.  We're going to get into that.  And then time for a change.  Colorado's governor unveiling a new state logo.  But it's his look that's gone viral.  We'll be right back with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning.  The Las Vegas review Journal says that giving Nevada a raise, minimum wage of $12 is possible by 2024.  Proposed legislation raising minimum that wage to $12 an hour for workers not offered health insurance, $11 for those who are.  The increase would be gradual, 75 cents a year beginning in 2020.  Did you know Empire reporting an Alaska moose hunter can rev up his hovercraft according to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>Justices reeling at the National Park Service was wrong to ban John Sturgeon from using his hovercraft on a river running through a national preserve.  The panel decided the agency does not have the jurisdiction over that stretch of land.  The Denver post this morning writing, Governor Jarid Polis unveils new Colorado logo with a tree and a sea from the state flag.  He says the new look better reflects Colorado and will not cause taxpayers any more money.</p><p>The Governor wearing a winter hat featuring the colorful logo during his presentation and that hack up plenty of comments on social media.  Colorado's new logo.</p><p>FOWLER:  I like it.</p><p>STEINBERG:  He was my classmate at Princeton.  He was my classmate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that right?</p><p>STEINBERG:  Yes.  He was always doing like start-ups and all sort of stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's awesome.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Colorado is the coolest -- one of the coolest states in the country.  I lived there for a couple of years and it's -- I think it -- the people in Colorado are also the thinnest in the nation because they're so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  I want to ask you about the moose thing, OK?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  -- because you know -- because you've mentioned some of the outdoor stuff to me before in the green room.  Like isn't hunting a moose in a hovercraft won't actually the moose off?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is he hunting it?</p><p>STEINBERG:  He was hunting moose in the hovercraft, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that he was hunting, no.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Oh, he was just chasing those.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No. I think it was stretch of water.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a stretch of water.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It went through -- I don't know, I have to go read the story but I don't -- yes.  But it depends on how loud his hovercraft is.  I like how you turn to me from moose.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The moose story.</p><p>STEINBERG:  I will -- I will - you can keep both of those.  I'll stay right here in New York.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's my line of the day, don't hunt these majestic animals.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>STIREWALT:  I'm -- I concur.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, look, you know what I want to talk about with you later on in the show, this idea about socialism and you said it was dangerous some of these plans.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think it's so dangerous because people don't understand these are Federal programs and socialist program.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Because I think you have an entire generation of young people that don't know that socialism is breadlines basically that are having it sold by them and not another generation, not a counter kind of marketing message of how great capitalism.  I mean, Ken Langone's book, you know, I love capitalism, it was great, we need an AOC version of capitalism basically in terms of pitch.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back.  The technology battle.  Apple is facing iPhone sales bans in the United States after Qualcomm's patent ruling.  And then a special delivery.  UPS beats out Amazon and FedEx to roll out successful revenue generating drone deliveries.  We'll show you more when we come back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, March 27th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures are indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning.  Take a look, the Dow Industrials Futures down 50 points right now, a quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 down 3 points, and the NASDAQ lower by 1 and three quarters, stock finished positive yesterday.</p><p>The Dow added nearly 141 points on the session.  It was one-half of a percent higher at the close.  The S&amp;P was up 20 points, three quarters of a percent, as well as the NASDAQ, 53 points higher yesterday, at the close.</p><p>Global markets this morning, under some selling pressure, European Indices are down across the board, as you can see, FT-100 down 23, CAC Quarante down 20, and the DAX Index down 28.</p><p>Shares were mixed in Asia overnight, Japan was down two-tenths of a percent, as you see there, a quarter of a percent, but the biggest mover was China, Shanghai Composite up almost one percent.</p><p>In favor of cutting interest rates, Stephen Moore, President Trump's pick for the Federal Reserve board, reportedly says that rates should be cut immediately by half of a percentage point.</p><p>May's tough decision, meanwhile, British lawmakers are looking for a new strategy this morning, for the country to exit the E.U., with Prime Minister Theresa May facing pressure, now to step down.</p><p>Special delivery now, by drone, UPS beats out Amazon and FedEx with drone deliveries of medical supplies, we'll show you how it works.</p><p>And then, smart glasses, Huawei unveils glasses that are all about sound, yes, Huawei, coming out with those glasses.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, right now, Apple and Qualcomm's legal back and forth, a U.S. trade judge, ruling that the technology giant violated a Qualcomm patent in the manufacturing of certain older model iPhones and recommended an import ban on some iPhones.</p><p>At the same time, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor of Apple and invalidated a Qualcomm patent on battery-saving technology.  The two companies have been in a two-year long legal battle.  Qualcomm says that Apple owes billions of dollars in loyalties over technology used, in their iPhones.</p><p>Joining us now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director, Daniel Ives, Dan, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.  First, give us your reaction to this Qualcomm-Apple fight which keeps going on?</p><p>DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Yes, it's just another round in this 12-round heavyweight battle, I mean, there's (INAUDIBLE) Qualcomm feels like they have Apple against the ropes, in terms of some of the rulings they've gotten especially overseas.</p><p>You know, I think this was a bit of a gut punch to Qualcomm in terms of -- on the ITC ruling.  And I think, right now, this continues to be overhang on Apple because they continue to come out at the wrong time, given iPhone sales a phone off a cliff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We want to talk more about regulation and the potential of it.  Europe is obviously ahead of the U.S.  The E.U. continues to take on big tech, the European Union, backing copyright reforms targeting Facebook and Google.  They would require the companies to pay licensing fee to publishers for content posted on their platforms.</p><p>These new reforms also targeted copyrighted material by installing filters on the platforms, but, Dan, this is all on top of what we know to be hefty fines against Google, against other tech companies in Europe, much more aggressive in Europe than the U.S., will the U.S. follow suit at some point, do you think, and get a bigger government hand on tech?</p><p>IVES:  This is another anti-big tech measure.  I could tell you I talked to executives last night, a bunch from the valley, and these are nightmare who are ruling because from a copyright perspective, it's more lawyer-driven right around Brussels, but really anti-big tech.</p><p>We continue to think from GDPR to moves like the copyright, Europe continues to be much further ahead, regulatory wise, from the U.S., but look, with Warren and some others talking about breaking up big U.S. tech, that's something that investors are getting a little more worried about especially since we go into next election cycle.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Dan, let's go back to Apple for a second.  Investors have been talking about it nonstop since the media announcements this past week.  It seems to me that Qualcomm is not the overhang, is that ultimately, it was a whole home event, a lot of celebrities, very light on details.</p><p>And ultimately, if you look at five-day chart on the stock, the service's revenue is supposed to be to solve for the flattening of device sales, but people seem to think it's not going to happen now, agree or disagree on that?</p><p>IVES:  Oh, definitely, the battleground areas and services, we continue to look, 400, 450 billion of the valuation of services.  And when I look at the announcement this week, I viewed it as a step in the right direction, ultimately they are keeping the play book close to vest.</p><p>There's a lot of competition of Netflix and Disney, but otherwise, we continue to do see Apple does make a large content acquisition, that's going to be significant not just from a distribution platform but from original content.  That's the key right now for Cook and Cupertino with their back against the wall.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, it's Dagen McDowell, and I put out this crock pot theory, I think it was yesterday, that if investors become concerned about the growing competition from Apple and other content providers, that drives down Netflix stock.</p><p>That makes Netflix attractive potentially to Apple, sweeping them and buying them.  Do you think Apple ultimately tries to buy Netflix?</p><p>IVES:  Look, we have said the biggest strategic mistake that Apple and Cook have ever made, was not acquiring Netflix.  I think it's becoming clearer and clearer, it's around services and content.  That's why we believe that's still potential on the table.</p><p>But we view as CBS, Viacom, and A24 Lionsgate, as more likely in terms of the content acquisitions for Apple, even though they've never done historic M&amp;A.  Right now, we believe the clock struck 12:00.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, yes, I mean, you know, content is king right now.  Look at the billions being paid for original content.  What about the privacy issues around at Facebook?  I mean, this morning, the company is announcing it is cracking down on fake news, announcing it has removed more than 2,600 pages that are linked to fake accounts, the majority were tied to Russia and Iran.</p><p>But look, when you talk about fixes for the company's privacy issues, what does that mean?  I mean, this is their business model, right?  I mean, they sell data to advertisers, so can you really get out of what the issues are, without completely changing the business model?</p><p>IVES:  Well, look, and that's why Cox and the other executives have been revolving door and leaving, because as you play nice in the sand box to the bell weight in Brussels, you ruin your business model.  And I think that's the worry right here, is that, as you get more to privacy, it comes down to that's the worry for investors, that's why there's been the overhang here.</p><p>And I think there -- it's a fork in the road situation, they're going to have to kind of balance this because ultimately, especially when you look at what happened in Instagram and the messaging platform, that's going to be the key for Facebook, that's why in fang names, right now, you know, some queer overhangs, especially on the social media names, with Facebook front and center and a target on its back.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Dan, I mean, I think -- to add on to Maria's questions, so, I mean, how does Facebook deal with that, right?  The fact that they have to police the site, they have to get all these sort of fake accounts off the site.</p><p>They have to get these people buying fake sites off the site.  And at the same time, they have to make money off of ads.  I mean, how do they balance those two for the marketplace?</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  We believe it's content-driven and fundamentally, Facebook right now, they're going to have to draw more and more content on the platform, focus more and more on user engagement.  They're going to have to do these privacy issues, but it gets back to that is their core business model from an advertising perspective, that's what investors care about.</p><p>And that's also why even internally, at Facebook, that's what they care about.  And that's why Zuckerberg right now, there's a battle going on internally, where they have to continue to stick to their core knitting, otherwise, even there could be, you know, some nightmares days ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was just going to say, oh, so they are media companies, but they can't be sued for defamation under federal law?</p><p>And again, I brought this up, Devin Nunes' lawsuit against Twitter, it's pushing the legal boundaries of what is going on, because mid-'90s law, you cannot sue internet service providers and other companies because they don't technically create the content and aren't media companies, but they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but they are.</p><p>STEINBERG:  On Dan's last point, they don't want to stick to their knitting anymore.  Zuckerberg has come out and said now it's all going to be about private messaging.  This is his big of a shift, as post IPO, when they had to make the pivot to mobile.  And now, you're going to have to bet on a whole new company.  They're exiting this public arena.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not a whole new company, though, they are reckless with people's private information and I think that that's what investors know, and I think that's what the public knows, is you're saying it's private, but you can still see all of these messages and all of these communication.</p><p>And what are Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg going to actually do with that, do we trust them?  Somebody told me, doing business with them, like you cannot trust what they tell you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you mentioned Dan -- and you mentioned Devin Nunes and his lawsuit against Twitter, more are coming, I understand (INAUDIBLE) as well as the Daily Beast, he's going to be suing others, and he'll be joining us this week, by the way, to talk about it.  Dan Ives, it's good to see you this morning, thank you.</p><p>IVES:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll keep watching.  Meanwhile, a date has been set for Elon Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission to square off in court.  Lauren Simonetti on that story in headlines this morning, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We have the date, Maria, Elon Musk's contempt of court case, set for April 4th.  A federal judge in New York, hearing arguments on the SEC's claim the tweet, Musk, posted in February, violated terms of his fraud settlement, because Musk didn't get approval from Tesla.</p><p>UPS is making history today.  The company is testing drone deliveries of medical supplies to a hospital in North Carolina.  The flight marks the first commercial drone deliveries approved by FAA.  Drones will transport lab samples from hospitals to doctors' offices and so forth, getting them to their destinations much quicker than ground deliveries, essentially from 30 minutes to 3 minutes.</p><p>Huawei is teaming up with Gentle Monster, that's a Korean fashion brand.  They are set to release their first smart glasses.  You're looking at them.  If you buy a pair, you'll be able to listen to music and take phone calls simply by tapping the temple of the glasses, so you won't have to wear ear buds.</p><p>The glasses can be charged wirelessly, they go on sale in July.  We don't know how much they are going to cost.  Glasses -- smart glasses have struggled from other companies, we'll see if this one will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it spying on all your data and what comes up there, I mean, Huawei has its own issues, we know that, and the U.S. government is trying to ban Huawei telecom and technology from the U.S.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And if you're wearing something, is it, you know, spying on all the people around you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  What is it doing with that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll have to look at that.  Coming up, thank you, Lauren, eye on China trade, top U.S. officials back at the table this week, another round of talks with China, what can get done, we're going to get into it when we come back, and then tough decisions in the U.K. this morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May faces increasing pressure to step down, lawmakers there, looking for another strategy to exit the European Union, all ahead right here, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching negotiations between the U.S. and China.  Big week.  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing this morning ahead of high-level talks tomorrows.  Joining us right now to talk about what it means for markets and investing Tiger 21 Chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt.  It is good to see you this morning, Michael.</p><p>MICHAEL SONNENFELDT, CHAIRMAN, TIGER 21:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  What are your members doing in terms of allocating capital, how important is a China deal to them in terms of putting money to work in markets?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Well, first of all, our members have been shying away from China for all of the problems, rule of law being one of them but as far as the negotiations when our members think about their businesses, they've been getting stolen intellectual property.  It's hard to develop a product when fake product is in China within 24 hours.  So, on the intellectual property, that's got to have some progress and then you have tariffs and quotas, and we want to tamp it down because we know bad things happen when that gets out of control.  So, members who are running small businesses, they know that these are the two factors that they're looking at.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, we want to talk China this morning, we also going to talk rates.  Dagen, look at this 10-year yield which has happened in the last half an hour.  The yield has dropped below 2.4 percent, this is a big move here, down four basis points, what do you make of it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think some of this is a reaction to the comments of Steve Moore, who is the nominee to be on Federal Reserve Board by president.  Yes, to President Trump.  I almost said Obama.  President Trump trading in fed fund futures indicates a 70 percent -- 75 percent probability for a rate cut by the end of the year based on Steve Moore is saying that the Fed should cut rates.  So, this is very often when you see the yield curve invert where shorter term rates are higher.  This is telling you that the Fed will be cutting rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is this a positive or a negative?  I mean, look, rates being lowered is a good thing usually but if it's indicating things are a lot slower than anybody thought, do investors react negatively to that story?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Look, for my member's point of view, I was in a meeting yesterday where people are trying to make sense of this.  Most recessions are indicated by an inverted yield curves, not all inverted yield curves mean we have recession.  But it's a warning signal, it's one of those red flags.  So, clearly people are concerned about the Fed, but generally, the Fed has been high marks when you think about the changes at the Fed over the last year.  I think people are pleasantly surprised.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Michael, that's my question to you, which is usually, the inverted yield curve means a recession but we've never seen this level of whipsawing in interest rates and kind of reversal that's being messaged now.  Can we say the economy is fundamentally strong, that the removal of any chance of impeachment removes kind of the, the domestic overhang that could rattle the market and then ultimately, this is just a readjustment with the new Fed chairman?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  So, for business people, not economists trying to run small businesses, that is what our members are about.  They balance what you just said with the trillion-dollar deficit.  We've never had a trillion-dollar deficit.  So, it's like when you're pulling a rope.  Now, we have one in one direction and one in the other and nobody knows which part of that is going to win.  You can have the kind of trillion-dollar deficit even though the signals are pretty good right now.  The members in our group were saying it's kind of like being on thin ice: we're still skating, but it feels like the ice is getting thinner and thinner.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Michael, the question around this China trade thing that Maria brought up at the top of this segment, right, so I think the two issues you brought up both tariffs as well as intellectual property, seemed to be sticking point for China, right?  Because what China wants is immediate relief of the tariffs, but they don't really want to give up intellectual property which is why this negotiation have sort of hung on for so long.  So, how does the folks in your group see this, right, and what is the best outcome for them?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  I would say of all of the policy areas that are going on, the one where our members, which are businessmen, left, right, conservative, liberal, the ones that they concentrate on is the intellectual property.  If we don't break the back of this kind of activity, every time you invest, I have a company in Germany that we create little computers in the solar business.  Within 24 hours of a new product, a fake product is on the web in China.  You can't afford to make investments if every time you make an investment, it's stolen.  So, this is an absolute bedrock issue for any kind of basic business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I think the Trump administration knows that, but the question is: are they going to be able to put in some kind of an enforcement mechanism where they could just, you know, snap back tariffs or do something should China not follow through on its promises to stop stealing.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Well, certainly, our negotiator, Lighthizer, is one of the tough negotiators.  You got to give the administration credit for putting somebody in who has a spine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, we'll leave it there.  Michael, it's great to see you.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Michael Sonnenfeldt there.  Coming up, the search for more options: British Prime Minister Theresa May told to set a date for her departure as lawmakers consider alternative plans to leave the E.U.  That's next.  Back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  British lawmakers are voting on other option this is morning for the country's exit from the E.U.  Prime Minister Theresa May is now facing pressure to step down.  Ashley Webster with all the details right now.  Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hey, Maria, listen, she's been under pressure for a long time, Theresa May.  She will step down.  It's a matter of whether she can get her deal across the line, which she has not been able to do.  In fact, humiliating defeats twice now.  And if she can get it across the line, she will resign at that point too.  So, her future, we know, is outside of number 10 Downing Street.  The bigger issue, though, is how the heck they're going to break this deadlock in parliament.  They're going to be voting on 16 different options being proposed today, house speaker -- House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, the guy that shouts order, order.  He'll decide which ones will be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You sound like him.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Thank you very much.  He will decide which ones will be debated, he'll probably whittle it down to half a dozen.  But let's point this out, none of what happens today, the debate and the votes mean anything.  They are non-binding and Theresa May can completely ignore what they do today; it's just parliament saying, we've told you what we want to vote for but now, today, we're going to show you what we will vote for.  If there's a massive majority in parliament for one particular option that will put a lot of political pressure on Theresa May and she may be impossible for her to ignore.  But bottom line here is, you know, this is crunch time and she still doesn't have enough votes for her plans.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Ashley, will her deal get a third vote?  So, I mean, the speaker has already ruled that her deal wouldn't get up their vote like a couple -- a week or two ago.  Will her deal get a third vote now?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, it will because the E.U. has now put stipulations on it.  So, you could argue it's now in the different form.  There are reports that maybe a third time will happen this Friday symbolically because it's March 29th, the day that the U.K. was supposed to leave the E.U.  If not, sometime next week.  But by the way, these votes taking place today, these indicative votes will get whittled down and we could see another round of this next Monday, April Fool's Day, make of that what you will.  Bottom line is, this is going to be -- there's still a no-deal option on the table as far as Johnson said today.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Ashley, that's my question to you.  So, when I can't get over something, and I'm not doing something, my dad says: John, move on, move on, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>STEINBERG:  It's over.  They're Brexiting, move on.  Why can they not just get --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Because Theresa May's greatest quality is her persistence.  Her biggest problem is her persistence and her stubbornness.  She's kind of said, it's my way, these are my red lines, nothing changes.  Parliament has said, that's not good enough and that's where we're at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Wow, what a story.  Ashley, thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, coffee with the side of playtime.  We'll take you to unique coffee where you can cuddle with corgi.  Next hour right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, March 27th.  Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.

Good morning, everyone.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Wednesday.  It is Wednesday, March 27th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.  Safety in the sky, this morning, the Senate is holding a hearing today following the two deadly Boeing crashes, what to expect from that transportation hearing, as the 737 Max makes an emergency landing in Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Racing toward an IPO, Lyft reportedly seeing strong demand this morning as well.  The price shares above the range last night, the details ahead of Friday's opening trade.  And Green No Deal, the controversy plan -- controversial plan from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez failed in the Senate yesterday.  One Senator going viral for the posters that he used to slam that deal.  Plus, $750 million up for grabs tonight, that's the big Powerful drawing.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Futures are searching for direction this morning, we are looking at a lower opening for the broader averages, but fractionally.  Dow Industrials down about 45 points right now, S&amp;P 500 down two, and the NASDAQ down one.</p><p>Our top story this morning, lawmakers are focusing on aircraft safety this afternoon with a Senate Commerce subcommittee on aviation and space.  That hearing is following the deadly crashes of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet.  This, as the same model aircraft made an emergency landing in Florida yesterday after a reported engine problem.  Joining me right now is former FAA safety team representative and pilot, Kyle Bailey, is here.  Kyle, great to have you on the program.</p><p>KYLE BAILEY, SAFETY TEAM REPRESENTATIVE, FAA:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Tell us what you think is most important in the hearing today in terms of looking at this 737 jet?</p><p>BAILEY:  You know, I think as far as the FAA goes and with Boeing with the certification process, it really should be scrutinizing relationship they have, the two of them, if they're a little bit complacent, because Boeing really does a good job at the certification process.  And it will be interesting to see when they investigate, you know, how the two are working together, and are they a little bit too complacent?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  Because Boeing unveiled a software update today to fix this problem, and I guess it's the automated system, it was thought to have caused the 737's nose to tilt down in last October's Lion Air crash.  Can you explain a little about that and what the issue is?</p><p>BAILEY:  So, the system -- the software update, what that -- what that will do is there's an angle of attack indicator on the airplane.  One sensor was feeding into that, or one, you know, of the actual -- on the exterior of the airplane.  Now, two of those are going to feed into that sensor.  So, if one malfunctions, there will still be another one that is giving input.  So, there will be two in place of one.  Also, as far as that nose, the system pushing the nose down to make the airplane descend in a potential stall situation, the system will only do that a couple of times.  So, it will not be like the pilot will be struggling over and over and over again like, you know, what might have been the case previously.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significant is this for Boeing?  I mean, obviously, you're going to talk about major lawsuits coming at the company.  But do you think that this is a major problem for the business and for how it may have to redirect itself?</p><p>BAILEY:  Well, you know, keep in mind, Boeing isn't just in airplanes, they're also in the defense business, but as far as the airplane business goes, I mean, I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an important product.</p><p>BAILEY:  Yes.  And the passengers, in general, are you know, typically fearful of flying for the most part.  You know, they really have to build, you know, passenger confidence.  And it'll be very interesting to see how they do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can they do it?</p><p>BAILEY:  You know, it's hard.  I mean, they really just have to tell everybody what they're doing and prove everything.  And, you know, test this airplane, test the new software to make sure everything is doing what it should be doing.  So, now, you know, we've had two crashes already.  I mean -- so, they're going to do the software fix.  I mean, they really have to, you know, go out of their way to prove this to the general flying public that this stuff really does work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To really communicate that they are on the -- on the issue.  I'm worried about the FAA.  I mean, does it surprise you that the U.S. was really the last of -- you know, in the globe in terms of grounding this jet?</p><p>BAILEY:  Well, the FAA is very bureaucratic, but I have to say they do a fine job at what they do.  And they typically work on the facts and statistics, so they really don't care about media pressure, they don't care about pressure from the public.  I think this -- you know, incident might have changed things, but in general, they're pretty much facts and data-driven when they make decisions.  So -- but this would be the exception, though.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Kyle, it's great to have you, thanks so much.</p><p>BAILEY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for your insights on that.  Kyle Bailey there.  Meanwhile, IPOs are in focus, big year, Lyft reportedly will price its stock above the range, ahead of its IPO.  Dagen McDowell with more on that.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Lyft-off, let's call it.  So, Lyft is on its IPO road show at the moment, marketing the shares to potential investors, and it's been standing-room-only crowds, according to The Wall Street Journal.  The targeted range previously talked about was between $62.00 and $68.00 a share, and now it is expected to price above that level.  The Wall Street Journal says it's unlikely to be as high as $80, more likely to be in the low 70s.  Nevertheless, Lyft will be valued at more than $23 billion on a fully-diluted basis when it goes public.</p><p>Here's one of the interesting things, so most of the big private companies have large shareholders, mutual fund companies that already owned shares privately.  Lyft, not so much, with the exception of Fidelity Investments.  So, there's a lot of demand there from mutual fund companies, potentially for this IPO because they don't have a stake in the company before it goes public.  One concern is its profitability.  You're looking at some of the major IPOs to watch.</p><p>This is a good sign for, say, Pinterest, Uber that will follow Lyft.  And investors have told The Wall Street Journal, their concern is profitability, the path to profitability.  Lyft last year lost $911 million.  That was one of -- it was the biggest of any U.S. start-up in the 12 months preceding its IPO, the biggest lost there.  But nevertheless, people are interested in this company, Maria.</p><p>And by the way, we talked about LEVI, LEVI is still trading.  It went public, it was priced at $17.00 a share, it's trading at 22 bucks, that's a gain of 29 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, just in a couple of days, that was real successful.  And how about Uber, what is its valuation?  $120 billion or something on Uber.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A lot of upside here because Lyft is going to -- is promising that it's going to reduce its costs dramatically, reducing its insurance costs as it builds scale, so that's what they're telling investors about the path to profitability.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep talking about that.  See you in a bit, Dagen, thank you.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are facing backlash this morning after dropping all charges against actor Jussie Smollett.  Lauren Simonetti with those details now and headlines.  Lauren, what a story.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, wow!  Chicago's mayor and police chief both raising questions about why Smollett was not held accountable for allegedly faking a racist, anti-gay attack on himself to gain attention for his acting career.  Prosecutors say they dropped the charges after Smollett agreed to let the city keep its $10,000 in bail and to perform community service.  But Smollett may not be out of the woods just yet.  An investigation into a death threat letter the actor supposedly received prior to the alleged attack has been handed over to the FBI.</p><p>Take a look at this, shares of FiatChrysler trading sharply higher, up 3-1/2 percent in the premarket.  London's Financial Times is reporting that the company could be a takeover target once Renault restarts merger talks with Nissan, that in the coming months.  The newspaper says the move is a new strategy following the arrest of former Renault CEO and former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn on financial misconduct charges.  Ghosn, of course, has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>And it might be your lucky day, your chance to turn two bucks into 750 million.  Tonight's Powerball jackpot, the fourth largest in history if someone picks the lucky numbers.  They'll get a lump sum of $466 million before taxes.  We always like to let you know your odds, your odds of winning, 1 in 292 million.  There is a chance, Maria.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Lauren.  All right, quick break.  And then, coming up, Green No Deal, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's controversial Green New Deal fails test vote in the Senate yesterday as one Senator's poster against it goes viral.  We'll tell you about that one.  And then, battle of the drones, UPS is rolling out the first revenue-generating drone deliveries, beating out competition from Amazon and FedEx, much more on that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big program this morning, coming up.  Georgia Senator, member of the Senate Budget Banking, and Armed Services, and Agricultural Committees, David Perdue is with us this morning.  Tennessee Senator and a member of the subcommittee on Aviation and Space, Marsha Blackburn is here, she's going to be at that transportation hearing today.  Former adviser to President George W. Bush, Fox News Contributor Karl Rove joining us.  Along with the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" author Gordon Chang is with us, as U.S. officials head to Beijing -- oh, they are in Beijing already for another round of trade talks.  And Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Family Medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, \"Dr. Mike\" is here.  Breakout of measles to talk about with Mike.  You don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Green New Deal was denied yesterday.  The Senate voted 57-0 against a procedural motion to take up the resolution.  Most Democrats voted present to protest the GOP's action.  A fiery response by freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to push back from Congressman Sean Duffy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  The Green New Deal is one that if you're a rich liberal from maybe New York or California, it sounds great because you can afford to retrofit your home or build a new home that has zero emissions, that's energy efficient, affordable and safe.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitists?  Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, the founder and CEO of Cheddar, Jon Steinberg is here, along with New Leaders Senior Fellow, Fox News Contributor, Richard Fowler.  Dagen McDowell, that was some hearing yesterday on the Green New Deal, it looked like theatrics more than anything else.  How did you see them?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will not throw shade at a lady who can rock a red lip and uses her hands like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I kid.  This is interesting.  And my takeaway from just that comment from Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez when she was talking about -- she was talking about the dirty -- the water problems in Flint, Michigan and the South Bronx.  She is not pointing to something that the Green New Deal would necessarily fix.  She's pointing to problems that occur, say, in the South Bronx, this is one of the most socialist cities in the nation, where you have great government control and extremely high taxes, and you still have appalling conditions that people are living in.  With the Flint water crisis, again, this is something that the government did not prevent and did not stop.  So if she thinks that government is the solution, she just gave two examples of the government being the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What do you think, Richard?</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Listen, I think the Green New Deal was a -- is a framework, right?  Like I said, I don't think it's the perfect solution but here lies the problem.  So we saw -- and I'm pretty sure we'll show the clip later of Utah Senator Mike Lee showing all these pictures of -- I think Ronald Reagan sitting on top of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's take a look at this because that was Senator Mike Lee yesterday and it went viral.  His posters which slammed the Green New Deal.  Here is one example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH:  I rise today to consider the Green New Deal with the seriousness it deserves.  This is a picture of Aquaman, a superhero from the undersea kingdom of Atlantis.  I draw your attention, Mr. President, to the 20-foot impressive seahorse he's riding.  Under the Green New Deal, this is probably Hawaii's best bet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is pretty funny.</p><p>FOWLER:  It is funny and I'm pretty sure the Kinkos stocks should be going through the roof right now because he made a lot of -- he spent a lot in printing.  But here is the truth is that both the United Nations, the Congressional report, the fact is that climate change is a real thing, right?  And I think what we have on one side is the Green New Deal, I'm not saying it's the best solution but on the other side you have folks likes Senator Mike Lee saying that climate change, nothing to see here, nothing is happening and I think that is part of the problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch McConnell didn't know.  Mitch McConnell actually is now on the record as saying I'm talking about climate change.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER:  They haven't given any solutions and I think the solution exist sometimes in the middle when Democrats, Republican, businesses come together and say, OK, we have a problem here and that's actually trying to figure out some real solutions because the real problems like Super Storm Sandy flooding.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a nice thing to say that this is just a framework but it actually -- it is legislation that she would like to bring to the -- that she would like to see materialize, so it's not just a framework.</p><p>JON STEINBERG, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, CHEDDAR:  But to your point, Maria, it's basically nonexistent on facts right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>STEINBERG:  No one actually knows what's in the Green New Deal, the world is ending in 10 years, apparently it's causing asthma in New York City.  But what we've seen here is the politicians level of marketing skill has completely evolve.  I think largely as a result of President Trump, we have people now that know how to message, know how to use gimmicks, you've got presentations skills from somebody like AOC that are spectacular.</p><p>The way she presents, the way she speaks and we're entering sort of an area where this is what's going to define, you know, the movements that happened in this country.  This socialism thing is unbelievably dangerous whether it's the Green New Deal or the pied-a-terre tax or the -- under the real estate kill tax basically in New York City.  This kind of stuff is going to make things happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Green New Deal proposes explicitly retrofitting every house in America.  This is the Wall Street Journal's editorial today.  And eliminating fossil fuels within a decade.  That is higher energy cost, it will hurt lower-income Americans more than anyone else and our standard of living as a nation will suffer and they have to answer to that.  Instead all of these yesterday, Democratic presidential candidates voted present.  The Journal is calling it profiles and present which is hilarious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's -- that's the thing, I mean, you could say, yes, climate change is an issue, she could have just said that but to come up with this whole plan that is specific in terms of getting rid of fossil fuels in the next 10 years doesn't make any sense and that's why they're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER:  Yes.  I mean, I think the -- but the truth of the matter here is that her plan sits on one side and on the opposite side of the aisle there is nothing, there is no plan, there is zero, there is an empty box, right?  And I think if you look at -- if you look at recent polls you will see millennials in the Republican side are saying climate change is real and their party doesn't have an answer to that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the answer will be is that a carbon-free future is one -- is it creates a nation that you don't want to live in.</p><p>FOWLER:  But that's not coming from the President or the party.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you -- and also well, they -- we talk about it endlessly on this program and it is private industry that has not only lowered our emissions --</p><p>STEINBERG:  Absolutely, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- with the use of natural gas, it is private industry and getting out of the way of using and developing and discovering in a new way those very fossil fuels that are plentiful in this country that keep people's energy costs down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there is a plan and Corporate America has been executing that plant --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  Look at the electric car move, you know, we can -- you know, we all, you know, punch at Elon Musk for his craziness all day long.  He's done more to affect, you know, hybrid and electric vehicles in this country than any amount of legislation, any amount of tax credits.  He just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I forgot throw punches at Elon Musk although I think he's been a jerk in the past, I think that this is -- he ultimately by creating a cool car, he will get more people behind the wheel of the electric vehicle without AOC and her cronies telling us what kind of car to buy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  I tried to do solar, you can't get it done on your house.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you can't get it done on your car because the sun is now always shining.  We'll take a quick break.  When we come back.  The Federal Reserve is in focus.  President Trump's expected nominee Stephen Moore reportedly in favor of the Central Bank cutting rates at this point.  We're going to get into that.  And then time for a change.  Colorado's governor unveiling a new state logo.  But it's his look that's gone viral.  We'll be right back with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning.  The Las Vegas review Journal says that giving Nevada a raise, minimum wage of $12 is possible by 2024.  Proposed legislation raising minimum that wage to $12 an hour for workers not offered health insurance, $11 for those who are.  The increase would be gradual, 75 cents a year beginning in 2020.  Did you know Empire reporting an Alaska moose hunter can rev up his hovercraft according to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>Justices reeling at the National Park Service was wrong to ban John Sturgeon from using his hovercraft on a river running through a national preserve.  The panel decided the agency does not have the jurisdiction over that stretch of land.  The Denver post this morning writing, Governor Jarid Polis unveils new Colorado logo with a tree and a sea from the state flag.  He says the new look better reflects Colorado and will not cause taxpayers any more money.</p><p>The Governor wearing a winter hat featuring the colorful logo during his presentation and that hack up plenty of comments on social media.  Colorado's new logo.</p><p>FOWLER:  I like it.</p><p>STEINBERG:  He was my classmate at Princeton.  He was my classmate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that right?</p><p>STEINBERG:  Yes.  He was always doing like start-ups and all sort of stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's awesome.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Colorado is the coolest -- one of the coolest states in the country.  I lived there for a couple of years and it's -- I think it -- the people in Colorado are also the thinnest in the nation because they're so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  I want to ask you about the moose thing, OK?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  -- because you know -- because you've mentioned some of the outdoor stuff to me before in the green room.  Like isn't hunting a moose in a hovercraft won't actually the moose off?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is he hunting it?</p><p>STEINBERG:  He was hunting moose in the hovercraft, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that he was hunting, no.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Oh, he was just chasing those.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No. I think it was stretch of water.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a stretch of water.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It went through -- I don't know, I have to go read the story but I don't -- yes.  But it depends on how loud his hovercraft is.  I like how you turn to me from moose.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The moose story.</p><p>STEINBERG:  I will -- I will - you can keep both of those.  I'll stay right here in New York.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's my line of the day, don't hunt these majestic animals.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>STIREWALT:  I'm -- I concur.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, look, you know what I want to talk about with you later on in the show, this idea about socialism and you said it was dangerous some of these plans.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think it's so dangerous because people don't understand these are Federal programs and socialist program.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Because I think you have an entire generation of young people that don't know that socialism is breadlines basically that are having it sold by them and not another generation, not a counter kind of marketing message of how great capitalism.  I mean, Ken Langone's book, you know, I love capitalism, it was great, we need an AOC version of capitalism basically in terms of pitch.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back.  The technology battle.  Apple is facing iPhone sales bans in the United States after Qualcomm's patent ruling.  And then a special delivery.  UPS beats out Amazon and FedEx to roll out successful revenue generating drone deliveries.  We'll show you more when we come back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, March 27th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures are indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning.  Take a look, the Dow Industrials Futures down 50 points right now, a quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 down 3 points, and the NASDAQ lower by 1 and three quarters, stock finished positive yesterday.</p><p>The Dow added nearly 141 points on the session.  It was one-half of a percent higher at the close.  The S&amp;P was up 20 points, three quarters of a percent, as well as the NASDAQ, 53 points higher yesterday, at the close.</p><p>Global markets this morning, under some selling pressure, European Indices are down across the board, as you can see, FT-100 down 23, CAC Quarante down 20, and the DAX Index down 28.</p><p>Shares were mixed in Asia overnight, Japan was down two-tenths of a percent, as you see there, a quarter of a percent, but the biggest mover was China, Shanghai Composite up almost one percent.</p><p>In favor of cutting interest rates, Stephen Moore, President Trump's pick for the Federal Reserve board, reportedly says that rates should be cut immediately by half of a percentage point.</p><p>May's tough decision, meanwhile, British lawmakers are looking for a new strategy this morning, for the country to exit the E.U., with Prime Minister Theresa May facing pressure, now to step down.</p><p>Special delivery now, by drone, UPS beats out Amazon and FedEx with drone deliveries of medical supplies, we'll show you how it works.</p><p>And then, smart glasses, Huawei unveils glasses that are all about sound, yes, Huawei, coming out with those glasses.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, right now, Apple and Qualcomm's legal back and forth, a U.S. trade judge, ruling that the technology giant violated a Qualcomm patent in the manufacturing of certain older model iPhones and recommended an import ban on some iPhones.</p><p>At the same time, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor of Apple and invalidated a Qualcomm patent on battery-saving technology.  The two companies have been in a two-year long legal battle.  Qualcomm says that Apple owes billions of dollars in loyalties over technology used, in their iPhones.</p><p>Joining us now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director, Daniel Ives, Dan, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.  First, give us your reaction to this Qualcomm-Apple fight which keeps going on?</p><p>DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Yes, it's just another round in this 12-round heavyweight battle, I mean, there's (INAUDIBLE) Qualcomm feels like they have Apple against the ropes, in terms of some of the rulings they've gotten especially overseas.</p><p>You know, I think this was a bit of a gut punch to Qualcomm in terms of -- on the ITC ruling.  And I think, right now, this continues to be overhang on Apple because they continue to come out at the wrong time, given iPhone sales a phone off a cliff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We want to talk more about regulation and the potential of it.  Europe is obviously ahead of the U.S.  The E.U. continues to take on big tech, the European Union, backing copyright reforms targeting Facebook and Google.  They would require the companies to pay licensing fee to publishers for content posted on their platforms.</p><p>These new reforms also targeted copyrighted material by installing filters on the platforms, but, Dan, this is all on top of what we know to be hefty fines against Google, against other tech companies in Europe, much more aggressive in Europe than the U.S., will the U.S. follow suit at some point, do you think, and get a bigger government hand on tech?</p><p>IVES:  This is another anti-big tech measure.  I could tell you I talked to executives last night, a bunch from the valley, and these are nightmare who are ruling because from a copyright perspective, it's more lawyer-driven right around Brussels, but really anti-big tech.</p><p>We continue to think from GDPR to moves like the copyright, Europe continues to be much further ahead, regulatory wise, from the U.S., but look, with Warren and some others talking about breaking up big U.S. tech, that's something that investors are getting a little more worried about especially since we go into next election cycle.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Dan, let's go back to Apple for a second.  Investors have been talking about it nonstop since the media announcements this past week.  It seems to me that Qualcomm is not the overhang, is that ultimately, it was a whole home event, a lot of celebrities, very light on details.</p><p>And ultimately, if you look at five-day chart on the stock, the service's revenue is supposed to be to solve for the flattening of device sales, but people seem to think it's not going to happen now, agree or disagree on that?</p><p>IVES:  Oh, definitely, the battleground areas and services, we continue to look, 400, 450 billion of the valuation of services.  And when I look at the announcement this week, I viewed it as a step in the right direction, ultimately they are keeping the play book close to vest.</p><p>There's a lot of competition of Netflix and Disney, but otherwise, we continue to do see Apple does make a large content acquisition, that's going to be significant not just from a distribution platform but from original content.  That's the key right now for Cook and Cupertino with their back against the wall.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, it's Dagen McDowell, and I put out this crock pot theory, I think it was yesterday, that if investors become concerned about the growing competition from Apple and other content providers, that drives down Netflix stock.</p><p>That makes Netflix attractive potentially to Apple, sweeping them and buying them.  Do you think Apple ultimately tries to buy Netflix?</p><p>IVES:  Look, we have said the biggest strategic mistake that Apple and Cook have ever made, was not acquiring Netflix.  I think it's becoming clearer and clearer, it's around services and content.  That's why we believe that's still potential on the table.</p><p>But we view as CBS, Viacom, and A24 Lionsgate, as more likely in terms of the content acquisitions for Apple, even though they've never done historic M&amp;A.  Right now, we believe the clock struck 12:00.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, yes, I mean, you know, content is king right now.  Look at the billions being paid for original content.  What about the privacy issues around at Facebook?  I mean, this morning, the company is announcing it is cracking down on fake news, announcing it has removed more than 2,600 pages that are linked to fake accounts, the majority were tied to Russia and Iran.</p><p>But look, when you talk about fixes for the company's privacy issues, what does that mean?  I mean, this is their business model, right?  I mean, they sell data to advertisers, so can you really get out of what the issues are, without completely changing the business model?</p><p>IVES:  Well, look, and that's why Cox and the other executives have been revolving door and leaving, because as you play nice in the sand box to the bell weight in Brussels, you ruin your business model.  And I think that's the worry right here, is that, as you get more to privacy, it comes down to that's the worry for investors, that's why there's been the overhang here.</p><p>And I think there -- it's a fork in the road situation, they're going to have to kind of balance this because ultimately, especially when you look at what happened in Instagram and the messaging platform, that's going to be the key for Facebook, that's why in fang names, right now, you know, some queer overhangs, especially on the social media names, with Facebook front and center and a target on its back.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Dan, I mean, I think -- to add on to Maria's questions, so, I mean, how does Facebook deal with that, right?  The fact that they have to police the site, they have to get all these sort of fake accounts off the site.</p><p>They have to get these people buying fake sites off the site.  And at the same time, they have to make money off of ads.  I mean, how do they balance those two for the marketplace?</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  We believe it's content-driven and fundamentally, Facebook right now, they're going to have to draw more and more content on the platform, focus more and more on user engagement.  They're going to have to do these privacy issues, but it gets back to that is their core business model from an advertising perspective, that's what investors care about.</p><p>And that's also why even internally, at Facebook, that's what they care about.  And that's why Zuckerberg right now, there's a battle going on internally, where they have to continue to stick to their core knitting, otherwise, even there could be, you know, some nightmares days ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was just going to say, oh, so they are media companies, but they can't be sued for defamation under federal law?</p><p>And again, I brought this up, Devin Nunes' lawsuit against Twitter, it's pushing the legal boundaries of what is going on, because mid-'90s law, you cannot sue internet service providers and other companies because they don't technically create the content and aren't media companies, but they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but they are.</p><p>STEINBERG:  On Dan's last point, they don't want to stick to their knitting anymore.  Zuckerberg has come out and said now it's all going to be about private messaging.  This is his big of a shift, as post IPO, when they had to make the pivot to mobile.  And now, you're going to have to bet on a whole new company.  They're exiting this public arena.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not a whole new company, though, they are reckless with people's private information and I think that that's what investors know, and I think that's what the public knows, is you're saying it's private, but you can still see all of these messages and all of these communication.</p><p>And what are Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg going to actually do with that, do we trust them?  Somebody told me, doing business with them, like you cannot trust what they tell you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you mentioned Dan -- and you mentioned Devin Nunes and his lawsuit against Twitter, more are coming, I understand (INAUDIBLE) as well as the Daily Beast, he's going to be suing others, and he'll be joining us this week, by the way, to talk about it.  Dan Ives, it's good to see you this morning, thank you.</p><p>IVES:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll keep watching.  Meanwhile, a date has been set for Elon Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission to square off in court.  Lauren Simonetti on that story in headlines this morning, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We have the date, Maria, Elon Musk's contempt of court case, set for April 4th.  A federal judge in New York, hearing arguments on the SEC's claim the tweet, Musk, posted in February, violated terms of his fraud settlement, because Musk didn't get approval from Tesla.</p><p>UPS is making history today.  The company is testing drone deliveries of medical supplies to a hospital in North Carolina.  The flight marks the first commercial drone deliveries approved by FAA.  Drones will transport lab samples from hospitals to doctors' offices and so forth, getting them to their destinations much quicker than ground deliveries, essentially from 30 minutes to 3 minutes.</p><p>Huawei is teaming up with Gentle Monster, that's a Korean fashion brand.  They are set to release their first smart glasses.  You're looking at them.  If you buy a pair, you'll be able to listen to music and take phone calls simply by tapping the temple of the glasses, so you won't have to wear ear buds.</p><p>The glasses can be charged wirelessly, they go on sale in July.  We don't know how much they are going to cost.  Glasses -- smart glasses have struggled from other companies, we'll see if this one will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it spying on all your data and what comes up there, I mean, Huawei has its own issues, we know that, and the U.S. government is trying to ban Huawei telecom and technology from the U.S.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And if you're wearing something, is it, you know, spying on all the people around you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  What is it doing with that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll have to look at that.  Coming up, thank you, Lauren, eye on China trade, top U.S. officials back at the table this week, another round of talks with China, what can get done, we're going to get into it when we come back, and then tough decisions in the U.K. this morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May faces increasing pressure to step down, lawmakers there, looking for another strategy to exit the European Union, all ahead right here, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching negotiations between the U.S. and China.  Big week.  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing this morning ahead of high-level talks tomorrows.  Joining us right now to talk about what it means for markets and investing Tiger 21 Chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt.  It is good to see you this morning, Michael.</p><p>MICHAEL SONNENFELDT, CHAIRMAN, TIGER 21:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  What are your members doing in terms of allocating capital, how important is a China deal to them in terms of putting money to work in markets?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Well, first of all, our members have been shying away from China for all of the problems, rule of law being one of them but as far as the negotiations when our members think about their businesses, they've been getting stolen intellectual property.  It's hard to develop a product when fake product is in China within 24 hours.  So, on the intellectual property, that's got to have some progress and then you have tariffs and quotas, and we want to tamp it down because we know bad things happen when that gets out of control.  So, members who are running small businesses, they know that these are the two factors that they're looking at.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, we want to talk China this morning, we also going to talk rates.  Dagen, look at this 10-year yield which has happened in the last half an hour.  The yield has dropped below 2.4 percent, this is a big move here, down four basis points, what do you make of it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think some of this is a reaction to the comments of Steve Moore, who is the nominee to be on Federal Reserve Board by president.  Yes, to President Trump.  I almost said Obama.  President Trump trading in fed fund futures indicates a 70 percent -- 75 percent probability for a rate cut by the end of the year based on Steve Moore is saying that the Fed should cut rates.  So, this is very often when you see the yield curve invert where shorter term rates are higher.  This is telling you that the Fed will be cutting rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is this a positive or a negative?  I mean, look, rates being lowered is a good thing usually but if it's indicating things are a lot slower than anybody thought, do investors react negatively to that story?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Look, for my member's point of view, I was in a meeting yesterday where people are trying to make sense of this.  Most recessions are indicated by an inverted yield curves, not all inverted yield curves mean we have recession.  But it's a warning signal, it's one of those red flags.  So, clearly people are concerned about the Fed, but generally, the Fed has been high marks when you think about the changes at the Fed over the last year.  I think people are pleasantly surprised.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Michael, that's my question to you, which is usually, the inverted yield curve means a recession but we've never seen this level of whipsawing in interest rates and kind of reversal that's being messaged now.  Can we say the economy is fundamentally strong, that the removal of any chance of impeachment removes kind of the, the domestic overhang that could rattle the market and then ultimately, this is just a readjustment with the new Fed chairman?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  So, for business people, not economists trying to run small businesses, that is what our members are about.  They balance what you just said with the trillion-dollar deficit.  We've never had a trillion-dollar deficit.  So, it's like when you're pulling a rope.  Now, we have one in one direction and one in the other and nobody knows which part of that is going to win.  You can have the kind of trillion-dollar deficit even though the signals are pretty good right now.  The members in our group were saying it's kind of like being on thin ice: we're still skating, but it feels like the ice is getting thinner and thinner.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Michael, the question around this China trade thing that Maria brought up at the top of this segment, right, so I think the two issues you brought up both tariffs as well as intellectual property, seemed to be sticking point for China, right?  Because what China wants is immediate relief of the tariffs, but they don't really want to give up intellectual property which is why this negotiation have sort of hung on for so long.  So, how does the folks in your group see this, right, and what is the best outcome for them?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  I would say of all of the policy areas that are going on, the one where our members, which are businessmen, left, right, conservative, liberal, the ones that they concentrate on is the intellectual property.  If we don't break the back of this kind of activity, every time you invest, I have a company in Germany that we create little computers in the solar business.  Within 24 hours of a new product, a fake product is on the web in China.  You can't afford to make investments if every time you make an investment, it's stolen.  So, this is an absolute bedrock issue for any kind of basic business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I think the Trump administration knows that, but the question is: are they going to be able to put in some kind of an enforcement mechanism where they could just, you know, snap back tariffs or do something should China not follow through on its promises to stop stealing.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Well, certainly, our negotiator, Lighthizer, is one of the tough negotiators.  You got to give the administration credit for putting somebody in who has a spine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, we'll leave it there.  Michael, it's great to see you.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Michael Sonnenfeldt there.  Coming up, the search for more options: British Prime Minister Theresa May told to set a date for her departure as lawmakers consider alternative plans to leave the E.U.  That's next.  Back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  British lawmakers are voting on other option this is morning for the country's exit from the E.U.  Prime Minister Theresa May is now facing pressure to step down.  Ashley Webster with all the details right now.  Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hey, Maria, listen, she's been under pressure for a long time, Theresa May.  She will step down.  It's a matter of whether she can get her deal across the line, which she has not been able to do.  In fact, humiliating defeats twice now.  And if she can get it across the line, she will resign at that point too.  So, her future, we know, is outside of number 10 Downing Street.  The bigger issue, though, is how the heck they're going to break this deadlock in parliament.  They're going to be voting on 16 different options being proposed today, house speaker -- House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, the guy that shouts order, order.  He'll decide which ones will be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You sound like him.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Thank you very much.  He will decide which ones will be debated, he'll probably whittle it down to half a dozen.  But let's point this out, none of what happens today, the debate and the votes mean anything.  They are non-binding and Theresa May can completely ignore what they do today; it's just parliament saying, we've told you what we want to vote for but now, today, we're going to show you what we will vote for.  If there's a massive majority in parliament for one particular option that will put a lot of political pressure on Theresa May and she may be impossible for her to ignore.  But bottom line here is, you know, this is crunch time and she still doesn't have enough votes for her plans.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Ashley, will her deal get a third vote?  So, I mean, the speaker has already ruled that her deal wouldn't get up their vote like a couple -- a week or two ago.  Will her deal get a third vote now?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, it will because the E.U. has now put stipulations on it.  So, you could argue it's now in the different form.  There are reports that maybe a third time will happen this Friday symbolically because it's March 29th, the day that the U.K. was supposed to leave the E.U.  If not, sometime next week.  But by the way, these votes taking place today, these indicative votes will get whittled down and we could see another round of this next Monday, April Fool's Day, make of that what you will.  Bottom line is, this is going to be -- there's still a no-deal option on the table as far as Johnson said today.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Ashley, that's my question to you.  So, when I can't get over something, and I'm not doing something, my dad says: John, move on, move on, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>STEINBERG:  It's over.  They're Brexiting, move on.  Why can they not just get --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Because Theresa May's greatest quality is her persistence.  Her biggest problem is her persistence and her stubbornness.  She's kind of said, it's my way, these are my red lines, nothing changes.  Parliament has said, that's not good enough and that's where we're at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Wow, what a story.  Ashley, thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, coffee with the side of playtime.  We'll take you to unique coffee where you can cuddle with corgi.  Next hour right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, March 27th.  Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.

Good morning, everyone.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Wednesday.  It is Wednesday, March 27th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.  Safety in the sky, this morning, the Senate is holding a hearing today following the two deadly Boeing crashes, what to expect from that transportation hearing, as the 737 Max makes an emergency landing in Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Racing toward an IPO, Lyft reportedly seeing strong demand this morning as well.  The price shares above the range last night, the details ahead of Friday's opening trade.  And Green No Deal, the controversy plan -- controversial plan from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez failed in the Senate yesterday.  One Senator going viral for the posters that he used to slam that deal.  Plus, $750 million up for grabs tonight, that's the big Powerful drawing.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Futures are searching for direction this morning, we are looking at a lower opening for the broader averages, but fractionally.  Dow Industrials down about 45 points right now, S&amp;P 500 down two, and the NASDAQ down one.</p><p>Our top story this morning, lawmakers are focusing on aircraft safety this afternoon with a Senate Commerce subcommittee on aviation and space.  That hearing is following the deadly crashes of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet.  This, as the same model aircraft made an emergency landing in Florida yesterday after a reported engine problem.  Joining me right now is former FAA safety team representative and pilot, Kyle Bailey, is here.  Kyle, great to have you on the program.</p><p>KYLE BAILEY, SAFETY TEAM REPRESENTATIVE, FAA:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Tell us what you think is most important in the hearing today in terms of looking at this 737 jet?</p><p>BAILEY:  You know, I think as far as the FAA goes and with Boeing with the certification process, it really should be scrutinizing relationship they have, the two of them, if they're a little bit complacent, because Boeing really does a good job at the certification process.  And it will be interesting to see when they investigate, you know, how the two are working together, and are they a little bit too complacent?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  Because Boeing unveiled a software update today to fix this problem, and I guess it's the automated system, it was thought to have caused the 737's nose to tilt down in last October's Lion Air crash.  Can you explain a little about that and what the issue is?</p><p>BAILEY:  So, the system -- the software update, what that -- what that will do is there's an angle of attack indicator on the airplane.  One sensor was feeding into that, or one, you know, of the actual -- on the exterior of the airplane.  Now, two of those are going to feed into that sensor.  So, if one malfunctions, there will still be another one that is giving input.  So, there will be two in place of one.  Also, as far as that nose, the system pushing the nose down to make the airplane descend in a potential stall situation, the system will only do that a couple of times.  So, it will not be like the pilot will be struggling over and over and over again like, you know, what might have been the case previously.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significant is this for Boeing?  I mean, obviously, you're going to talk about major lawsuits coming at the company.  But do you think that this is a major problem for the business and for how it may have to redirect itself?</p><p>BAILEY:  Well, you know, keep in mind, Boeing isn't just in airplanes, they're also in the defense business, but as far as the airplane business goes, I mean, I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an important product.</p><p>BAILEY:  Yes.  And the passengers, in general, are you know, typically fearful of flying for the most part.  You know, they really have to build, you know, passenger confidence.  And it'll be very interesting to see how they do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can they do it?</p><p>BAILEY:  You know, it's hard.  I mean, they really just have to tell everybody what they're doing and prove everything.  And, you know, test this airplane, test the new software to make sure everything is doing what it should be doing.  So, now, you know, we've had two crashes already.  I mean -- so, they're going to do the software fix.  I mean, they really have to, you know, go out of their way to prove this to the general flying public that this stuff really does work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To really communicate that they are on the -- on the issue.  I'm worried about the FAA.  I mean, does it surprise you that the U.S. was really the last of -- you know, in the globe in terms of grounding this jet?</p><p>BAILEY:  Well, the FAA is very bureaucratic, but I have to say they do a fine job at what they do.  And they typically work on the facts and statistics, so they really don't care about media pressure, they don't care about pressure from the public.  I think this -- you know, incident might have changed things, but in general, they're pretty much facts and data-driven when they make decisions.  So -- but this would be the exception, though.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Kyle, it's great to have you, thanks so much.</p><p>BAILEY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for your insights on that.  Kyle Bailey there.  Meanwhile, IPOs are in focus, big year, Lyft reportedly will price its stock above the range, ahead of its IPO.  Dagen McDowell with more on that.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Lyft-off, let's call it.  So, Lyft is on its IPO road show at the moment, marketing the shares to potential investors, and it's been standing-room-only crowds, according to The Wall Street Journal.  The targeted range previously talked about was between $62.00 and $68.00 a share, and now it is expected to price above that level.  The Wall Street Journal says it's unlikely to be as high as $80, more likely to be in the low 70s.  Nevertheless, Lyft will be valued at more than $23 billion on a fully-diluted basis when it goes public.</p><p>Here's one of the interesting things, so most of the big private companies have large shareholders, mutual fund companies that already owned shares privately.  Lyft, not so much, with the exception of Fidelity Investments.  So, there's a lot of demand there from mutual fund companies, potentially for this IPO because they don't have a stake in the company before it goes public.  One concern is its profitability.  You're looking at some of the major IPOs to watch.</p><p>This is a good sign for, say, Pinterest, Uber that will follow Lyft.  And investors have told The Wall Street Journal, their concern is profitability, the path to profitability.  Lyft last year lost $911 million.  That was one of -- it was the biggest of any U.S. start-up in the 12 months preceding its IPO, the biggest lost there.  But nevertheless, people are interested in this company, Maria.</p><p>And by the way, we talked about LEVI, LEVI is still trading.  It went public, it was priced at $17.00 a share, it's trading at 22 bucks, that's a gain of 29 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, just in a couple of days, that was real successful.  And how about Uber, what is its valuation?  $120 billion or something on Uber.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A lot of upside here because Lyft is going to -- is promising that it's going to reduce its costs dramatically, reducing its insurance costs as it builds scale, so that's what they're telling investors about the path to profitability.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep talking about that.  See you in a bit, Dagen, thank you.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are facing backlash this morning after dropping all charges against actor Jussie Smollett.  Lauren Simonetti with those details now and headlines.  Lauren, what a story.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, wow!  Chicago's mayor and police chief both raising questions about why Smollett was not held accountable for allegedly faking a racist, anti-gay attack on himself to gain attention for his acting career.  Prosecutors say they dropped the charges after Smollett agreed to let the city keep its $10,000 in bail and to perform community service.  But Smollett may not be out of the woods just yet.  An investigation into a death threat letter the actor supposedly received prior to the alleged attack has been handed over to the FBI.</p><p>Take a look at this, shares of FiatChrysler trading sharply higher, up 3-1/2 percent in the premarket.  London's Financial Times is reporting that the company could be a takeover target once Renault restarts merger talks with Nissan, that in the coming months.  The newspaper says the move is a new strategy following the arrest of former Renault CEO and former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn on financial misconduct charges.  Ghosn, of course, has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>And it might be your lucky day, your chance to turn two bucks into 750 million.  Tonight's Powerball jackpot, the fourth largest in history if someone picks the lucky numbers.  They'll get a lump sum of $466 million before taxes.  We always like to let you know your odds, your odds of winning, 1 in 292 million.  There is a chance, Maria.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Lauren.  All right, quick break.  And then, coming up, Green No Deal, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's controversial Green New Deal fails test vote in the Senate yesterday as one Senator's poster against it goes viral.  We'll tell you about that one.  And then, battle of the drones, UPS is rolling out the first revenue-generating drone deliveries, beating out competition from Amazon and FedEx, much more on that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big program this morning, coming up.  Georgia Senator, member of the Senate Budget Banking, and Armed Services, and Agricultural Committees, David Perdue is with us this morning.  Tennessee Senator and a member of the subcommittee on Aviation and Space, Marsha Blackburn is here, she's going to be at that transportation hearing today.  Former adviser to President George W. Bush, Fox News Contributor Karl Rove joining us.  Along with the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" author Gordon Chang is with us, as U.S. officials head to Beijing -- oh, they are in Beijing already for another round of trade talks.  And Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Family Medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, \"Dr. Mike\" is here.  Breakout of measles to talk about with Mike.  You don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Green New Deal was denied yesterday.  The Senate voted 57-0 against a procedural motion to take up the resolution.  Most Democrats voted present to protest the GOP's action.  A fiery response by freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to push back from Congressman Sean Duffy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  The Green New Deal is one that if you're a rich liberal from maybe New York or California, it sounds great because you can afford to retrofit your home or build a new home that has zero emissions, that's energy efficient, affordable and safe.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitists?  Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, the founder and CEO of Cheddar, Jon Steinberg is here, along with New Leaders Senior Fellow, Fox News Contributor, Richard Fowler.  Dagen McDowell, that was some hearing yesterday on the Green New Deal, it looked like theatrics more than anything else.  How did you see them?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will not throw shade at a lady who can rock a red lip and uses her hands like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I kid.  This is interesting.  And my takeaway from just that comment from Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez when she was talking about -- she was talking about the dirty -- the water problems in Flint, Michigan and the South Bronx.  She is not pointing to something that the Green New Deal would necessarily fix.  She's pointing to problems that occur, say, in the South Bronx, this is one of the most socialist cities in the nation, where you have great government control and extremely high taxes, and you still have appalling conditions that people are living in.  With the Flint water crisis, again, this is something that the government did not prevent and did not stop.  So if she thinks that government is the solution, she just gave two examples of the government being the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What do you think, Richard?</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Listen, I think the Green New Deal was a -- is a framework, right?  Like I said, I don't think it's the perfect solution but here lies the problem.  So we saw -- and I'm pretty sure we'll show the clip later of Utah Senator Mike Lee showing all these pictures of -- I think Ronald Reagan sitting on top of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's take a look at this because that was Senator Mike Lee yesterday and it went viral.  His posters which slammed the Green New Deal.  Here is one example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH:  I rise today to consider the Green New Deal with the seriousness it deserves.  This is a picture of Aquaman, a superhero from the undersea kingdom of Atlantis.  I draw your attention, Mr. President, to the 20-foot impressive seahorse he's riding.  Under the Green New Deal, this is probably Hawaii's best bet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is pretty funny.</p><p>FOWLER:  It is funny and I'm pretty sure the Kinkos stocks should be going through the roof right now because he made a lot of -- he spent a lot in printing.  But here is the truth is that both the United Nations, the Congressional report, the fact is that climate change is a real thing, right?  And I think what we have on one side is the Green New Deal, I'm not saying it's the best solution but on the other side you have folks likes Senator Mike Lee saying that climate change, nothing to see here, nothing is happening and I think that is part of the problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch McConnell didn't know.  Mitch McConnell actually is now on the record as saying I'm talking about climate change.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER:  They haven't given any solutions and I think the solution exist sometimes in the middle when Democrats, Republican, businesses come together and say, OK, we have a problem here and that's actually trying to figure out some real solutions because the real problems like Super Storm Sandy flooding.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a nice thing to say that this is just a framework but it actually -- it is legislation that she would like to bring to the -- that she would like to see materialize, so it's not just a framework.</p><p>JON STEINBERG, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, CHEDDAR:  But to your point, Maria, it's basically nonexistent on facts right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>STEINBERG:  No one actually knows what's in the Green New Deal, the world is ending in 10 years, apparently it's causing asthma in New York City.  But what we've seen here is the politicians level of marketing skill has completely evolve.  I think largely as a result of President Trump, we have people now that know how to message, know how to use gimmicks, you've got presentations skills from somebody like AOC that are spectacular.</p><p>The way she presents, the way she speaks and we're entering sort of an area where this is what's going to define, you know, the movements that happened in this country.  This socialism thing is unbelievably dangerous whether it's the Green New Deal or the pied-a-terre tax or the -- under the real estate kill tax basically in New York City.  This kind of stuff is going to make things happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Green New Deal proposes explicitly retrofitting every house in America.  This is the Wall Street Journal's editorial today.  And eliminating fossil fuels within a decade.  That is higher energy cost, it will hurt lower-income Americans more than anyone else and our standard of living as a nation will suffer and they have to answer to that.  Instead all of these yesterday, Democratic presidential candidates voted present.  The Journal is calling it profiles and present which is hilarious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's -- that's the thing, I mean, you could say, yes, climate change is an issue, she could have just said that but to come up with this whole plan that is specific in terms of getting rid of fossil fuels in the next 10 years doesn't make any sense and that's why they're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER:  Yes.  I mean, I think the -- but the truth of the matter here is that her plan sits on one side and on the opposite side of the aisle there is nothing, there is no plan, there is zero, there is an empty box, right?  And I think if you look at -- if you look at recent polls you will see millennials in the Republican side are saying climate change is real and their party doesn't have an answer to that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the answer will be is that a carbon-free future is one -- is it creates a nation that you don't want to live in.</p><p>FOWLER:  But that's not coming from the President or the party.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you -- and also well, they -- we talk about it endlessly on this program and it is private industry that has not only lowered our emissions --</p><p>STEINBERG:  Absolutely, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- with the use of natural gas, it is private industry and getting out of the way of using and developing and discovering in a new way those very fossil fuels that are plentiful in this country that keep people's energy costs down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there is a plan and Corporate America has been executing that plant --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  Look at the electric car move, you know, we can -- you know, we all, you know, punch at Elon Musk for his craziness all day long.  He's done more to affect, you know, hybrid and electric vehicles in this country than any amount of legislation, any amount of tax credits.  He just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I forgot throw punches at Elon Musk although I think he's been a jerk in the past, I think that this is -- he ultimately by creating a cool car, he will get more people behind the wheel of the electric vehicle without AOC and her cronies telling us what kind of car to buy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  I tried to do solar, you can't get it done on your house.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you can't get it done on your car because the sun is now always shining.  We'll take a quick break.  When we come back.  The Federal Reserve is in focus.  President Trump's expected nominee Stephen Moore reportedly in favor of the Central Bank cutting rates at this point.  We're going to get into that.  And then time for a change.  Colorado's governor unveiling a new state logo.  But it's his look that's gone viral.  We'll be right back with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning.  The Las Vegas review Journal says that giving Nevada a raise, minimum wage of $12 is possible by 2024.  Proposed legislation raising minimum that wage to $12 an hour for workers not offered health insurance, $11 for those who are.  The increase would be gradual, 75 cents a year beginning in 2020.  Did you know Empire reporting an Alaska moose hunter can rev up his hovercraft according to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>Justices reeling at the National Park Service was wrong to ban John Sturgeon from using his hovercraft on a river running through a national preserve.  The panel decided the agency does not have the jurisdiction over that stretch of land.  The Denver post this morning writing, Governor Jarid Polis unveils new Colorado logo with a tree and a sea from the state flag.  He says the new look better reflects Colorado and will not cause taxpayers any more money.</p><p>The Governor wearing a winter hat featuring the colorful logo during his presentation and that hack up plenty of comments on social media.  Colorado's new logo.</p><p>FOWLER:  I like it.</p><p>STEINBERG:  He was my classmate at Princeton.  He was my classmate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that right?</p><p>STEINBERG:  Yes.  He was always doing like start-ups and all sort of stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's awesome.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Colorado is the coolest -- one of the coolest states in the country.  I lived there for a couple of years and it's -- I think it -- the people in Colorado are also the thinnest in the nation because they're so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  I want to ask you about the moose thing, OK?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  -- because you know -- because you've mentioned some of the outdoor stuff to me before in the green room.  Like isn't hunting a moose in a hovercraft won't actually the moose off?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is he hunting it?</p><p>STEINBERG:  He was hunting moose in the hovercraft, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that he was hunting, no.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Oh, he was just chasing those.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No. I think it was stretch of water.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a stretch of water.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It went through -- I don't know, I have to go read the story but I don't -- yes.  But it depends on how loud his hovercraft is.  I like how you turn to me from moose.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The moose story.</p><p>STEINBERG:  I will -- I will - you can keep both of those.  I'll stay right here in New York.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's my line of the day, don't hunt these majestic animals.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>STIREWALT:  I'm -- I concur.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, look, you know what I want to talk about with you later on in the show, this idea about socialism and you said it was dangerous some of these plans.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think it's so dangerous because people don't understand these are Federal programs and socialist program.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Because I think you have an entire generation of young people that don't know that socialism is breadlines basically that are having it sold by them and not another generation, not a counter kind of marketing message of how great capitalism.  I mean, Ken Langone's book, you know, I love capitalism, it was great, we need an AOC version of capitalism basically in terms of pitch.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back.  The technology battle.  Apple is facing iPhone sales bans in the United States after Qualcomm's patent ruling.  And then a special delivery.  UPS beats out Amazon and FedEx to roll out successful revenue generating drone deliveries.  We'll show you more when we come back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, March 27th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures are indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning.  Take a look, the Dow Industrials Futures down 50 points right now, a quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 down 3 points, and the NASDAQ lower by 1 and three quarters, stock finished positive yesterday.</p><p>The Dow added nearly 141 points on the session.  It was one-half of a percent higher at the close.  The S&amp;P was up 20 points, three quarters of a percent, as well as the NASDAQ, 53 points higher yesterday, at the close.</p><p>Global markets this morning, under some selling pressure, European Indices are down across the board, as you can see, FT-100 down 23, CAC Quarante down 20, and the DAX Index down 28.</p><p>Shares were mixed in Asia overnight, Japan was down two-tenths of a percent, as you see there, a quarter of a percent, but the biggest mover was China, Shanghai Composite up almost one percent.</p><p>In favor of cutting interest rates, Stephen Moore, President Trump's pick for the Federal Reserve board, reportedly says that rates should be cut immediately by half of a percentage point.</p><p>May's tough decision, meanwhile, British lawmakers are looking for a new strategy this morning, for the country to exit the E.U., with Prime Minister Theresa May facing pressure, now to step down.</p><p>Special delivery now, by drone, UPS beats out Amazon and FedEx with drone deliveries of medical supplies, we'll show you how it works.</p><p>And then, smart glasses, Huawei unveils glasses that are all about sound, yes, Huawei, coming out with those glasses.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, right now, Apple and Qualcomm's legal back and forth, a U.S. trade judge, ruling that the technology giant violated a Qualcomm patent in the manufacturing of certain older model iPhones and recommended an import ban on some iPhones.</p><p>At the same time, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor of Apple and invalidated a Qualcomm patent on battery-saving technology.  The two companies have been in a two-year long legal battle.  Qualcomm says that Apple owes billions of dollars in loyalties over technology used, in their iPhones.</p><p>Joining us now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director, Daniel Ives, Dan, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.  First, give us your reaction to this Qualcomm-Apple fight which keeps going on?</p><p>DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Yes, it's just another round in this 12-round heavyweight battle, I mean, there's (INAUDIBLE) Qualcomm feels like they have Apple against the ropes, in terms of some of the rulings they've gotten especially overseas.</p><p>You know, I think this was a bit of a gut punch to Qualcomm in terms of -- on the ITC ruling.  And I think, right now, this continues to be overhang on Apple because they continue to come out at the wrong time, given iPhone sales a phone off a cliff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We want to talk more about regulation and the potential of it.  Europe is obviously ahead of the U.S.  The E.U. continues to take on big tech, the European Union, backing copyright reforms targeting Facebook and Google.  They would require the companies to pay licensing fee to publishers for content posted on their platforms.</p><p>These new reforms also targeted copyrighted material by installing filters on the platforms, but, Dan, this is all on top of what we know to be hefty fines against Google, against other tech companies in Europe, much more aggressive in Europe than the U.S., will the U.S. follow suit at some point, do you think, and get a bigger government hand on tech?</p><p>IVES:  This is another anti-big tech measure.  I could tell you I talked to executives last night, a bunch from the valley, and these are nightmare who are ruling because from a copyright perspective, it's more lawyer-driven right around Brussels, but really anti-big tech.</p><p>We continue to think from GDPR to moves like the copyright, Europe continues to be much further ahead, regulatory wise, from the U.S., but look, with Warren and some others talking about breaking up big U.S. tech, that's something that investors are getting a little more worried about especially since we go into next election cycle.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Dan, let's go back to Apple for a second.  Investors have been talking about it nonstop since the media announcements this past week.  It seems to me that Qualcomm is not the overhang, is that ultimately, it was a whole home event, a lot of celebrities, very light on details.</p><p>And ultimately, if you look at five-day chart on the stock, the service's revenue is supposed to be to solve for the flattening of device sales, but people seem to think it's not going to happen now, agree or disagree on that?</p><p>IVES:  Oh, definitely, the battleground areas and services, we continue to look, 400, 450 billion of the valuation of services.  And when I look at the announcement this week, I viewed it as a step in the right direction, ultimately they are keeping the play book close to vest.</p><p>There's a lot of competition of Netflix and Disney, but otherwise, we continue to do see Apple does make a large content acquisition, that's going to be significant not just from a distribution platform but from original content.  That's the key right now for Cook and Cupertino with their back against the wall.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, it's Dagen McDowell, and I put out this crock pot theory, I think it was yesterday, that if investors become concerned about the growing competition from Apple and other content providers, that drives down Netflix stock.</p><p>That makes Netflix attractive potentially to Apple, sweeping them and buying them.  Do you think Apple ultimately tries to buy Netflix?</p><p>IVES:  Look, we have said the biggest strategic mistake that Apple and Cook have ever made, was not acquiring Netflix.  I think it's becoming clearer and clearer, it's around services and content.  That's why we believe that's still potential on the table.</p><p>But we view as CBS, Viacom, and A24 Lionsgate, as more likely in terms of the content acquisitions for Apple, even though they've never done historic M&amp;A.  Right now, we believe the clock struck 12:00.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, yes, I mean, you know, content is king right now.  Look at the billions being paid for original content.  What about the privacy issues around at Facebook?  I mean, this morning, the company is announcing it is cracking down on fake news, announcing it has removed more than 2,600 pages that are linked to fake accounts, the majority were tied to Russia and Iran.</p><p>But look, when you talk about fixes for the company's privacy issues, what does that mean?  I mean, this is their business model, right?  I mean, they sell data to advertisers, so can you really get out of what the issues are, without completely changing the business model?</p><p>IVES:  Well, look, and that's why Cox and the other executives have been revolving door and leaving, because as you play nice in the sand box to the bell weight in Brussels, you ruin your business model.  And I think that's the worry right here, is that, as you get more to privacy, it comes down to that's the worry for investors, that's why there's been the overhang here.</p><p>And I think there -- it's a fork in the road situation, they're going to have to kind of balance this because ultimately, especially when you look at what happened in Instagram and the messaging platform, that's going to be the key for Facebook, that's why in fang names, right now, you know, some queer overhangs, especially on the social media names, with Facebook front and center and a target on its back.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Dan, I mean, I think -- to add on to Maria's questions, so, I mean, how does Facebook deal with that, right?  The fact that they have to police the site, they have to get all these sort of fake accounts off the site.</p><p>They have to get these people buying fake sites off the site.  And at the same time, they have to make money off of ads.  I mean, how do they balance those two for the marketplace?</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  We believe it's content-driven and fundamentally, Facebook right now, they're going to have to draw more and more content on the platform, focus more and more on user engagement.  They're going to have to do these privacy issues, but it gets back to that is their core business model from an advertising perspective, that's what investors care about.</p><p>And that's also why even internally, at Facebook, that's what they care about.  And that's why Zuckerberg right now, there's a battle going on internally, where they have to continue to stick to their core knitting, otherwise, even there could be, you know, some nightmares days ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was just going to say, oh, so they are media companies, but they can't be sued for defamation under federal law?</p><p>And again, I brought this up, Devin Nunes' lawsuit against Twitter, it's pushing the legal boundaries of what is going on, because mid-'90s law, you cannot sue internet service providers and other companies because they don't technically create the content and aren't media companies, but they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but they are.</p><p>STEINBERG:  On Dan's last point, they don't want to stick to their knitting anymore.  Zuckerberg has come out and said now it's all going to be about private messaging.  This is his big of a shift, as post IPO, when they had to make the pivot to mobile.  And now, you're going to have to bet on a whole new company.  They're exiting this public arena.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not a whole new company, though, they are reckless with people's private information and I think that that's what investors know, and I think that's what the public knows, is you're saying it's private, but you can still see all of these messages and all of these communication.</p><p>And what are Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg going to actually do with that, do we trust them?  Somebody told me, doing business with them, like you cannot trust what they tell you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you mentioned Dan -- and you mentioned Devin Nunes and his lawsuit against Twitter, more are coming, I understand (INAUDIBLE) as well as the Daily Beast, he's going to be suing others, and he'll be joining us this week, by the way, to talk about it.  Dan Ives, it's good to see you this morning, thank you.</p><p>IVES:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll keep watching.  Meanwhile, a date has been set for Elon Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission to square off in court.  Lauren Simonetti on that story in headlines this morning, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We have the date, Maria, Elon Musk's contempt of court case, set for April 4th.  A federal judge in New York, hearing arguments on the SEC's claim the tweet, Musk, posted in February, violated terms of his fraud settlement, because Musk didn't get approval from Tesla.</p><p>UPS is making history today.  The company is testing drone deliveries of medical supplies to a hospital in North Carolina.  The flight marks the first commercial drone deliveries approved by FAA.  Drones will transport lab samples from hospitals to doctors' offices and so forth, getting them to their destinations much quicker than ground deliveries, essentially from 30 minutes to 3 minutes.</p><p>Huawei is teaming up with Gentle Monster, that's a Korean fashion brand.  They are set to release their first smart glasses.  You're looking at them.  If you buy a pair, you'll be able to listen to music and take phone calls simply by tapping the temple of the glasses, so you won't have to wear ear buds.</p><p>The glasses can be charged wirelessly, they go on sale in July.  We don't know how much they are going to cost.  Glasses -- smart glasses have struggled from other companies, we'll see if this one will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it spying on all your data and what comes up there, I mean, Huawei has its own issues, we know that, and the U.S. government is trying to ban Huawei telecom and technology from the U.S.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And if you're wearing something, is it, you know, spying on all the people around you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  What is it doing with that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll have to look at that.  Coming up, thank you, Lauren, eye on China trade, top U.S. officials back at the table this week, another round of talks with China, what can get done, we're going to get into it when we come back, and then tough decisions in the U.K. this morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May faces increasing pressure to step down, lawmakers there, looking for another strategy to exit the European Union, all ahead right here, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching negotiations between the U.S. and China.  Big week.  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing this morning ahead of high-level talks tomorrows.  Joining us right now to talk about what it means for markets and investing Tiger 21 Chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt.  It is good to see you this morning, Michael.</p><p>MICHAEL SONNENFELDT, CHAIRMAN, TIGER 21:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  What are your members doing in terms of allocating capital, how important is a China deal to them in terms of putting money to work in markets?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Well, first of all, our members have been shying away from China for all of the problems, rule of law being one of them but as far as the negotiations when our members think about their businesses, they've been getting stolen intellectual property.  It's hard to develop a product when fake product is in China within 24 hours.  So, on the intellectual property, that's got to have some progress and then you have tariffs and quotas, and we want to tamp it down because we know bad things happen when that gets out of control.  So, members who are running small businesses, they know that these are the two factors that they're looking at.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, we want to talk China this morning, we also going to talk rates.  Dagen, look at this 10-year yield which has happened in the last half an hour.  The yield has dropped below 2.4 percent, this is a big move here, down four basis points, what do you make of it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think some of this is a reaction to the comments of Steve Moore, who is the nominee to be on Federal Reserve Board by president.  Yes, to President Trump.  I almost said Obama.  President Trump trading in fed fund futures indicates a 70 percent -- 75 percent probability for a rate cut by the end of the year based on Steve Moore is saying that the Fed should cut rates.  So, this is very often when you see the yield curve invert where shorter term rates are higher.  This is telling you that the Fed will be cutting rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is this a positive or a negative?  I mean, look, rates being lowered is a good thing usually but if it's indicating things are a lot slower than anybody thought, do investors react negatively to that story?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Look, for my member's point of view, I was in a meeting yesterday where people are trying to make sense of this.  Most recessions are indicated by an inverted yield curves, not all inverted yield curves mean we have recession.  But it's a warning signal, it's one of those red flags.  So, clearly people are concerned about the Fed, but generally, the Fed has been high marks when you think about the changes at the Fed over the last year.  I think people are pleasantly surprised.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Michael, that's my question to you, which is usually, the inverted yield curve means a recession but we've never seen this level of whipsawing in interest rates and kind of reversal that's being messaged now.  Can we say the economy is fundamentally strong, that the removal of any chance of impeachment removes kind of the, the domestic overhang that could rattle the market and then ultimately, this is just a readjustment with the new Fed chairman?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  So, for business people, not economists trying to run small businesses, that is what our members are about.  They balance what you just said with the trillion-dollar deficit.  We've never had a trillion-dollar deficit.  So, it's like when you're pulling a rope.  Now, we have one in one direction and one in the other and nobody knows which part of that is going to win.  You can have the kind of trillion-dollar deficit even though the signals are pretty good right now.  The members in our group were saying it's kind of like being on thin ice: we're still skating, but it feels like the ice is getting thinner and thinner.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Michael, the question around this China trade thing that Maria brought up at the top of this segment, right, so I think the two issues you brought up both tariffs as well as intellectual property, seemed to be sticking point for China, right?  Because what China wants is immediate relief of the tariffs, but they don't really want to give up intellectual property which is why this negotiation have sort of hung on for so long.  So, how does the folks in your group see this, right, and what is the best outcome for them?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  I would say of all of the policy areas that are going on, the one where our members, which are businessmen, left, right, conservative, liberal, the ones that they concentrate on is the intellectual property.  If we don't break the back of this kind of activity, every time you invest, I have a company in Germany that we create little computers in the solar business.  Within 24 hours of a new product, a fake product is on the web in China.  You can't afford to make investments if every time you make an investment, it's stolen.  So, this is an absolute bedrock issue for any kind of basic business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I think the Trump administration knows that, but the question is: are they going to be able to put in some kind of an enforcement mechanism where they could just, you know, snap back tariffs or do something should China not follow through on its promises to stop stealing.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Well, certainly, our negotiator, Lighthizer, is one of the tough negotiators.  You got to give the administration credit for putting somebody in who has a spine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, we'll leave it there.  Michael, it's great to see you.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Michael Sonnenfeldt there.  Coming up, the search for more options: British Prime Minister Theresa May told to set a date for her departure as lawmakers consider alternative plans to leave the E.U.  That's next.  Back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  British lawmakers are voting on other option this is morning for the country's exit from the E.U.  Prime Minister Theresa May is now facing pressure to step down.  Ashley Webster with all the details right now.  Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hey, Maria, listen, she's been under pressure for a long time, Theresa May.  She will step down.  It's a matter of whether she can get her deal across the line, which she has not been able to do.  In fact, humiliating defeats twice now.  And if she can get it across the line, she will resign at that point too.  So, her future, we know, is outside of number 10 Downing Street.  The bigger issue, though, is how the heck they're going to break this deadlock in parliament.  They're going to be voting on 16 different options being proposed today, house speaker -- House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, the guy that shouts order, order.  He'll decide which ones will be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You sound like him.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Thank you very much.  He will decide which ones will be debated, he'll probably whittle it down to half a dozen.  But let's point this out, none of what happens today, the debate and the votes mean anything.  They are non-binding and Theresa May can completely ignore what they do today; it's just parliament saying, we've told you what we want to vote for but now, today, we're going to show you what we will vote for.  If there's a massive majority in parliament for one particular option that will put a lot of political pressure on Theresa May and she may be impossible for her to ignore.  But bottom line here is, you know, this is crunch time and she still doesn't have enough votes for her plans.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Ashley, will her deal get a third vote?  So, I mean, the speaker has already ruled that her deal wouldn't get up their vote like a couple -- a week or two ago.  Will her deal get a third vote now?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, it will because the E.U. has now put stipulations on it.  So, you could argue it's now in the different form.  There are reports that maybe a third time will happen this Friday symbolically because it's March 29th, the day that the U.K. was supposed to leave the E.U.  If not, sometime next week.  But by the way, these votes taking place today, these indicative votes will get whittled down and we could see another round of this next Monday, April Fool's Day, make of that what you will.  Bottom line is, this is going to be -- there's still a no-deal option on the table as far as Johnson said today.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Ashley, that's my question to you.  So, when I can't get over something, and I'm not doing something, my dad says: John, move on, move on, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>STEINBERG:  It's over.  They're Brexiting, move on.  Why can they not just get --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Because Theresa May's greatest quality is her persistence.  Her biggest problem is her persistence and her stubbornness.  She's kind of said, it's my way, these are my red lines, nothing changes.  Parliament has said, that's not good enough and that's where we're at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Wow, what a story.  Ashley, thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, coffee with the side of playtime.  We'll take you to unique coffee where you can cuddle with corgi.  Next hour right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, March 27th.  Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  A timetable for the release, a new report says that the public could see a version of the Mueller report within weeks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It could not have been better --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2198648865</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8B-GB61-DY0W-42WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning, everyone.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Wednesday.  It is Wednesday, March 27th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.  Safety in the sky, this morning, the Senate is holding a hearing today following the two deadly Boeing crashes, what to expect from that transportation hearing, as the 737 Max makes an emergency landing in Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Racing toward an IPO, Lyft reportedly seeing strong demand this morning as well.  The price shares above the range last night, the details ahead of Friday's opening trade.  And Green No Deal, the controversy plan -- controversial plan from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez failed in the Senate yesterday.  One Senator going viral for the posters that he used to slam that deal.  Plus, $750 million up for grabs tonight, that's the big Powerful drawing.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Futures are searching for direction this morning, we are looking at a lower opening for the broader averages, but fractionally.  Dow Industrials down about 45 points right now, S&amp;P 500 down two, and the NASDAQ down one.</p><p>Our top story this morning, lawmakers are focusing on aircraft safety this afternoon with a Senate Commerce subcommittee on aviation and space.  That hearing is following the deadly crashes of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet.  This, as the same model aircraft made an emergency landing in Florida yesterday after a reported engine problem.  Joining me right now is former FAA safety team representative and pilot, Kyle Bailey, is here.  Kyle, great to have you on the program.</p><p>KYLE BAILEY, SAFETY TEAM REPRESENTATIVE, FAA:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Tell us what you think is most important in the hearing today in terms of looking at this 737 jet?</p><p>BAILEY:  You know, I think as far as the FAA goes and with Boeing with the certification process, it really should be scrutinizing relationship they have, the two of them, if they're a little bit complacent, because Boeing really does a good job at the certification process.  And it will be interesting to see when they investigate, you know, how the two are working together, and are they a little bit too complacent?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  Because Boeing unveiled a software update today to fix this problem, and I guess it's the automated system, it was thought to have caused the 737's nose to tilt down in last October's Lion Air crash.  Can you explain a little about that and what the issue is?</p><p>BAILEY:  So, the system -- the software update, what that -- what that will do is there's an angle of attack indicator on the airplane.  One sensor was feeding into that, or one, you know, of the actual -- on the exterior of the airplane.  Now, two of those are going to feed into that sensor.  So, if one malfunctions, there will still be another one that is giving input.  So, there will be two in place of one.  Also, as far as that nose, the system pushing the nose down to make the airplane descend in a potential stall situation, the system will only do that a couple of times.  So, it will not be like the pilot will be struggling over and over and over again like, you know, what might have been the case previously.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significant is this for Boeing?  I mean, obviously, you're going to talk about major lawsuits coming at the company.  But do you think that this is a major problem for the business and for how it may have to redirect itself?</p><p>BAILEY:  Well, you know, keep in mind, Boeing isn't just in airplanes, they're also in the defense business, but as far as the airplane business goes, I mean, I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an important product.</p><p>BAILEY:  Yes.  And the passengers, in general, are you know, typically fearful of flying for the most part.  You know, they really have to build, you know, passenger confidence.  And it'll be very interesting to see how they do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can they do it?</p><p>BAILEY:  You know, it's hard.  I mean, they really just have to tell everybody what they're doing and prove everything.  And, you know, test this airplane, test the new software to make sure everything is doing what it should be doing.  So, now, you know, we've had two crashes already.  I mean -- so, they're going to do the software fix.  I mean, they really have to, you know, go out of their way to prove this to the general flying public that this stuff really does work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To really communicate that they are on the -- on the issue.  I'm worried about the FAA.  I mean, does it surprise you that the U.S. was really the last of -- you know, in the globe in terms of grounding this jet?</p><p>BAILEY:  Well, the FAA is very bureaucratic, but I have to say they do a fine job at what they do.  And they typically work on the facts and statistics, so they really don't care about media pressure, they don't care about pressure from the public.  I think this -- you know, incident might have changed things, but in general, they're pretty much facts and data-driven when they make decisions.  So -- but this would be the exception, though.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Kyle, it's great to have you, thanks so much.</p><p>BAILEY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for your insights on that.  Kyle Bailey there.  Meanwhile, IPOs are in focus, big year, Lyft reportedly will price its stock above the range, ahead of its IPO.  Dagen McDowell with more on that.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Lyft-off, let's call it.  So, Lyft is on its IPO road show at the moment, marketing the shares to potential investors, and it's been standing-room-only crowds, according to The Wall Street Journal.  The targeted range previously talked about was between $62.00 and $68.00 a share, and now it is expected to price above that level.  The Wall Street Journal says it's unlikely to be as high as $80, more likely to be in the low 70s.  Nevertheless, Lyft will be valued at more than $23 billion on a fully-diluted basis when it goes public.</p><p>Here's one of the interesting things, so most of the big private companies have large shareholders, mutual fund companies that already owned shares privately.  Lyft, not so much, with the exception of Fidelity Investments.  So, there's a lot of demand there from mutual fund companies, potentially for this IPO because they don't have a stake in the company before it goes public.  One concern is its profitability.  You're looking at some of the major IPOs to watch.</p><p>This is a good sign for, say, Pinterest, Uber that will follow Lyft.  And investors have told The Wall Street Journal, their concern is profitability, the path to profitability.  Lyft last year lost $911 million.  That was one of -- it was the biggest of any U.S. start-up in the 12 months preceding its IPO, the biggest lost there.  But nevertheless, people are interested in this company, Maria.</p><p>And by the way, we talked about LEVI, LEVI is still trading.  It went public, it was priced at $17.00 a share, it's trading at 22 bucks, that's a gain of 29 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, just in a couple of days, that was real successful.  And how about Uber, what is its valuation?  $120 billion or something on Uber.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A lot of upside here because Lyft is going to -- is promising that it's going to reduce its costs dramatically, reducing its insurance costs as it builds scale, so that's what they're telling investors about the path to profitability.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep talking about that.  See you in a bit, Dagen, thank you.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are facing backlash this morning after dropping all charges against actor Jussie Smollett.  Lauren Simonetti with those details now and headlines.  Lauren, what a story.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, wow!  Chicago's mayor and police chief both raising questions about why Smollett was not held accountable for allegedly faking a racist, anti-gay attack on himself to gain attention for his acting career.  Prosecutors say they dropped the charges after Smollett agreed to let the city keep its $10,000 in bail and to perform community service.  But Smollett may not be out of the woods just yet.  An investigation into a death threat letter the actor supposedly received prior to the alleged attack has been handed over to the FBI.</p><p>Take a look at this, shares of FiatChrysler trading sharply higher, up 3-1/2 percent in the premarket.  London's Financial Times is reporting that the company could be a takeover target once Renault restarts merger talks with Nissan, that in the coming months.  The newspaper says the move is a new strategy following the arrest of former Renault CEO and former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn on financial misconduct charges.  Ghosn, of course, has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>And it might be your lucky day, your chance to turn two bucks into 750 million.  Tonight's Powerball jackpot, the fourth largest in history if someone picks the lucky numbers.  They'll get a lump sum of $466 million before taxes.  We always like to let you know your odds, your odds of winning, 1 in 292 million.  There is a chance, Maria.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Lauren.  All right, quick break.  And then, coming up, Green No Deal, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's controversial Green New Deal fails test vote in the Senate yesterday as one Senator's poster against it goes viral.  We'll tell you about that one.  And then, battle of the drones, UPS is rolling out the first revenue-generating drone deliveries, beating out competition from Amazon and FedEx, much more on that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big program this morning, coming up.  Georgia Senator, member of the Senate Budget Banking, and Armed Services, and Agricultural Committees, David Perdue is with us this morning.  Tennessee Senator and a member of the subcommittee on Aviation and Space, Marsha Blackburn is here, she's going to be at that transportation hearing today.  Former adviser to President George W. Bush, Fox News Contributor Karl Rove joining us.  Along with the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" author Gordon Chang is with us, as U.S. officials head to Beijing -- oh, they are in Beijing already for another round of trade talks.  And Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Family Medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, \"Dr. Mike\" is here.  Breakout of measles to talk about with Mike.  You don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Green New Deal was denied yesterday.  The Senate voted 57-0 against a procedural motion to take up the resolution.  Most Democrats voted present to protest the GOP's action.  A fiery response by freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to push back from Congressman Sean Duffy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  The Green New Deal is one that if you're a rich liberal from maybe New York or California, it sounds great because you can afford to retrofit your home or build a new home that has zero emissions, that's energy efficient, affordable and safe.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitists?  Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining the conversation this morning, the founder and CEO of Cheddar, Jon Steinberg is here, along with New Leaders Senior Fellow, Fox News Contributor, Richard Fowler.  Dagen McDowell, that was some hearing yesterday on the Green New Deal, it looked like theatrics more than anything else.  How did you see them?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will not throw shade at a lady who can rock a red lip and uses her hands like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I kid.  This is interesting.  And my takeaway from just that comment from Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez when she was talking about -- she was talking about the dirty -- the water problems in Flint, Michigan and the South Bronx.  She is not pointing to something that the Green New Deal would necessarily fix.  She's pointing to problems that occur, say, in the South Bronx, this is one of the most socialist cities in the nation, where you have great government control and extremely high taxes, and you still have appalling conditions that people are living in.  With the Flint water crisis, again, this is something that the government did not prevent and did not stop.  So if she thinks that government is the solution, she just gave two examples of the government being the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What do you think, Richard?</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Listen, I think the Green New Deal was a -- is a framework, right?  Like I said, I don't think it's the perfect solution but here lies the problem.  So we saw -- and I'm pretty sure we'll show the clip later of Utah Senator Mike Lee showing all these pictures of -- I think Ronald Reagan sitting on top of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's take a look at this because that was Senator Mike Lee yesterday and it went viral.  His posters which slammed the Green New Deal.  Here is one example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH:  I rise today to consider the Green New Deal with the seriousness it deserves.  This is a picture of Aquaman, a superhero from the undersea kingdom of Atlantis.  I draw your attention, Mr. President, to the 20-foot impressive seahorse he's riding.  Under the Green New Deal, this is probably Hawaii's best bet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is pretty funny.</p><p>FOWLER:  It is funny and I'm pretty sure the Kinkos stocks should be going through the roof right now because he made a lot of -- he spent a lot in printing.  But here is the truth is that both the United Nations, the Congressional report, the fact is that climate change is a real thing, right?  And I think what we have on one side is the Green New Deal, I'm not saying it's the best solution but on the other side you have folks likes Senator Mike Lee saying that climate change, nothing to see here, nothing is happening and I think that is part of the problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch McConnell didn't know.  Mitch McConnell actually is now on the record as saying I'm talking about climate change.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER:  They haven't given any solutions and I think the solution exist sometimes in the middle when Democrats, Republican, businesses come together and say, OK, we have a problem here and that's actually trying to figure out some real solutions because the real problems like Super Storm Sandy flooding.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a nice thing to say that this is just a framework but it actually -- it is legislation that she would like to bring to the -- that she would like to see materialize, so it's not just a framework.</p><p>JON STEINBERG, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, CHEDDAR:  But to your point, Maria, it's basically nonexistent on facts right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>STEINBERG:  No one actually knows what's in the Green New Deal, the world is ending in 10 years, apparently it's causing asthma in New York City.  But what we've seen here is the politicians level of marketing skill has completely evolve.  I think largely as a result of President Trump, we have people now that know how to message, know how to use gimmicks, you've got presentations skills from somebody like AOC that are spectacular.</p><p>The way she presents, the way she speaks and we're entering sort of an area where this is what's going to define, you know, the movements that happened in this country.  This socialism thing is unbelievably dangerous whether it's the Green New Deal or the pied-a-terre tax or the -- under the real estate kill tax basically in New York City.  This kind of stuff is going to make things happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Green New Deal proposes explicitly retrofitting every house in America.  This is the Wall Street Journal's editorial today.  And eliminating fossil fuels within a decade.  That is higher energy cost, it will hurt lower-income Americans more than anyone else and our standard of living as a nation will suffer and they have to answer to that.  Instead all of these yesterday, Democratic presidential candidates voted present.  The Journal is calling it profiles and present which is hilarious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's -- that's the thing, I mean, you could say, yes, climate change is an issue, she could have just said that but to come up with this whole plan that is specific in terms of getting rid of fossil fuels in the next 10 years doesn't make any sense and that's why they're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER:  Yes.  I mean, I think the -- but the truth of the matter here is that her plan sits on one side and on the opposite side of the aisle there is nothing, there is no plan, there is zero, there is an empty box, right?  And I think if you look at -- if you look at recent polls you will see millennials in the Republican side are saying climate change is real and their party doesn't have an answer to that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the answer will be is that a carbon-free future is one -- is it creates a nation that you don't want to live in.</p><p>FOWLER:  But that's not coming from the President or the party.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you -- and also well, they -- we talk about it endlessly on this program and it is private industry that has not only lowered our emissions --</p><p>STEINBERG:  Absolutely, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- with the use of natural gas, it is private industry and getting out of the way of using and developing and discovering in a new way those very fossil fuels that are plentiful in this country that keep people's energy costs down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there is a plan and Corporate America has been executing that plant --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  Look at the electric car move, you know, we can -- you know, we all, you know, punch at Elon Musk for his craziness all day long.  He's done more to affect, you know, hybrid and electric vehicles in this country than any amount of legislation, any amount of tax credits.  He just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I forgot throw punches at Elon Musk although I think he's been a jerk in the past, I think that this is -- he ultimately by creating a cool car, he will get more people behind the wheel of the electric vehicle without AOC and her cronies telling us what kind of car to buy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  I tried to do solar, you can't get it done on your house.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you can't get it done on your car because the sun is now always shining.  We'll take a quick break.  When we come back.  The Federal Reserve is in focus.  President Trump's expected nominee Stephen Moore reportedly in favor of the Central Bank cutting rates at this point.  We're going to get into that.  And then time for a change.  Colorado's governor unveiling a new state logo.  But it's his look that's gone viral.  We'll be right back with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning.  The Las Vegas review Journal says that giving Nevada a raise, minimum wage of $12 is possible by 2024.  Proposed legislation raising minimum that wage to $12 an hour for workers not offered health insurance, $11 for those who are.  The increase would be gradual, 75 cents a year beginning in 2020.  Did you know Empire reporting an Alaska moose hunter can rev up his hovercraft according to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>Justices reeling at the National Park Service was wrong to ban John Sturgeon from using his hovercraft on a river running through a national preserve.  The panel decided the agency does not have the jurisdiction over that stretch of land.  The Denver post this morning writing, Governor Jarid Polis unveils new Colorado logo with a tree and a sea from the state flag.  He says the new look better reflects Colorado and will not cause taxpayers any more money.</p><p>The Governor wearing a winter hat featuring the colorful logo during his presentation and that hack up plenty of comments on social media.  Colorado's new logo.</p><p>FOWLER:  I like it.</p><p>STEINBERG:  He was my classmate at Princeton.  He was my classmate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that right?</p><p>STEINBERG:  Yes.  He was always doing like start-ups and all sort of stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's awesome.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Colorado is the coolest -- one of the coolest states in the country.  I lived there for a couple of years and it's -- I think it -- the people in Colorado are also the thinnest in the nation because they're so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  I want to ask you about the moose thing, OK?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEINBERG:  -- because you know -- because you've mentioned some of the outdoor stuff to me before in the green room.  Like isn't hunting a moose in a hovercraft won't actually the moose off?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is he hunting it?</p><p>STEINBERG:  He was hunting moose in the hovercraft, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that he was hunting, no.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Oh, he was just chasing those.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No. I think it was stretch of water.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a stretch of water.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It went through -- I don't know, I have to go read the story but I don't -- yes.  But it depends on how loud his hovercraft is.  I like how you turn to me from moose.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The moose story.</p><p>STEINBERG:  I will -- I will - you can keep both of those.  I'll stay right here in New York.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's my line of the day, don't hunt these majestic animals.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>STIREWALT:  I'm -- I concur.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, look, you know what I want to talk about with you later on in the show, this idea about socialism and you said it was dangerous some of these plans.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think it's so dangerous because people don't understand these are Federal programs and socialist program.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Because I think you have an entire generation of young people that don't know that socialism is breadlines basically that are having it sold by them and not another generation, not a counter kind of marketing message of how great capitalism.  I mean, Ken Langone's book, you know, I love capitalism, it was great, we need an AOC version of capitalism basically in terms of pitch.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back.  The technology battle.  Apple is facing iPhone sales bans in the United States after Qualcomm's patent ruling.  And then a special delivery.  UPS beats out Amazon and FedEx to roll out successful revenue generating drone deliveries.  We'll show you more when we come back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, March 27th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures are indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning.  Take a look, the Dow Industrials Futures down 50 points right now, a quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P 500 down 3 points, and the NASDAQ lower by 1 and three quarters, stock finished positive yesterday.</p><p>The Dow added nearly 141 points on the session.  It was one-half of a percent higher at the close.  The S&amp;P was up 20 points, three quarters of a percent, as well as the NASDAQ, 53 points higher yesterday, at the close.</p><p>Global markets this morning, under some selling pressure, European Indices are down across the board, as you can see, FT-100 down 23, CAC Quarante down 20, and the DAX Index down 28.</p><p>Shares were mixed in Asia overnight, Japan was down two-tenths of a percent, as you see there, a quarter of a percent, but the biggest mover was China, Shanghai Composite up almost one percent.</p><p>In favor of cutting interest rates, Stephen Moore, President Trump's pick for the Federal Reserve board, reportedly says that rates should be cut immediately by half of a percentage point.</p><p>May's tough decision, meanwhile, British lawmakers are looking for a new strategy this morning, for the country to exit the E.U., with Prime Minister Theresa May facing pressure, now to step down.</p><p>Special delivery now, by drone, UPS beats out Amazon and FedEx with drone deliveries of medical supplies, we'll show you how it works.</p><p>And then, smart glasses, Huawei unveils glasses that are all about sound, yes, Huawei, coming out with those glasses.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, right now, Apple and Qualcomm's legal back and forth, a U.S. trade judge, ruling that the technology giant violated a Qualcomm patent in the manufacturing of certain older model iPhones and recommended an import ban on some iPhones.</p><p>At the same time, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor of Apple and invalidated a Qualcomm patent on battery-saving technology.  The two companies have been in a two-year long legal battle.  Qualcomm says that Apple owes billions of dollars in loyalties over technology used, in their iPhones.</p><p>Joining us now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director, Daniel Ives, Dan, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.  First, give us your reaction to this Qualcomm-Apple fight which keeps going on?</p><p>DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Yes, it's just another round in this 12-round heavyweight battle, I mean, there's (INAUDIBLE) Qualcomm feels like they have Apple against the ropes, in terms of some of the rulings they've gotten especially overseas.</p><p>You know, I think this was a bit of a gut punch to Qualcomm in terms of -- on the ITC ruling.  And I think, right now, this continues to be overhang on Apple because they continue to come out at the wrong time, given iPhone sales a phone off a cliff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We want to talk more about regulation and the potential of it.  Europe is obviously ahead of the U.S.  The E.U. continues to take on big tech, the European Union, backing copyright reforms targeting Facebook and Google.  They would require the companies to pay licensing fee to publishers for content posted on their platforms.</p><p>These new reforms also targeted copyrighted material by installing filters on the platforms, but, Dan, this is all on top of what we know to be hefty fines against Google, against other tech companies in Europe, much more aggressive in Europe than the U.S., will the U.S. follow suit at some point, do you think, and get a bigger government hand on tech?</p><p>IVES:  This is another anti-big tech measure.  I could tell you I talked to executives last night, a bunch from the valley, and these are nightmare who are ruling because from a copyright perspective, it's more lawyer-driven right around Brussels, but really anti-big tech.</p><p>We continue to think from GDPR to moves like the copyright, Europe continues to be much further ahead, regulatory wise, from the U.S., but look, with Warren and some others talking about breaking up big U.S. tech, that's something that investors are getting a little more worried about especially since we go into next election cycle.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Dan, let's go back to Apple for a second.  Investors have been talking about it nonstop since the media announcements this past week.  It seems to me that Qualcomm is not the overhang, is that ultimately, it was a whole home event, a lot of celebrities, very light on details.</p><p>And ultimately, if you look at five-day chart on the stock, the service's revenue is supposed to be to solve for the flattening of device sales, but people seem to think it's not going to happen now, agree or disagree on that?</p><p>IVES:  Oh, definitely, the battleground areas and services, we continue to look, 400, 450 billion of the valuation of services.  And when I look at the announcement this week, I viewed it as a step in the right direction, ultimately they are keeping the play book close to vest.</p><p>There's a lot of competition of Netflix and Disney, but otherwise, we continue to do see Apple does make a large content acquisition, that's going to be significant not just from a distribution platform but from original content.  That's the key right now for Cook and Cupertino with their back against the wall.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, it's Dagen McDowell, and I put out this crock pot theory, I think it was yesterday, that if investors become concerned about the growing competition from Apple and other content providers, that drives down Netflix stock.</p><p>That makes Netflix attractive potentially to Apple, sweeping them and buying them.  Do you think Apple ultimately tries to buy Netflix?</p><p>IVES:  Look, we have said the biggest strategic mistake that Apple and Cook have ever made, was not acquiring Netflix.  I think it's becoming clearer and clearer, it's around services and content.  That's why we believe that's still potential on the table.</p><p>But we view as CBS, Viacom, and A24 Lionsgate, as more likely in terms of the content acquisitions for Apple, even though they've never done historic M&amp;A.  Right now, we believe the clock struck 12:00.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, yes, I mean, you know, content is king right now.  Look at the billions being paid for original content.  What about the privacy issues around at Facebook?  I mean, this morning, the company is announcing it is cracking down on fake news, announcing it has removed more than 2,600 pages that are linked to fake accounts, the majority were tied to Russia and Iran.</p><p>But look, when you talk about fixes for the company's privacy issues, what does that mean?  I mean, this is their business model, right?  I mean, they sell data to advertisers, so can you really get out of what the issues are, without completely changing the business model?</p><p>IVES:  Well, look, and that's why Cox and the other executives have been revolving door and leaving, because as you play nice in the sand box to the bell weight in Brussels, you ruin your business model.  And I think that's the worry right here, is that, as you get more to privacy, it comes down to that's the worry for investors, that's why there's been the overhang here.</p><p>And I think there -- it's a fork in the road situation, they're going to have to kind of balance this because ultimately, especially when you look at what happened in Instagram and the messaging platform, that's going to be the key for Facebook, that's why in fang names, right now, you know, some queer overhangs, especially on the social media names, with Facebook front and center and a target on its back.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Dan, I mean, I think -- to add on to Maria's questions, so, I mean, how does Facebook deal with that, right?  The fact that they have to police the site, they have to get all these sort of fake accounts off the site.</p><p>They have to get these people buying fake sites off the site.  And at the same time, they have to make money off of ads.  I mean, how do they balance those two for the marketplace?</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  We believe it's content-driven and fundamentally, Facebook right now, they're going to have to draw more and more content on the platform, focus more and more on user engagement.  They're going to have to do these privacy issues, but it gets back to that is their core business model from an advertising perspective, that's what investors care about.</p><p>And that's also why even internally, at Facebook, that's what they care about.  And that's why Zuckerberg right now, there's a battle going on internally, where they have to continue to stick to their core knitting, otherwise, even there could be, you know, some nightmares days ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was just going to say, oh, so they are media companies, but they can't be sued for defamation under federal law?</p><p>And again, I brought this up, Devin Nunes' lawsuit against Twitter, it's pushing the legal boundaries of what is going on, because mid-'90s law, you cannot sue internet service providers and other companies because they don't technically create the content and aren't media companies, but they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but they are.</p><p>STEINBERG:  On Dan's last point, they don't want to stick to their knitting anymore.  Zuckerberg has come out and said now it's all going to be about private messaging.  This is his big of a shift, as post IPO, when they had to make the pivot to mobile.  And now, you're going to have to bet on a whole new company.  They're exiting this public arena.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not a whole new company, though, they are reckless with people's private information and I think that that's what investors know, and I think that's what the public knows, is you're saying it's private, but you can still see all of these messages and all of these communication.</p><p>And what are Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg going to actually do with that, do we trust them?  Somebody told me, doing business with them, like you cannot trust what they tell you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you mentioned Dan -- and you mentioned Devin Nunes and his lawsuit against Twitter, more are coming, I understand (INAUDIBLE) as well as the Daily Beast, he's going to be suing others, and he'll be joining us this week, by the way, to talk about it.  Dan Ives, it's good to see you this morning, thank you.</p><p>IVES:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll keep watching.  Meanwhile, a date has been set for Elon Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission to square off in court.  Lauren Simonetti on that story in headlines this morning, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We have the date, Maria, Elon Musk's contempt of court case, set for April 4th.  A federal judge in New York, hearing arguments on the SEC's claim the tweet, Musk, posted in February, violated terms of his fraud settlement, because Musk didn't get approval from Tesla.</p><p>UPS is making history today.  The company is testing drone deliveries of medical supplies to a hospital in North Carolina.  The flight marks the first commercial drone deliveries approved by FAA.  Drones will transport lab samples from hospitals to doctors' offices and so forth, getting them to their destinations much quicker than ground deliveries, essentially from 30 minutes to 3 minutes.</p><p>Huawei is teaming up with Gentle Monster, that's a Korean fashion brand.  They are set to release their first smart glasses.  You're looking at them.  If you buy a pair, you'll be able to listen to music and take phone calls simply by tapping the temple of the glasses, so you won't have to wear ear buds.</p><p>The glasses can be charged wirelessly, they go on sale in July.  We don't know how much they are going to cost.  Glasses -- smart glasses have struggled from other companies, we'll see if this one will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it spying on all your data and what comes up there, I mean, Huawei has its own issues, we know that, and the U.S. government is trying to ban Huawei telecom and technology from the U.S.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And if you're wearing something, is it, you know, spying on all the people around you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  What is it doing with that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll have to look at that.  Coming up, thank you, Lauren, eye on China trade, top U.S. officials back at the table this week, another round of talks with China, what can get done, we're going to get into it when we come back, and then tough decisions in the U.K. this morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May faces increasing pressure to step down, lawmakers there, looking for another strategy to exit the European Union, all ahead right here, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching negotiations between the U.S. and China.  Big week.  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing this morning ahead of high-level talks tomorrows.  Joining us right now to talk about what it means for markets and investing Tiger 21 Chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt.  It is good to see you this morning, Michael.</p><p>MICHAEL SONNENFELDT, CHAIRMAN, TIGER 21:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  What are your members doing in terms of allocating capital, how important is a China deal to them in terms of putting money to work in markets?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Well, first of all, our members have been shying away from China for all of the problems, rule of law being one of them but as far as the negotiations when our members think about their businesses, they've been getting stolen intellectual property.  It's hard to develop a product when fake product is in China within 24 hours.  So, on the intellectual property, that's got to have some progress and then you have tariffs and quotas, and we want to tamp it down because we know bad things happen when that gets out of control.  So, members who are running small businesses, they know that these are the two factors that they're looking at.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, we want to talk China this morning, we also going to talk rates.  Dagen, look at this 10-year yield which has happened in the last half an hour.  The yield has dropped below 2.4 percent, this is a big move here, down four basis points, what do you make of it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think some of this is a reaction to the comments of Steve Moore, who is the nominee to be on Federal Reserve Board by president.  Yes, to President Trump.  I almost said Obama.  President Trump trading in fed fund futures indicates a 70 percent -- 75 percent probability for a rate cut by the end of the year based on Steve Moore is saying that the Fed should cut rates.  So, this is very often when you see the yield curve invert where shorter term rates are higher.  This is telling you that the Fed will be cutting rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is this a positive or a negative?  I mean, look, rates being lowered is a good thing usually but if it's indicating things are a lot slower than anybody thought, do investors react negatively to that story?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Look, for my member's point of view, I was in a meeting yesterday where people are trying to make sense of this.  Most recessions are indicated by an inverted yield curves, not all inverted yield curves mean we have recession.  But it's a warning signal, it's one of those red flags.  So, clearly people are concerned about the Fed, but generally, the Fed has been high marks when you think about the changes at the Fed over the last year.  I think people are pleasantly surprised.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Michael, that's my question to you, which is usually, the inverted yield curve means a recession but we've never seen this level of whipsawing in interest rates and kind of reversal that's being messaged now.  Can we say the economy is fundamentally strong, that the removal of any chance of impeachment removes kind of the, the domestic overhang that could rattle the market and then ultimately, this is just a readjustment with the new Fed chairman?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  So, for business people, not economists trying to run small businesses, that is what our members are about.  They balance what you just said with the trillion-dollar deficit.  We've never had a trillion-dollar deficit.  So, it's like when you're pulling a rope.  Now, we have one in one direction and one in the other and nobody knows which part of that is going to win.  You can have the kind of trillion-dollar deficit even though the signals are pretty good right now.  The members in our group were saying it's kind of like being on thin ice: we're still skating, but it feels like the ice is getting thinner and thinner.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Michael, the question around this China trade thing that Maria brought up at the top of this segment, right, so I think the two issues you brought up both tariffs as well as intellectual property, seemed to be sticking point for China, right?  Because what China wants is immediate relief of the tariffs, but they don't really want to give up intellectual property which is why this negotiation have sort of hung on for so long.  So, how does the folks in your group see this, right, and what is the best outcome for them?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  I would say of all of the policy areas that are going on, the one where our members, which are businessmen, left, right, conservative, liberal, the ones that they concentrate on is the intellectual property.  If we don't break the back of this kind of activity, every time you invest, I have a company in Germany that we create little computers in the solar business.  Within 24 hours of a new product, a fake product is on the web in China.  You can't afford to make investments if every time you make an investment, it's stolen.  So, this is an absolute bedrock issue for any kind of basic business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I think the Trump administration knows that, but the question is: are they going to be able to put in some kind of an enforcement mechanism where they could just, you know, snap back tariffs or do something should China not follow through on its promises to stop stealing.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Well, certainly, our negotiator, Lighthizer, is one of the tough negotiators.  You got to give the administration credit for putting somebody in who has a spine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, we'll leave it there.  Michael, it's great to see you.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Michael Sonnenfeldt there.  Coming up, the search for more options: British Prime Minister Theresa May told to set a date for her departure as lawmakers consider alternative plans to leave the E.U.  That's next.  Back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  British lawmakers are voting on other option this is morning for the country's exit from the E.U.  Prime Minister Theresa May is now facing pressure to step down.  Ashley Webster with all the details right now.  Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hey, Maria, listen, she's been under pressure for a long time, Theresa May.  She will step down.  It's a matter of whether she can get her deal across the line, which she has not been able to do.  In fact, humiliating defeats twice now.  And if she can get it across the line, she will resign at that point too.  So, her future, we know, is outside of number 10 Downing Street.  The bigger issue, though, is how the heck they're going to break this deadlock in parliament.  They're going to be voting on 16 different options being proposed today, house speaker -- House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, the guy that shouts order, order.  He'll decide which ones will be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You sound like him.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Thank you very much.  He will decide which ones will be debated, he'll probably whittle it down to half a dozen.  But let's point this out, none of what happens today, the debate and the votes mean anything.  They are non-binding and Theresa May can completely ignore what they do today; it's just parliament saying, we've told you what we want to vote for but now, today, we're going to show you what we will vote for.  If there's a massive majority in parliament for one particular option that will put a lot of political pressure on Theresa May and she may be impossible for her to ignore.  But bottom line here is, you know, this is crunch time and she still doesn't have enough votes for her plans.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Ashley, will her deal get a third vote?  So, I mean, the speaker has already ruled that her deal wouldn't get up their vote like a couple -- a week or two ago.  Will her deal get a third vote now?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, it will because the E.U. has now put stipulations on it.  So, you could argue it's now in the different form.  There are reports that maybe a third time will happen this Friday symbolically because it's March 29th, the day that the U.K. was supposed to leave the E.U.  If not, sometime next week.  But by the way, these votes taking place today, these indicative votes will get whittled down and we could see another round of this next Monday, April Fool's Day, make of that what you will.  Bottom line is, this is going to be -- there's still a no-deal option on the table as far as Johnson said today.</p><p>STEINBERG:  Ashley, that's my question to you.  So, when I can't get over something, and I'm not doing something, my dad says: John, move on, move on, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>STEINBERG:  It's over.  They're Brexiting, move on.  Why can they not just get --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Because Theresa May's greatest quality is her persistence.  Her biggest problem is her persistence and her stubbornness.  She's kind of said, it's my way, these are my red lines, nothing changes.  Parliament has said, that's not good enough and that's where we're at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Wow, what a story.  Ashley, thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll take a break.  When we come back, coffee with the side of playtime.  We'll take you to unique coffee where you can cuddle with corgi.  Next hour right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, March 27th.  Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.

Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, in his Capitol Hill office. Zuckerberg left the hourlong meeting - one of several with lawmakers on Capitol Hill - without answering questions from a throng of reporters and photographers pursuing him down a hallway.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawley, though, had plenty to say. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" he told reporters. \"I will believe Facebook when I see some real action out of Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than moving users' personal data from properties such as WhatsApp and Instagram to the core Facebook platform, the company should put a wall around the messaging services or, better yet, sell them off, Hawley said he told Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who requested the meeting, \"did not think that was a great idea,\" he said.</p><p>A Facebook spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>The popular messaging services are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving the company what critics say is massive market power that has allowed it to snuff out competition.</p><p>Zuckerberg's discussion with Hawley touched on industry competition, data privacy legislation, election security and accusations by conservatives that Facebook and other social media giants are biased against right-leaning content.</p><p>During his visit, Zuckerberg also met with other senators including Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also declined to answer reporters' questions when he left Lee's office earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>Lee's office said the two discussed bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, regulation of online services, enforcement of antitrust laws in the tech industry and data privacy issues.</p><p>Congress has been debating a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p>Acting preemptively, Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content, and ensure election integrity and data portability. The internet \"needs new rules,\" he said.</p><p>It was Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.</p><p>The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.</p><p>At Facebook's request, Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington on Wednesday night for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.</p><p>Warner told The Associated Press that he wanted Zuckerberg to hear his Senate colleagues' \"enormous concerns about privacy and about protecting the integrity of our political system.\"</p><p>Their message for the Facebook chief was \"self-regulation is not going to be the answer,\" Warner said. \"I think Zuckerberg understood that.\"</p><p>Warner and Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting from them and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.</p><p>The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-3871288</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3B-R4C1-JDH1-C0XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Red Deer Advocate</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, in his Capitol Hill office. Zuckerberg left the hourlong meeting - one of several with lawmakers on Capitol Hill - without answering questions from a throng of reporters and photographers pursuing him down a hallway.</p><p>Hawley, though, had plenty to say. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" he told reporters. \"I will believe Facebook when I see some real action out of Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than moving users' personal data from properties such as WhatsApp and Instagram to the core Facebook platform, the company should put a wall around the services or, better yet, sell them off, Hawley said he told Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who requested the meeting, \"did not think that was a great idea,\" he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg \"had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,\" a Facebook spokesman said. On Facebook and Twitter, Trump posted a photo with the caption, \"Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook in the Oval Office today.\"</p><p>No details were given on the meeting, first reported by the Axios website.</p><p>Trump has persistently criticized social media companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and his platform of choice, Twitter, embracing conservative critics' accusations that they censor religious, anti-abortion and politically conservative views. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on Hawley's remarks concerning his meeting with Zuckerberg.</p><p>The popular services WhatsApp and Instagram are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has allowed it to snuff out competition.</p><p>Zuckerberg's discussion with Hawley touched on industry competition, data privacy legislation, election security and accusations by conservatives that Facebook and other social media giants are biased against right-leaning content.</p><p>During his visit, Zuckerberg also met with other senators including Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mike Lee, R-Utah, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, and John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark. He also declined to answer reporters' questions when he left Lee's office earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>Lee's office said the two discussed bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, regulation of online services, enforcement of antitrust laws in the tech industry and data privacy issues.</p><p>Congress has been debating a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p>Acting preemptively, Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content and ensure election integrity and data portability. The internet \"needs new rules,\" he said.</p><p>It was Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.</p><p>The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.</p><p>At Facebook's request, Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington on Wednesday night for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.</p><p>Warner told The Associated Press he wanted Zuckerberg to hear his Senate colleagues' \"enormous concerns about privacy and about protecting the integrity of our political system.\"</p><p>Their message for the Facebook chief was \"self-regulation is not going to be the answer,\" Warner said. \"I think Zuckerberg understood that.\"</p><p>Warner and Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.</p><p>The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-e02c186734de4a469bec830b05bd3968</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X38-PT71-JC65-54BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><timeReceived>00:24 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;
