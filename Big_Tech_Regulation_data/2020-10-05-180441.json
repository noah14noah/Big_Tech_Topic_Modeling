But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. </p><p>What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours.

Because it was tempting, of course, this was personified perhaps by Bill Gates more than anybody else, tempting to see this sort of geeky, extraordinarily smart business leader in a new enterprise, tech-oriented, who really was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge. But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. </p><p>I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data.

The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours.

There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data.

I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours. In the United States, there is a law which in essence says that the tech companies can't be held legally responsible for online</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YN-977370b5425e40edbd3afef06e263b01</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X44-8C41-DY08-3355-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402030</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" </p><p>I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours. In the United States, there is a law which in essence says that the tech companies can't be held legally responsible for online content that is on their platforms. Is it your contention that law must now change? Actually, yes. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. It was created in the 1990s when the internet was really just taking off. The notion was that the best way to enable the internet to take off was to give to interactive services immunity that journalists, networks, television and radio had traditionally faced for content. I don't think that one should just abrogate what was created</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SE-c5a73ea50f114de3874079cc8c257586</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X44-8C41-DY08-339R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours.

I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours. In the United States, there is a law which in essence says that the tech companies can't be held legally responsible for online content that is on their platforms. Is it your contention that law must now change? Actually, yes. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. </p><p>What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours.

But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. </p><p>What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need additional guardrails. We need to guardrails that will be essential for the decade ahead, the 2020s, and we need to start building those now. Let's get specific, and let's start with privacy and data. Goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and our laptops and our tablets to acquire and use information, and thereby to also provide information about ourselves to tech companies such as yours. In the United States, there is a law which in essence says that the tech companies can't be held legally responsible for online content that is on their platforms. Is it your contention that law must now change? Actually, yes. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. It was created in the 1990s when the internet was really</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-afa9b35e6738473fbe8de6139a6d8db9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X44-8C41-DY08-335Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that technology is having on jobs and the future of the economy. And in some places in the world there are some guardrails in place, say, in Europe, around something like privacy. But almost everywhere you look, I think we need</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-d60dd9ee3c164202af841567832e0a8f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3X-9651-DY08-306G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"415\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Nvidia said the deal, worth $40 billion, will create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence. And finally, is there life on...Venus? Scientists have discovered what they say could be potential signs of life floating in the clouds of the planet. </p><p>A new scientific paper reveals the discovery of gas called phosphine, typically associated with living organisms. The future really is in the cloud. This isn't fog, it's smoke. California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton, and I am the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I have landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco only different. Mandatory masks everywhere, the airport almost completely empty. The streets quieter, much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech though. Many of the stories based on theme that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations, after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub, to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it is something that Click will be doing more on. It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks But he did send its new iteration of products around healthcare. -- But it did centre its new iteration of products around healthcare. Including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-4ea29b8fd5f6410a953f820a8980f8ca</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WB-2381-JBH6-C1KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. </p><p>You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland. And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple times. And then, the second thing we do is, we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So we have taken the tiles that everyone is used to in videoconferences, separated them out and dropped them into a 3D games' engine. You can wave to all to the other members of the audience just before you Zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of the Tempest. And what we discovered with that is that it's really exciting, when it really comes to life, is when the audience is live and can be seen live too. It is performers and audience live, and you have moments where you can see each other. And a lot of our shows pre-lockdown were inside-specific locations, moving around, giving the audiences, small groups, little challenges to do. It is as much live film or live gaming, and I think what the pandemic has created is this sort of opportunity put real people into a digital world. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about, it's about physically being with other people. It's about being shoulder to shoulder with somebody. It's about having laugh, the freedom to cry. You know, theatre is fundamentally a shared experience. I mean, the phrase we keep hearing is \"the theatre industry has been decimated\" - that's you know what? It's right. It's calculated that theatre is worth #1.28 billion in annual ticket revenue. The UK's government has now allowed indoor performances with social distancing to start again. But to make money, theatres often rely on packed houses, which aren't possible with social distancing regulations. A handful of theatres in the West End are planning to reopen soon. And some venues, like this one in South London, have started performances with reduced audience capacities. This has still left thousands of people working within the theatre industry out of work. Can the technology we use to conduct video meetings really help this struggling sector? So, our director's in Northern Ireland, we have a performer in Ireland, we ahve our other performers scattered all over the country. Everyone is at home, so they have green screens up. We've had to very rapidly kind of learn the best rehearsal processes to have for that. Theatre folk are fond of saying \"the show must go on\" but with so much technology involved, getting through a performance glitch-free can't be easy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-ac3f0130971647e5ace974bb049bc872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WB-6MH1-DY08-319B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. </p><p>It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to on its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base it was easier to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who get discovered is what draws people to TikTok. It's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels, but I think companies are seeing TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @BBCClick. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you soon. Hello there. Monday was another day of impressive cloudscapes across the UK, but big lumpy clouds like these tend to produce intense downpours and thunderstorms, and that is exactly what we saw. This is the radar picture. It shows that those showers and storms look quite extensive across England and Wales. Some of them were heavy enough to give some localised flooding but equally a few spots fell between the showers and stayed completely dry. And Tuesday is going to be a similar sort of day. Some slightly more persistent rain though across North Wales and northern England for a time, and generally quite a cloudy start across the north of the UK. For Scotland, the skies should brighten. We'll see some sunshine, but a scattering of heavy showers into the afternoon. These could give some localised flooding.

It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base it was easier to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who get discovered is what draws people to TikTok. It's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels, but I think companies are seeing TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @BBCClick. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you soon. Hello there. Monday was another day of impressive cloudscapes across the UK, but big lumpy clouds like these tend to produce intense downpours and thunderstorms, and that is exactly what we saw. This is the radar picture. It shows that those showers and storms look quite extensive across England and Wales. Some of them were heavy enough to give some localised flooding but equally a few spots fell between the showers and stayed completely dry. And Tuesday is going to be a similar sort of day. Some slightly more persistent rain though across North Wales and northern England for a time, and generally quite a cloudy start across the north of the UK. For Scotland, the skies should brighten. We'll see some sunshine, but a scattering of heavy showers into the afternoon. These could give some localised flooding.

The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to on its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo.

I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. </p><p>It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to on its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base it was easier to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who get discovered is what draws people to TikTok. It's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels, but I think companies are seeing TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @BBCClick. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you soon. Hello there. Monday was another day of impressive cloudscapes across the UK, but big lumpy clouds like these tend to produce intense downpours and thunderstorms, and that is exactly what we saw. This is the radar picture. It shows that those showers and storms look quite extensive across England and Wales. Some of them were heavy enough to give some localised flooding but equally a few spots fell between the showers and stayed completely dry. And Tuesday is going to be a similar sort of day. Some slightly more persistent rain though across North Wales and northern England for a time, and generally quite a cloudy start across the north of the UK. For Scotland, the skies should brighten. We'll see some sunshine, but a scattering of heavy showers into the afternoon. These could give some localised flooding.

I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. </p><p>It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to on its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base it was easier to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who get discovered is what draws people to TikTok. It's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels, but I think companies are seeing TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @BBCClick. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you soon. Hello there. Monday was another day of impressive cloudscapes across the UK, but big lumpy clouds like these tend to produce intense downpours and thunderstorms, and that is exactly what we saw. This is the radar picture. It shows that those showers and storms look quite extensive across England and Wales. Some of them were heavy enough to give some localised flooding but equally a few spots fell between the showers and stayed completely dry. And Tuesday is going to be a similar sort of day. Some slightly more persistent rain though across North Wales and northern England for a time, and generally quite a cloudy start across the north of the UK. For Scotland, the skies should brighten.

I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. </p><p>It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to on its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base it was easier to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who get discovered is what draws people to TikTok. It's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels, but I think companies are seeing TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @BBCClick. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you soon. Hello there. Monday was another day of impressive cloudscapes across the UK, but big lumpy clouds like these tend to produce intense downpours and thunderstorms, and that is exactly what we saw. This is the radar picture. It shows that those showers and storms look quite extensive across England and Wales. Some of them were heavy enough to give some localised flooding but equally a few spots fell between the showers and stayed completely dry. And Tuesday is going to be a similar sort of day. Some slightly more persistent rain though across North Wales and northern England for a time, and generally quite a cloudy start across the north of the UK. For Scotland, the skies should brighten. We'll see some sunshine, but a scattering of heavy showers into the afternoon. These could give some localised flooding. Not quite as many showers further south at this stage, through the Midlands, Wales, East Anglia,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-630959e4befb47dd8043c1b3484ec745</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M8-VFC1-JBH6-C1X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. </p><p>But, is the convenience with the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to on its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base it was easier to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who get discovered is what draws people to TikTok. It's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels, but I think companies are seeing TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @BBCClick. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you soon. Hello there.

Monday was another day of impressive cloudscapes across the UK, but big lumpy clouds like these tend to produce intense downpours and thunderstorms, and that is exactly what we saw. This is the radar picture. It shows that those showers and storms look quite extensive across England and Wales. Some of them were heavy enough to give some localised flooding but equally a few spots fell between the showers and stayed completely dry. And Tuesday is going to be a similar sort of day. Some slightly more persistent rain though across North Wales and northern England for a time, and generally quite a cloudy start across the north of the UK. For Scotland, the skies should brighten.

I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. </p><p>It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to on its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base it was easier to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who get discovered is what draws people to TikTok. It's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels, but I think companies are seeing TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @BBCClick. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you soon. Hello there. Monday was another day of impressive cloudscapes across the UK, but big lumpy clouds like these tend to produce intense downpours and thunderstorms, and that is exactly what we saw. This is the radar picture. It shows that those showers and storms look quite extensive across England and Wales. Some of them were heavy enough to give some localised flooding but equally a few spots fell between the showers and stayed completely dry. And Tuesday is going to be a similar sort of day. Some slightly more persistent rain though across North Wales and northern England for a time, and generally quite a cloudy start across the north of the UK. For Scotland, the skies should brighten.

It may look as if people across Europe are enjoying the sunshine but for many, soaring temperatures are taking their toll and they are set to get hired to do the heat experience across much of Europe is down to a weather system over the Atlantic. It is created atmospheric treasure over the region, drawn up hot air from northern Africa and Spain. This means high temperatures. </p><p>Previous record temperatures of 38.5 degrees in Germany and 41.5 in France looks set to be beaten this week. In Paris, a Level three extreme heat plan has been activated. Level four, the maximum, has never been used. As part of the plan, 900 cool places have been set up including putting up temporary fountains and Mr Machine stated parks are being kept open at night for people to cool down in. 800,000 schoolchildren have had their exams postponed because of concerns about people's health. Comparisons are being drawn to the heat wave France experienced in August 2003. Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible. It looks as if many people have heeded his advice dig there has been a rush at this store that sells fans and air conditioning units. And people will need plenty of this stuff. Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-c80e4617f3764e6591d38404878e99cb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-3981-JBH6-C444-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

This means high temperatures. </p><p>Previous record temperatures of 38.5 degrees in Germany and 41.5 in France looks set to be beaten this week. In Paris, a Level three extreme heat plan has been activated. Level four, the maximum, has never been used. As part of the plan, 900 cool places have been set up including putting up temporary fountains and Mr Machine stated parks are being kept open at night for people to cool down in. 800,000 schoolchildren have had their exams postponed because of concerns about people's health. Comparisons are being drawn to the heat wave France experienced in August 2003. Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible.

Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-94343c2d321d418cba31596d742a8159</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-3981-JBH6-C43G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

In Paris, a Level three extreme heat plan has been activated. Level four, the maximum, has never been used. As part of the plan, 900 cool places have been set up including putting up temporary fountains and Mr Machine stated parks are being kept open at night for people to cool down in. </p><p>800,000 schoolchildren have had their exams postponed because of concerns about people's health. Comparisons are being drawn to the heat wave France experienced in August 2003. Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible. It looks as if many people have heeded his advice dig there has been a rush at this store that sells fans and air conditioning units. And people will need plenty of this stuff. Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-7f2b62ff17104d8f8f7e018d3ea2a2a5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-3981-JBH6-C48M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

As part of the plan, 900 cool places have been set up including putting up temporary fountains and Mr Machine stated parks are being kept open at night for people to cool down in. 800,000 schoolchildren have had their exams postponed because of concerns about people's health. Comparisons are being drawn to the heat wave France experienced in August 2003. Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible. It looks as if many people have heeded his advice dig there has been a rush at this store that sells fans and air conditioning units. And people will need plenty of this stuff. Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WM-36a4921b5a024fa89c58122aa4ee005f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-3981-JBH6-C43P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402028</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

In Paris, a Level three extreme heat plan has been activated. Level four, the maximum, has never been used. As part of the plan, 900 cool places have been set up including putting up temporary fountains and Mr Machine stated parks are being kept open at night for people to cool down in. </p><p>800,000 schoolchildren have had their exams postponed because of concerns about people's health. Comparisons are being drawn to the heat wave France experienced in August 2003. Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible. It looks as if many people have heeded his advice dig there has been a rush at this store that sells fans and air conditioning units. And people will need plenty of this stuff. Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The Eastern Black Rhino was wiped out in Rwanda, but thanks to a successful conservation and breeding programme in zoos across Europe, five rhinos have now been reintroduced into the country. But, the ongoing threat of poaching for rhino horn means they'll need special protection. Victoria Gill followed them on their journey. Not your usual feeding time. He loves apples. This is rhino flight training. Don't get afraid, OK? With comforting words and lots of apples, the keepers here at this Czech zoo are training rhinos to stand calmly in a confined space. It's something they'll need to do for hours on their upcoming flight to Rwanda. Five young rhinos, all born in European zoos, have been selected to be transported and released into the wild. They're all the descendants</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SW-2979778bba1e4c1bbf4c998ed10be8eb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-3981-JBH6-C48J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.
