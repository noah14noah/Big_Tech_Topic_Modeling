Friday marked the beginning of a new phase of Brexit but not its end.  The British government is said to still need to negotiate the terms of its future relations with the EU, a task so complex that many doubt it can be completed by the end of the year, when another deadline would loom. In the meantime, the country will be bound by the bloc's laws and regulations. Trade deals with other countries remain to be hammered out. And at home, the fallout of Brexit division will linger-and potentially reshape British politics for years to come. Fear is, it would deepen the political divisions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pessimists predict economic catastrophe for manufacturing and agriculture. Optimists, on the other hand, believe it is all well, ahead. According to Pippa Norris (Brexit Is Just the Beginning-published in Foreign Affairs on Jan. 31, 2020)the rights and access to social benefits of the 2.7 million EU citizens who have applied to stay in the United Kingdom remain unclear.</p><p>'Perhaps an Australian- and Canadian-style points system for immigrants is likely to be adopted. But so far, nothing has appeared in black and white in this regard. Prime Minister Johnson's office has expressed its determination to leave the EU's customs union and single market, and to use that freedom to strike new trade deals, including with the United States. At the same time, the government hopes to maintain easy access to markets across the channel through a 'zero tariff, zero quota' free trade deal with the EU, according to Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay.' Brussels is said to have no interest in a hyper-deregulated competitor that would undercut EU prices and standards on matters such as workers' rights, environmental protection, and food safety.</p><p>If PM Johnson fails to negotiate a mutually satisfactory deal with the EU by the end of the year, tariffs would be slapped on British goods and services, supply chains would be disrupted, and long drawn red tape would make trade with EU come to a standstill. Indeed, it already has; according to Bloomberg Economics, the price tag stands at around $170 billion today and will balloon to roughly $260 billion by the end of 2020-more than the United Kingdom's total payments to the EU budget over its 47 years of membership. For what it's worth, the United Kingdom has signed trade deals with a handful of countries, including Lebanon, Tunisia, and Liechtenstein-but these are said unlikely to compensate for the loss of unrestricted access to markets of 450 million people across the channel. </p><p>After the winning the elections, PM Johnson had acknowledged that many pro-exit Labor voters had 'lent' him their vote based on his pledge to 'get Brexit done,' with some constituencies changing hands for the first time in a generation. The government has promised more public spending in northern England, especially on hospitals, higher education, and railways. But such investments are said to take many years, even decades, to bear visible fruit, and in the meantime many cities in the north face spending gaps. Deep divisions between cosmopolitan liberals and social conservatives are expected to persist, with the former embracing globalization, multiculturalism, and openness to social change, and the latter retreating into nationalism, xenophobia, and resentment about the loss of traditional values. </p><p>Leaving the EU is said to have increased pressures for another Scottish independence referendum. Faced with London's diminished role in the world, the foreign office is expected to seek to bolster transatlantic ties, as always, but with unpredictable results, given the record of U.S. President Donald Trump's questionable loyalty and his love of tariffs. A costly and traumatic divorce may, it is feared, just be the beginning of the United Kingdom's troubles.</p><p>London's Evening Standard in a comment on January 31, 2020 (Brexit is done. Now we need to find a new role in the world) said, after half a century of membership, appeals in the 2016 referendum to a common European identity fell on millions of deaf ears; and after three years of economic stagnation since, and transparent evidence that the promises of Brexit were false, the voters reaffirmed their decision in a second vote in the election last month. So the truth must be faced by all who wanted Britain to remain in the EU. 'Britain walks through the exit door with a feeling of melancholic resignation rather than excitement about the future. The nation knows it has chosen the poorer path - the estimates produced by the Bank of England yesterday show an economy barely growing, with a trend rate not seen since the Seventies. The country also knows it has greatly diminished its voice in the world - already our views on everything from climate goals to the taxation of big tech matter far less.</p><p>'The more thoughtful leaders of the Brexit campaign know too that they prevailed by harnessing a nativist opposition to change and a resentment at the success of others in parts of the country, outside the cities of the North and South, that felt left behind. They talk of levelling up, but they won on the argument of levelling down: if you can't enjoy the fruits of globalization, then nor should anyone else. No one beyond the offices of a few deluded hedge funds in Mayfair believes Brexit was a vote for less red tape and more free trade.</p><p>'The party that now represents Sedgefield and Blyth Valley champions more government intervention, higher spending and extra regulation. Yesterday, the Conservatives were trumpeting their re-nationalization of the Northern railways, the kind of state involvement in the economy that we joined the EU to get away from. 'Global Britain' may be the slogan, but neither the globe nor Britain believe a word of it.'</p><p>Indeed, there's a trade agreement to be negotiated - and the details matter a lot to businesses - but it's a much less important decision than the existential one that Britain has just taken about whether it is a member of the EU. Arguments are expected to crop up about 'divergence' - but the truth is that, in most areas, global standard-setting and the European markets will force Britain to be a taker of the rules it had until Friday participated in making. That's why the hard Brexit on paper is expected to feel much softer in practice. It will take time, it is said, for this loss of control to become apparent - but when it does, the same questions that faced Britain 50 years ago will confront Britain now: how does Britain exert its influence in the world? How does Britain sustain support for the free markets and the open society?</p><p>US Secretary of State Dean Acheson famously said of the post-war Britain that it had lost an empire but not yet found a role. Back in 1972, Britain thought it had by joining the European community. In 2020, as Britain leaves, it's time to come together - because Britain still has not found what it is looking for.</p><p>Like most enduring parties, the Tories are said to have embraced many different factions and ideologies over the years. But in the post-World War II era, they were seen to be defined by an advocacy of free markets and traditional values - a combination that was brought to its climax in the person of Margaret Thatcher, the Tories' most effective prime minister since Winston Churchill. Those who voted in favor of leaving EU are said to be suspicious of foreigners and resentful of the new, cosmopolitan Britain that they see in London and the country's other big cities. They are said to want less immigration and multiculturalism. And they are seen to be more rural, more traditional, older and whiter and want some kind of a return to the Britain in which they grew up.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PAKOBR-PAKOBS0302202000059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PAKOBR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y49-KYH1-JCH9-G2V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">384243</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Hurmat Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pakistan Observer</publicationName><volume>Vol. 31</volume><issueNumber>No. 34</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Pakistan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001739</classCode><className>TRADE TREATIES &amp;

Will that really happen? Maybe, though not straight away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EU citizens' data cannot legally be sent to \"third countries\" which lack our level of data protection. One way to keep the data flowing is if foreign states apply for an \"adequacy finding\" from the EU, which tests if the receiving country's data protection laws are up to scratch.</p><p>It takes months and involves the European Commission and a process of \"comitology\", which is just as painful as it sounds. It also needs deep legislative and regulatory groundwork to be laid by the applicant, something the UK does not currently excel at. Also, it cannot even begin until after the UK leaves the EU. By contrast, Japan is just about to secure an adequacy finding as part of its long-prepared EU trade deal.</p><p>You might think that as the UK has just enacted its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law, it would easily pass the adequacy test. Unfortunately, the 2018 Data Protection Act is no guarantee of success. It is stuffed to the gills with carve-outs, including one that says the UK government won't fully protect the data of non-UK citizens in the country. Hardly the stuff to endear it to the EU Commission officials needed to kick the adequacy process off. (To guess how a government might like to treat citizens tomorrow, it's always revealing to see how it treats immigrants today.) The other way to transfer EU citizens' data to third countries is for each organisation to put standard contractual clauses agreeing to uphold EU rules into customer contracts. The EU Data Protection Supervisor's office prefers this approach over adequacy, as it makes companies work on compliance. The UK's official advice, published on September 13, is for UK organisations to adopt model clauses.</p><p>After Brexit, the big tech firms whose business models are built on international data transfers will do just fine. They already have the operational systems and in-house lawyers to make it work.</p><p>A conservative estimate is that it costs a UK company about \u00a310,000 ((EURO)11,000) to apply its own EU-acceptable contract clauses.</p><p>If you are an Irish company that sells, say, custom T-shirts to people in Northern Ireland, then you may experience what the UK government euphemistically calls \"turbulence\".</p><p>There is a third way, the 'data harbour' created for US firms to self-accredit as compliant. Max Schrems challenged this regime with an Irish case that went to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). He won. Why? The Snowden revelations showed that US firms freely share our data with their government and we, as customers, have no redress.</p><p>The UK is unlikely to be offered a data harbour arrangement, both because the whole idea is in crisis, post-Schrems, and because of the UK's insufficient surveillance oversight.</p><p>Which brings us to the contradiction at the heart of data-Brexit. While the UK remains a member of the EU and under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the EU must grudgingly accept Britain's unusually high level of state surveillance. But when that (fairly homeopathic) oversight goes away, the same practices become illegal, because EU citizens have no redress. That means Irish data transfers into Britain - and onward to the NSA in Maryland - must legally stop.</p><p>One of Theresa May's career goals is to bring the UK out of the European Court of Justice. Now she is within sight of achieving this, the cost to business of Britain's surveillance state, May's other great passion, is clear. The UK can \"take back control\" or it can maintain the data-transfers the digital economy depends on.

That is, they\u2019re both water towns and popular tourist destinations. The stark difference lies where Wuzhen serves as the hub of everything internet and the bastion of internet connectivity in China, Nzeluzu on the other hand remains devoid of everything internet.</p><p>From big data, internet plus, smart manufacturing and everything internet, small businesses, and most developing countries have been left out of the global digital economy. The need to bridge this digital divide has come at a time when it is needed most- to salvage and decentralize the hugely monopolized global trade and economy.</p><p>Although for example most countries in Africa are at the bottom of the race to reach full connectivity and the new frontier in the global digital economy, internet access is now available in capital cities of all countries on the continent, and the impact of new information technologies is gradually spreading to other urban areas. What impedes the growth of the internet in developing countries \u2013 for example, if connectivity is to reach a town like Nzulezu \u2013 includes high illiteracy, poor telecommunications infrastructure, shortages of trained personnel, and reluctance by governments to allow development of independent service providers.</p><p>The theme for this year\u2019s World Internet Conference \"Innovation-driven Internet development for the benefit of all- building a community of common future in cyberspace\" encapsulates not just the vision of mankind\u2019s quest to integrate economically through cyberspace but also the problems that impedes that quest- which is the current standing world economic order where multinationals from developed nations bully small businesses and developing countries from share of global trade.</p><p>Policies geared towards breaking these barriers should take center stage, as envisioned by <person><nameText>Jack Ma, </nameText></person>the founder of e-commence giant Alibaba, who has proposed the building of a new global e-commerce platform dubbed the Electronic World Trade Platform, or e-WTP, a move that would undoubtedly change the way the world does business. As Ma envisioned at the BOAO Forum for Asia in March this year, the establishment of the e-WTP could break down existing trade barriers and enable small and medium enterprises, young people and developing countries, which have been largely left out of the world's free trade regime to share equitably profits from global trade.</p><p>Making the e-WTP possible, fair and equitable boils down to the question of who controls the internet. The controversy over who should control the internet had lingered on for many years until March this year when a deal was brokered between the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) founded in 1998, to end direct US government oversight control of administering the internet and commit permanently to a multilateral treaty with stakeholders from governments and oversight by the UN.</p><p>According to analysts, this move has set the center stage for further penetration of the internet, with global governance body Internet Assigned Names Authority (IANA), the part of ICANN that deals with country codes, internet numbers and protocols ceding its oversight control to the UN. A liberalized internet has come at a time when entrepreneurs worldwide are seeking to own a simple website store, connect with other businesses around the world and make a decent income.</p><p>It is based on the idea of creating decent income streams for entrepreneurs as big tech players such as Alibaba, Facebook, Microsoft and others build logistics and ecosystems that could reach even the most obscure locations around the globe. Facebook for instance is taking free wireless connectivity to Africa to make internet accessible to deprived communities. Several tech giants from China are also making inroads into Africa, South East Asia and other underdeveloped nations.</p><p>In building a community of common future in cyberspace, governments in most developing countries arguably cannot foot the bill alone, which why innovation and internet driven development from global tech companies are welcome everywhere.</p><p>Observes will also be watching how civil liberties are protected across the globe. That if the right to internet is a human right, how would governments around the world provide access and protection of this right. Participants at the forums will also be faced with the daunting task of improving regulations geared towards ensuring cyber security, Nonetheless, I believe the conference as it has always been, will showcase incredible new innovations and improvements in technology during the three-day expo. My concern however is how these new innovations and technology could become readily accessible to my brothers in Nzulezu.</p><p>Development and transfer of technology however has always followed a trickle-down effect - that is why I would like to see the upcoming conference in Wuzhen be a game-changer and stay true to the theme in all aspect with regards to decentralizing the global digital economy and therefore changing global business in its entirety.</p><p>The author is a Ghanaian Journalist.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/38/147934158164.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/38/147934158164.jpg</url></p><p>0023ae606e661996675701.jpg<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDLY-81738832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDLY2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M64-MP21-JDJN-6512-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411370</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 China Daily Information.

The firm will take over the ownership interest of Bruce Deifik and his family once it receives interim authority to own a casino. Until it gets that approval, which could come within three to four months, a trust will be created for the casino's temporary ownership. Once Luxor Capital completes a promised $70 million investment into the property, atrustee will be appointed to oversee the trust. The casino-hotel plans to operate normally during the transition. Ocean Resort was one of two formerly shuttered casinos that reopened the same day last June, along with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hard Rock</emphasis>. The reopenings brought Atlantic City's casino total to nine, shortly after five casinos had shut down in a market that could not support them all. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Atlantic Club</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Showboat</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Revel</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump Plaza</emphasis> all closed in 2014, and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump Taj Mahal</emphasis> closed in 2016.

The latest stakeholder to come out swinging: the pension insurer for the U.S. government. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.</emphasis> over the weekend came out against Lampert's proposed $5.2 billion bid for the foundering retailer. In papers filed Saturday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the PBGC pointed to a $1.7 billion funding gap that it said Lampert's bid doesn't account for. Plus, bankruptcy experts say Sears could become the latest example among retailers and other companies that, once thrown into bankruptcy, see their pension plans wiped cleaned.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Washington Post</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elsewhere</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Big food is grilled</emphasis></p><p>Big Food is portrayed as the new Big Tobacco in a sweeping report that links the industry's influence to a global obesity epidemic, along with malnutrition and climate change. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lancet Commission on Obesity</emphasis> blamed a growth-focused sector for a system that gorges populations on empty calories while misusing land, energy and other resources. Without naming companies, the medical journal report released late Sunday called for restricting the industry - led by multinationals such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nestle SA</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McDonald's Corp.</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Coca-Cola Co.</emphasis> - from policy-related discussions. The beverage industry remains committed to the United Nations' call to improve public health with such measures as offering lower- and no-calorie drinks, smaller packaging, and responsible marketing, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">International Council of Beverages Associations</emphasis> said by email.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Bloomberg News</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The shutdown's cost</emphasis></p><p>The longest-ever government shutdown cost the federal government $11 billion in lost economic activity, although about $8 billion in that will be made up in additional economic activity as back pay goes out to federal workers, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congressional Budget Office</emphasis> said Monday. The shutdown is projected to lower America's gross domestic product by $3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as by $8 billion for the first quarter in 2019, the CBO said. But the economy will grow about $8 billion faster in the next two quarters than it would have without the shutdown, muting the shutdown's long-run impact. The impact of the shutdown is small - just 0.2 percent of GDP for the first quarter of 2019. But, CBO notes, that masks \"significant effects on individual businesses and workers.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Washington Post</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">British firms cut jobs</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tesco Plc</emphasis> will cut as many as 9,000 jobs as the U.K.'s biggest retailer steps up its response to discounters, the rise of online shopping, and the threat of a powerful new rival. The supermarket firm said it may redeploy as many as half of the affected workers as it closes some fresh-food counters that cost-conscious consumers have been spurning. The grocer joins other firms across the U.K. that are cutting thousands of jobs as uncertainty over Brexit feeds concerns in executive suites and households. Carmaker <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jaguar Land Rover</emphasis> said this month that the U.K. would be part of its 4,500 job-cut program, while <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vauxhall</emphasis> motors said it plans to trim 241 jobs at a plant in Ellesmere Port, England.

data Cambridge Analytica being the real primaries of of people's data allegedly being taken from Facebookand used to influence their thinking these serious issues and the MPs are trying to understand what is Facebook's response to be to these issues been I think the best he got was that they are sorry think quite rightly Facebookare saying sorry about this but the question is what's the plan for the future can you reassure politicians that is going to be something that needs to be done by them or done to them in terms of regulation and that will improve the situation and why hasn't it since the Cambridge Analytica and tobacco everything came out it does seem really that much has changed I'm wrong there I can understand you saying that because we seem to have scandal seems to be an issue and it all seems to go away but <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has been from us politicians he's now been in front of European politicians I think the tectonic plates around data privacy are moving and all the big tech organisations are looking seriously at right where will this go and I think this is something very serious in the minds of both the public as well as politicians who want to be reassured and we New regulation the General data protection regulation talking about coming to the end of this week I think that's another serious step change in terms of how people will be protected and their personal data protected OK cover I know you're back shortly to talk to the paper including something on that story as well Kulveer Ranger Thank you very much now let's move on and talk about Ireland because historic referendum takes place on Friday on whether to reform Ireland's abortion laws the vote will decide whether to repeal a constitutional amendment that effectively bans terminations it will be the country's 6th referendum on the issue currently abortion is only allowed when a woman's life is at risk the McGovern reports now from government she said she now has a brain-stem so its heart is beating now flat and but it's it's not pointless and I started to think about this they need and what it might be like for this they need to be for and I could imagine it being very pleasant way to the point and I sell or so I started to think because public was a penalty we work and continue to believe in Ireland abortions are committed only when the mother's life is in danger same he was given a choice she could be looked after in Ireland until her baby died or medical paperwork could be sent to Liverpool and Amy and her husband Conor could follow that paperwork to the UK for a termination Amy's story is just one in the debate about abortion but there are so many stories on both sides of the issue is highly emotive and sensitive topic that's dividing the people of Ireland the campaign is in full swing as it has been from months leading the no campaign is caught Sherlock on the 25th of may with the talking about something that would end the life of a baby for any reason 12 weeks so I don't believe that their areas and others difficult situation in life in society we advocate ending the life of a human being in order to bring about a positive response the event was designed to protect a child and it works it is not only ignored but then denying the result of beating and to run as a failed experiment is extremely for events to someone like me who are likely human rights have been a team of the no campaign but in a country like Ireland many are asking whether their campaign is linked to the history of religion and Catholicism since the Foundation of the state there has been silence think of anything to do with sexuality women's bodies for two missing and over the last almost 100 years women have been put into institutions women who are pregnant outside marriage and mother and baby homes and was all about marginalising and keeping secret what was considered a shame I wonder if May 25th whatever the outcome that might become a catalyst for the people of this country to talk openly to friend and neighbour and debate what sort of future Ireland they want to live here McGovern BBC News Dublin do stay with us here on the briefing because also coming up in the programme how heavy is all water in the world well these satellites on day 10 of the Takeaway in Norway with a few

alignment he has the table apparently freedom of movement he table the possibility of a second referendum what is coming over to confirm anything but the PM might agree says will take some time to unwind on this and then obviously the meantime both these party leaders have their backbenchers up in arms indeed and and as we've already mentioned time is not on their side by any means whatsoever the next Wednesday is that special summit in Brussels where Theresa may has to go with a plan some sort of plan Yeah what are you thinking in terms of whether we can pull this off Yeah I remember speaking to months ago maybe even before the Christmas break and I said at the time it felt like a big game of chicken and we got a clock ticking it works in favour of some people in addition for certain things it terrifies think the rest of us when it does look like a plan coming together and for those who are terrified women within the business community themselves Use of very concerned about the Selvey if if not just about the logistics of misleading on the 12th of April or even if it were on the 23rd of may 22nd May should I say I think of the things that the business community from what I can tell is not concerned about is no deal Brexit but then ridiculous behind that they are worried about is just continuing to drag on for months and months more we need a little bit more decisiveness we need to be able to afford the process Let's look at some of these other stories now what do you make of what the international monetary fund is saying now this is a warning about the market power a small group of global companies and they are the companies we would expect GoogleAmazon and AppleFacebook I'm saying is really concerned about how much dominance they have and what it does to innovation and and small tech start-ups to just can't get a look-in Yeah I think it's interesting what they must do because I think it would have been conspicuous they haven't said anything about the influence of the few British companies at the same time they actually didn't name check any specific companies Yes of course we all know which ones are talking about they were also trying to be quite a ransom I think they said that the rising market apparently vision has so far been positive so they are trying to sort of curb their say but absolute this saying they continue to rise in dominance had nearly reached there's going to be issues and we are seeing unintended consequences already right and so you already have issues about privacy about data usage but their point is this could also affect central banks if you start to see a recessive sort of behaviour in economic markets and how much power therefore these platforms control just explain how it would if impact decisions made by central banks what these big companies doing that that in itself sounds quite it is the usual doesn't it seem like a bit of a stretch is the only reason I can see where it was directly connected might he said an advertising spend and how much money actually goes into these platforms not directly from consumers of course to benefit from using these services are free from advertisers and the company's whether there's a nefarious forces For you now or just plain News website the other opportunites as a result was the reach these people haven't I guess I'm saying if the central bank wants to calm the nerves Kong jitters about raising rates low rates and if these platforms are a vehicle for amplifying certain point of view perhaps makes it more difficult for them to control the narrative also President Trump has talked about how powerful some of these companies are he had worried about that and he mentioned Amazon some would argue he has another reason to go after Jeff Bezos Amazon there's there's a lot of other issues going on there but I just wonder if we'll ever get to the point where competition authorities will actually look at companies like Amazon just think Yeah they are just too big break the company's up for sure I mean I think the EU is already looking not too different ways you've seen penalties and fines imposed on Google I'm sure this will continue to be more and more scrutiny on the tech companies as they continue to get greater and greater reach and go into new markets as well new sectors them let us talk about Prince Harry joined the social media is more addictive than alcohol and drugs timing is everything shortly after launching an Instagram account is exactly there's this guy here millions of followers it is I would imagine I'm 9 saves from my personal experience I have 3 children and they're coming into 13 years now and this is huge for them Instagram and various other apps that their role and it is extremely addictive and we were just talking about the impact that the big tech companies could have how does it manifest itself absolutely and young people this is where they're getting their influences Easton BBC television used to be movies but I think that was probably less in your face It's a constant Perry and have about gaming whether it was a fortnight but otherwise he said I felt like theirs in he's always talked openly about mental health and wellness so there's a place I think I had drunk 9 but it is quite ironic they do and therefore just large their official Instagram page they are the most number of followers overnight than any other account ever and so you kind of winners he also feeding into it as well he will be out soon</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

President Joe Biden the second is the obstructed Congress but trying to stop officials giving evidence and withholding documents there are almost no rules for a trial like this and Democrats and Republicans are completely at odds over whether to call witnesses It's all that all means this trial could last anything from two to 6 weeks Democrats want to hear from the former national security adviser John Bolton who reportedly likened the pressure being put on Ukraine to a drug deal but Republicans are threatening to retaliate by insisting Joe Biden on his son appeared to in the coming

of undertakings prescribed by the constitution box for a fair trial with witnesses president continues to dismiss his impeachment as a hoax instead focusing on his achievements here at the farmer's rally in Texas and what I'd get out of it tell me I get impeached that's when I get out by these radical left lunatics get impeached but that's OK the farmers are sticking with Trump They could two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict the president and remove him from office that is extremely unlikely Nevertheless these coming weeks I will resonate the years to come Gary O'Donoghue BBC

City's Cynthia Nixon running for governor so reduce screen stars have more power in politics now in the US it asks that question and then the final story in the China Daily if you love cats this one's for you why the craze for cats there is putting cash in the country's Kitty apparently I promise James will be back he's here James Hughes chief market analyst at currency trader who says he doesn't like cats tall but don't bet against it said Let's have a look at the financial times first front page of course got the bird they got the Brexit deal got all these stories they are dominating Facebook though shares hit extremely hard and no surprise really and now of course the story is is probably got a lot of legs to go isn't as a lot can happen before we really see the end of this and probably a lot of big swings in Facebook's share price it will happen before we hear the end of this but I think what's interesting what this story really focuses on is is that almost the landslide we saw when when this News came out and of see we have this so called Frank So Facebook Amazon Netflix and Google or out the back as there as they know m these these companies they good thing so strong for such a long time very little in the way a bad press coming out around them and toughening that has hovered over yet of course this would have been performing so well what we see here is we know that data and our personal data is always quite quite a sticking point for any social media companies whatever there is anything that says that that has been even compromised or used outside of what is supposed to be used for there is always a downside to the share price an issue as well of course for Facebook and Google for example enough fan group as it were and Twitter others is if the decisions made they should be regulated they should be policed in some way what impact will have her on the likes of Facebook also many are asking the question about to what extent they want to be using these platforms tall yet if their data is is being misused farmed out sent out elsewhere without their knowledge of their prior knowledge of course Facebook denied any wrongdoing as is the other companies involved in this but interesting to see how <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>reacts to this what he decides to do in terms of talking to politicians on both sides the Atlantic that kind of thing Yeah I think there has to be full co-operation That's Facebook said it is going to happen it would be for co-operation going forward but was any sort of enhanced regulation on social media would be it would be a huge downfall of course when you see that the knock-on effect this has it all of these big tech stocks will be following these stories any story that is really because he's because it has a knock-on effect on the likes of Apple and Netflix all of these companies really get hit with his any News around these big big tech now let's talk about Uber is that San Francisco Chronicle looking in detail at what happened what actually happens this self driving taxi on the road testing conditions that feel the real road and a woman was knocked down And is tragically she died this says no fault by Uber but this is the problem with this technology isn't it is hard it is very difficult to predict human behaviour absolutely and the argument behind this would be it would would say look there is this computer code that we're looking at these algorithms it these aren't the reactions of a driver this is how computer will react even in the face of of a situation like this now is it imports South that the police and and of the fisheries around this said that Uber was not at fault when it counted the car was not for the driver there was not apps for this would have happened in the age we live in this we would need just stepped out and between TUV hair or human driving car the exact same situation would have happened so the authorities say so I don't think it's necessarily the end of the road for this this kind of technology this is seen as the future fir fir car travel especially when its boot but it's eights all of these stories are very different when the name Booba is mentioned in it because there is such a bad press surrender Yeah so that all obviously Tesla back by Lon Musk is is is testing all this stuff has opted to indeed enter people's perception of them is completely opposite you as you say Google as well as doing this other big technology names are all looking at this this innovation as it were what you think you feel safer with the thought of a driverless car self-driving cars on the road or not Wallace at it like you the viewers have been saying that of course that a driverless car can't drink can't take drugs can't use a mobile phone when he retired can't be overtired work exactly but then again you have that old tech is very easy for</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

they get people outside but some argue they just cause many accidents when I was joined earlier by Oliver Cornock editor-in-chief of Oxford Group which began with the Brexit deadlock this impasse seems to be even more difficult to navigate for the Prime Minister than we might imagine Woods's anybody thought this will be an easy process has been proved sadly very very wrong and what's going on of course is that there is an existential split for Theresa may in the she promised to resign am when she gets a deal for Britain However those people who are more likely to go for the soft deal that she is proposing a proponent of are very concerned about who comes next which was the Telegraph's story is really difficult to see how is helps similarly the opposition a equally concerned whoever comes next more like to be more hardline it really does come to this sort of extremes we are hearing about we saw that last week in Parliament square as well the demonstrators very rapidly falling to sort of rather ugly extremes this is not going to get any pretty Sally but the clock is ticking which is proving to be a cliche right now is it we say all the time because we got to the 12th of April actually the European council called for a special meeting on on the 10th of April I believe in which say they want to discuss what next proposal is from the UK so we have got to come up with something price that in theory all we leave on 12 April without a deal and today's a process in parliament an indicative vote is non-binding indicative votes might come up we've we've with some sort of indication as to what parliament one might feel able to back that is highly thought to be customs union that is really very unpopular with Theresa may in the Conservative party's a bedrock indeed the vast majority of people in the industry I think really feel that as well It's a very hard one to see and to see how this is going to gain support and again it is not a guarantee that the government would would support whatever of Parliament came back with that was it that it's coming down to this tough Between parliament and and government Let's look at the Daily Telegraph and that's the Guardian in its discussion there talking about the Tories need experience at the helm is quoting Chris Grayling as head of the department transport saying May's successor must be a Brexiteer who can hand over to the next generation as a Cabinet split emerges this you might think retaining a very popular and is making a little less popular and let's not forget Sally it was only a couple of years ago that may was was seen as the steady rather to see us through the sale and the Telegraph but rather short memory because they were the people championing his experience and she was home Secretary did been there for a very long time very steady I think what this does show is that nobody really knows their apparent I know you might think he actively NAO warn those what would Garner enough support that is a very general election there's also this whole question of you know what might happen then in terms of who could lead the Conservative party to a successful majority if there were to be a general election even I was not an exact I think what was interesting yesterday watching the the MP's doing it that the studios was that actually there was not much appetite for a general election even from the opposition because they are all so split on this because it is not a party political issue is much much deeper than that deal have a sense of what might happen is so difficult to predict right now isn't it what what the outcome of all this is gonna look like no I don't I don't think anybody does and as we were when we started we were talking in the business section it actually investors and business people are really want some sort of certainty centres pretty low the we heard from from the other interview as damaging calculable the damage being done to the image of Britain abroad UK Inc Yes we should watch this space Let's now move on to the front page of the financial times Zuckerberg's mea culpa on regulation fails to check the back Against big tech this is the boss of Facebook calling for more regulation of internet companies even talking about perhaps other countries following that guided the European Union with the introduction of GDP are rules that new regulations were introduced last year just rape regulator a great degree how data is used within Europe what do you make of what he had to say what I one level you can be quite sceptical about it sorted closing the stable door after the horse has bolted you think of the problems that have with Cambridge Analytica the the uproar of people realising their data is being marketed used mind I am

interesting again a lot of investors seven-year high the moment I see that continues the meantime let's move away from the middle East and the markets and talk about tech because the EU proposing new rules digital service law but there is some resistance not surprisingly some big tech companies the reason this story will probably run and run for years and the EU's digital services act the new rules would probably be prepared for that at the time been back companies and legally liable third the illegal content and this is the lobbying group and it's like Google etc at what actually if you do that if you make us personally liable and this could be some executives will be pressing libel that actually you create a disincentive for us to be proactive to uncover some of the illegal content so they are still arguing for self-regulation they say Yes we do need of course to have some accountability but not necessarily personal accountability at but it's quite clear that these arguments could run them they have been Yeah and years every year to discuss this Cicely Meanwhile the debate rages on and the arguments rage about more regulation but one imagines the lobbyist are extremely powerful on as well they have a lot of money behind them safe and that position Yes they will be powerful so where do you think this will grow into it venture The do you think is sorting out of this in the immediate future always going to be something that drags on and the and big tech companies just have to grow in their power and strength they are able to resist even more well I I would hope I think with consumers would hope that there will be some degree of compromise and clearly some really good contact somebody hate stuff some of the and child sexual content has has shocked everybody I think everybody knows that there needs to be some degree of regulation but is very difficult to imagine that can be done quickly Yeah and case might come on let's talk about the story and this is more coming out of Las Vegas CES expect and the unveiling launch of this pork made a while this plant based pork substitute and about whether leading alternative meat producers called impossible foods the really hoping to take a big portion of that poor market really here on Monday and and pork is that most widely consumed meet in the world it is indeed inaction within China with its enormous the huge consumer demand for pork and man was that was hit over the course of last year by nice wifey which ended with huge gem her of of of pigs in China but this more than that I mean this is to do with climate change this is to do with demographic change animals increasingly in the spotlight for creating a lot of CO2 emissions and said the cost of feeding an animal and environmentally will be a lot cheaper and more efficient for stick to grow the crops and use that to feed humans rather than didn't think it through the annual lifecycle as well so at this is a story which reaches the go away I recently saw a company in Israel that work 3D printing stakes out of plan based content it said this is something which is really expanding but the interesting part of impossible foods is that they are not just going to be doing sausages which and beyond meat are already doing but threats against the As into the meat and mince and substitute prop basin which could be more widely incorporated and the fact the fact that burger King heart launching the impossible sausage I think next week the US 67 of their roster and restaurants shows that I imagine if it catches on something around a massive global chain then that will be a test case and clearly that there is certainly a demand really with demographic change with with me and populations say Africa and Asia are bound to grow we know it can grow very significantly the cost of meat will be rising significantly which means that for many of us there will be no choice really a apartment to use plot substitutes and you try any of these I haven't and this is because I don't like me so little and number one had yet it is interesting I think once a move towards more plant-based out there I think I have to try and give some of these products ago much of my kids will be into power I will have to see won't we do lovely to have you with us Thank you for taking us through the papers Thank you very much for being with us as well you can reach me on Twitter I'm at Samantha ITV News stay with us much more to come We'll have more coverage of that funeral of general Soleimani

happen before we really see the end of this and probably a lot of big swings in Facebook's share price it will happen before we hear the end of this but I think what's interesting what this story really focuses on is ease the almost the landslide we saw when when this News came out and obscene we have these so called Fang Stocks Facebook Amazon Netflix and Google alphabet as there as there are no empty these these companies they could be so strong for such a long time very little in the way a bad press coming out around them and often hover over yet and this would have been performing so well what we see here is we know that data and our personal data is always quite quite a sticking point for any social media companies whatever there is anything that says that that has been even compromised or used outside were supposed to be used for there is always a downside to the share price an issue as well of course for Facebook and Google for example enough angry as it were and Twitter another as is if the decisions made they should be regulated they should be policed in some way what impact will have a handful of the likes of Facebook or also many are asking the question about to what extent they want to be using these platforms tall yet if their data is is being misused or farmed out sent out elsewhere without their knowledge their prior knowledge of course Facebook denied Doing is the other companies involved in this but interesting to see how <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>reacts to this what he decides to do in terms of talking to politicians on both sides the Atlantic that kind of thing Yeah I think there has to be full corporation was that Facebook said it is going to happen it would be full co-operation going forward but was any sort of enhanced regulation on social media would be it would be a huge downfall of course when you see that the knock-on effect this has it all of these big tech stocks will be following these stories and story that is really closely because it has a knock-on effect on the likes of Apple and Netflix all of these companies really get hit with his any News around these big big tech now let's talk about Uber is that some brisker chronic call looking in detail at what happened what actually happened the self driving taxi on the road testing conditions but actually on the real road and a woman was knocked down and it ends tragically she died this says no fault by Uber but this is the problem with this technology isn't it is hard to is very difficult to predict human behaviour absolutely and the argument behind this would be it would would say look there is this computer code that we're looking at these algorithms it these aren't the reactions of a driver this is how a computer will react in in the face of of the situation like this now is it imports South but that the police and and of the vision around this said that Uber was not at fault when it counted the car was not for the driver there was not apps for this would have happened in the ocean liner this this would have just stepped out and between two vehicles have all human driving car the exact same situation would have happened so the authorities say so I don't think it's necessarily the end of the road for this this kind of technology this is seen as the future fur third car travel especially that is when it is booed by its eggs all these stories are very When the 9 who is mentioned in it because there is such a bad press surrender Yeah so that all obviously Tesla back by Lon Musk is is is testing all this stuff as well opted to indeed enter people's perception of them is complete it is about as you say Google as well as doing this other big technology names are all looking at this this innovation as it were what you think you feel safer with the thought of a driverless car the self driving cars on the road or not at it like you the viewers have been saying it is of course that a driver's car can't drink can't take drugs can't use a mobile phone when he retired can't be overtired it shouldn't work exactly but then again you have that's all techies us for Let's move on Let's we've got to break the chains of you love is love talking Brexit City a.m. has on its front page breakthrough other papers have it too and and you know the difference of opinion as to what degree is a breakthrough not but would you argue that this decision on the part of Shell Barnier David Davis to agree a transition deal ie what happens after March 2019 Yeah for that initial period is good News for companies and businesses in terms of their planning Yes and no this is Firstly breakthrough easier a breakthrough really or is this just some of the bits that we already knew that they were common ground on they've officially said Yes we have common ground in these situations</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Stocks cut losses throughout the afternoon, leaving the benchmark index down 0.4% for the session -- comparable to the losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%), and Russell 2000 (-0.4%).</p><p>The negative-sounding headline conflicted with the optimistic tone struck by top White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Ross just last night. Also transpiring last night was the U.S. Senate passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, much to the contempt of China. Altogether, it seemed like a good time to take profits, especially if the Dec. 15 tariffs still go into effect.</p><p>The trade-sensitive areas of the market like the S&amp;P 500 materials (-1.2%), industrials (-0.8%), and information technology (-0.7%) sectors led the decline. The communication services sector (-0.8%), which contains many growth-oriented stocks, also underperformed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, though, selling pressure quickly abated amid an opportunistic mindset among investors eagerly awaiting a dip. In addition, the details of the report were not as foreboding as the headline, and knee-jerk selling, suggested. Tucked in the report was a line indicating that some \"China and trade experts\" were still optimistic about a deal in the coming weeks.</p><p>Leading the afternoon comeback was the energy sector (+1.0%), which found reprieve amid a 3% rebound in oil prices ($56.91, +1.70, +3.1%).

Lowe's (LOW 117.83, +4.43, +3.9%) also beat earnings estimates and raised its FY20 EPS guidance.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries continued to benefit from a defensive mindset, which sent yields lower in a curve-flattening trade. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.91.</p><p>Separately, the release of the FOMC Minutes from the October meeting didn't draw much attention, as it was consistent with the prevailing view about monetary policy since that meeting.

Stocks cut losses throughout the afternoon, leaving the benchmark index down 0.4% for the session -- comparable to the losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%), and Russell 2000 (-0.4%).</p><p>The negative-sounding headline conflicted with the optimistic tone struck by top White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Ross just last night. Also transpiring last night was the U.S. Senate passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, much to the contempt of China. Altogether, it seemed like a good time to take profits, especially if the Dec. 15 tariffs still go into effect.</p><p>The trade-sensitive areas of the market like the S&amp;P 500 materials (-1.2%), industrials (-0.8%), and information technology (-0.7%) sectors led the decline. The communication services sector (-0.8%), which contains many growth-oriented stocks, also underperformed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, though, selling pressure quickly abated amid an opportunistic mindset among investors eagerly awaiting a dip. In addition, the details of the report were not as foreboding as the headline, and knee-jerk selling, suggested. Tucked in the report was a line indicating that some \"China and trade experts\" were still optimistic about a deal in the coming weeks.</p><p>Leading the afternoon comeback was the energy sector (+1.0%), which found reprieve amid a 3% rebound in oil prices ($56.91, +1.70, +3.1%).

Lowe's (LOW 117.83, +4.43, +3.9%) also beat earnings estimates and raised its FY20 EPS guidance.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries continued to benefit from a defensive mindset, which sent yields lower in a curve-flattening trade. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.91.</p><p>Separately, the release of the FOMC Minutes from the October meeting didn't draw much attention, as it was consistent with the prevailing view about monetary policy since that meeting. Economic data was limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, which declined 2.2% following a 9.6% increase in the prior week.</p><p>On Thursday, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Philadelphia Fed Index for November, Existing Home Sales for October, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for October.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +28.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +24.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.3% YTDRussell 2000 +18.0% YTD</p><p>16:21</p><p>CASH Meta Financial to sell community bank division to Central Bank; announces new common stock share repurchase program; reits guidance (32.82 -0.38)</p><p>Included in the sale are all of MetaBank's community bank branches located in Iowa and South Dakota, as well as deposits and fixed assets related thereto, representing approximately $270 million of deposits.

Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%.

As a result, the co's Board of Directors determined that the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007, should be restated. The co noted that difficult market conditions that have resulted in a significant deterioration of prices of mortgage-backed collateral, combined with a liquidity position under unprecedented pressure from increased margin calls by its reverse repurchase agreement lenders, a portion of which the co has been unable to meet, have raised substantial doubt about the co's ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the co may not have the ability to hold certain of its purchased ARM assets to recovery and, accordingly, on March 5, 2008, the co concluded that a $427.8 mln charge for impairment on its purchased ARM assets is required as of December 31, 2007, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Based upon a review of credit ratings, delinquency data and other information, the co does not believe these unrealized losses, for the most part, are reflective of credit deterioration.</p><p>12:49</p><p>COWN Cowen Group to acquire Latitude Capital Group (7.12 +0.16)</p><p>Co announces it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of Latitude Capital Group.

Stocks cut losses throughout the afternoon, leaving the benchmark index down 0.4% for the session -- comparable to the losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%), and Russell 2000 (-0.4%).</p><p>The negative-sounding headline conflicted with the optimistic tone struck by top White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Ross just last night. Also transpiring last night was the U.S. Senate passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, much to the contempt of China. Altogether, it seemed like a good time to take profits, especially if the Dec. 15 tariffs still go into effect.</p><p>The trade-sensitive areas of the market like the S&amp;P 500 materials (-1.2%), industrials (-0.8%), and information technology (-0.7%) sectors led the decline. The communication services sector (-0.8%), which contains many growth-oriented stocks, also underperformed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, though, selling pressure quickly abated amid an opportunistic mindset among investors eagerly awaiting a dip. In addition, the details of the report were not as foreboding as the headline, and knee-jerk selling, suggested. Tucked in the report was a line indicating that some \"China and trade experts\" were still optimistic about a deal in the coming weeks.</p><p>Leading the afternoon comeback was the energy sector (+1.0%), which found reprieve amid a 3% rebound in oil prices ($56.91, +1.70, +3.1%).

Lowe's (LOW 117.83, +4.43, +3.9%) also beat earnings estimates and raised its FY20 EPS guidance.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries continued to benefit from a defensive mindset, which sent yields lower in a curve-flattening trade. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.91.</p><p>Separately, the release of the FOMC Minutes from the October meeting didn't draw much attention, as it was consistent with the prevailing view about monetary policy since that meeting.

Stocks cut losses throughout the afternoon, leaving the benchmark index down 0.4% for the session -- comparable to the losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%), and Russell 2000 (-0.4%).</p><p>The negative-sounding headline conflicted with the optimistic tone struck by top White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Ross just last night. Also transpiring last night was the U.S. Senate passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, much to the contempt of China. Altogether, it seemed like a good time to take profits, especially if the Dec. 15 tariffs still go into effect.</p><p>The trade-sensitive areas of the market like the S&amp;P 500 materials (-1.2%), industrials (-0.8%), and information technology (-0.7%) sectors led the decline. The communication services sector (-0.8%), which contains many growth-oriented stocks, also underperformed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, though, selling pressure quickly abated amid an opportunistic mindset among investors eagerly awaiting a dip. In addition, the details of the report were not as foreboding as the headline, and knee-jerk selling, suggested. Tucked in the report was a line indicating that some \"China and trade experts\" were still optimistic about a deal in the coming weeks.</p><p>Leading the afternoon comeback was the energy sector (+1.0%), which found reprieve amid a 3% rebound in oil prices ($56.91, +1.70, +3.1%).

The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%.

The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%.

Stocks cut losses throughout the afternoon, leaving the benchmark index down 0.4% for the session -- comparable to the losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%), and Russell 2000 (-0.4%).</p><p>The negative-sounding headline conflicted with the optimistic tone struck by top White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Ross just last night. Also transpiring last night was the U.S. Senate passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, much to the contempt of China. Altogether, it seemed like a good time to take profits, especially if the Dec. 15 tariffs still go into effect.</p><p>The trade-sensitive areas of the market like the S&amp;P 500 materials (-1.2%), industrials (-0.8%), and information technology (-0.7%) sectors led the decline. The communication services sector (-0.8%), which contains many growth-oriented stocks, also underperformed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, though, selling pressure quickly abated amid an opportunistic mindset among investors eagerly awaiting a dip. In addition, the details of the report were not as foreboding as the headline, and knee-jerk selling, suggested. Tucked in the report was a line indicating that some \"China and trade experts\" were still optimistic about a deal in the coming weeks.</p><p>Leading the afternoon comeback was the energy sector (+1.0%), which found reprieve amid a 3% rebound in oil prices ($56.91, +1.70, +3.1%). The defensive-oriented utilities (+0.6%), consumer staples (+0.2%), and real estate (+0.03%) sectors also finished in positive territory.</p><p>Shares of Target (TGT 126.43, +15.58, +14.1%) climbed 14% after the company impressed investors with its stellar results and upbeat guidance. Lowe's (LOW 117.83, +4.43, +3.9%) also beat earnings estimates and raised its FY20 EPS guidance.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries continued to benefit from a defensive mindset, which sent yields lower in a curve-flattening trade. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.91.</p><p>Separately, the release of the FOMC Minutes from the October meeting didn't draw much attention, as it was consistent with the prevailing view about monetary policy since that meeting. Economic data was limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, which declined 2.2% following a 9.6% increase in the prior week.</p><p>On Thursday, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Philadelphia Fed Index for November, Existing Home Sales for October, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for October.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +28.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +24.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.3% YTDRussell 2000 +18.0% YTD</p><p>16:21</p><p>CASH Meta Financial to sell community bank division to Central Bank; announces new common stock share repurchase program; reits guidance (32.82 -0.38)</p><p>Included in the sale are all of MetaBank's community bank branches located in Iowa and South Dakota, as well as deposits and fixed assets related thereto, representing approximately $270 million of deposits. Also included in the sale are approximately $265 million of loans. Following the closing of the transaction, MetaBank will retain approximately $935 million of loans associated with MetaBank's community bank division that will run-off over time and will be serviced by Central following the closing. The branches will be rebranded as Central Bank following the closing of the transaction.

Stocks cut losses throughout the afternoon, leaving the benchmark index down 0.4% for the session -- comparable to the losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%), and Russell 2000 (-0.4%).</p><p>The negative-sounding headline conflicted with the optimistic tone struck by top White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Ross just last night. Also transpiring last night was the U.S. Senate passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, much to the contempt of China. Altogether, it seemed like a good time to take profits, especially if the Dec. 15 tariffs still go into effect.</p><p>The trade-sensitive areas of the market like the S&amp;P 500 materials (-1.2%), industrials (-0.8%), and information technology (-0.7%) sectors led the decline. The communication services sector (-0.8%), which contains many growth-oriented stocks, also underperformed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, though, selling pressure quickly abated amid an opportunistic mindset among investors eagerly awaiting a dip. In addition, the details of the report were not as foreboding as the headline, and knee-jerk selling, suggested. Tucked in the report was a line indicating that some \"China and trade experts\" were still optimistic about a deal in the coming weeks.</p><p>Leading the afternoon comeback was the energy sector (+1.0%), which found reprieve amid a 3% rebound in oil prices ($56.91, +1.70, +3.1%). The defensive-oriented utilities (+0.6%), consumer staples (+0.2%), and real estate (+0.03%) sectors also finished in positive territory.</p><p>Shares of Target (TGT 126.43, +15.58, +14.1%) climbed 14% after the company impressed investors with its stellar results and upbeat guidance. Lowe's (LOW 117.83, +4.43, +3.9%) also beat earnings estimates and raised its FY20 EPS guidance.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries continued to benefit from a defensive mindset, which sent yields lower in a curve-flattening trade. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.91.</p><p>Separately, the release of the FOMC Minutes from the October meeting didn't draw much attention, as it was consistent with the prevailing view about monetary policy since that meeting. Economic data was limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, which declined 2.2% following a 9.6% increase in the prior week.</p><p>On Thursday, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Philadelphia Fed Index for November, Existing Home Sales for October, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for October.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +28.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +24.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.3% YTDRussell 2000 +18.0% YTD</p><p>16:21</p><p>CASH Meta Financial to sell community bank division to Central Bank; announces new common stock share repurchase program; reits guidance (32.82 -0.38)</p><p>Included in the sale are all of MetaBank's community bank branches located in Iowa and South Dakota, as well as deposits and fixed assets related thereto, representing approximately $270 million of deposits. Also included in the sale are approximately $265 million of loans. Following the closing of the transaction, MetaBank will retain approximately $935 million of loans associated with MetaBank's community bank division that will run-off over time and will be serviced by Central following the closing. The branches will be rebranded as Central Bank following the closing of the transaction.

Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%.

Stocks cut losses throughout the afternoon, leaving the benchmark index down 0.4% for the session -- comparable to the losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%), and Russell 2000 (-0.4%).</p><p>The negative-sounding headline conflicted with the optimistic tone struck by top White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Ross just last night. Also transpiring last night was the U.S. Senate passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, much to the contempt of China. Altogether, it seemed like a good time to take profits, especially if the Dec. 15 tariffs still go into effect.</p><p>The trade-sensitive areas of the market like the S&amp;P 500 materials (-1.2%), industrials (-0.8%), and information technology (-0.7%) sectors led the decline. The communication services sector (-0.8%), which contains many growth-oriented stocks, also underperformed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, though, selling pressure quickly abated amid an opportunistic mindset among investors eagerly awaiting a dip. In addition, the details of the report were not as foreboding as the headline, and knee-jerk selling, suggested. Tucked in the report was a line indicating that some \"China and trade experts\" were still optimistic about a deal in the coming weeks.</p><p>Leading the afternoon comeback was the energy sector (+1.0%), which found reprieve amid a 3% rebound in oil prices ($56.91, +1.70, +3.1%). The defensive-oriented utilities (+0.6%), consumer staples (+0.2%), and real estate (+0.03%) sectors also finished in positive territory.</p><p>Shares of Target (TGT 126.43, +15.58, +14.1%) climbed 14% after the company impressed investors with its stellar results and upbeat guidance. Lowe's (LOW 117.83, +4.43, +3.9%) also beat earnings estimates and raised its FY20 EPS guidance.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries continued to benefit from a defensive mindset, which sent yields lower in a curve-flattening trade. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.91.</p><p>Separately, the release of the FOMC Minutes from the October meeting didn't draw much attention, as it was consistent with the prevailing view about monetary policy since that meeting.

Stocks cut losses throughout the afternoon, leaving the benchmark index down 0.4% for the session -- comparable to the losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%), and Russell 2000 (-0.4%).</p><p>The negative-sounding headline conflicted with the optimistic tone struck by top White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Ross just last night. Also transpiring last night was the U.S. Senate passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, much to the contempt of China. Altogether, it seemed like a good time to take profits, especially if the Dec. 15 tariffs still go into effect.</p><p>The trade-sensitive areas of the market like the S&amp;P 500 materials (-1.2%), industrials (-0.8%), and information technology (-0.7%) sectors led the decline. The communication services sector (-0.8%), which contains many growth-oriented stocks, also underperformed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, though, selling pressure quickly abated amid an opportunistic mindset among investors eagerly awaiting a dip. In addition, the details of the report were not as foreboding as the headline, and knee-jerk selling, suggested. Tucked in the report was a line indicating that some \"China and trade experts\" were still optimistic about a deal in the coming weeks.</p><p>Leading the afternoon comeback was the energy sector (+1.0%), which found reprieve amid a 3% rebound in oil prices ($56.91, +1.70, +3.1%). The defensive-oriented utilities (+0.6%), consumer staples (+0.2%), and real estate (+0.03%) sectors also finished in positive territory.</p><p>Shares of Target (TGT 126.43, +15.58, +14.1%) climbed 14% after the company impressed investors with its stellar results and upbeat guidance. Lowe's (LOW 117.83, +4.43, +3.9%) also beat earnings estimates and raised its FY20 EPS guidance.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries continued to benefit from a defensive mindset, which sent yields lower in a curve-flattening trade. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 1.74%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.91.</p><p>Separately, the release of the FOMC Minutes from the October meeting didn't draw much attention, as it was consistent with the prevailing view about monetary policy since that meeting. Economic data was limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, which declined 2.2% following a 9.6% increase in the prior week.</p><p>On Thursday, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Philadelphia Fed Index for November, Existing Home Sales for October, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for October.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +28.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +24.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +19.3% YTDRussell 2000 +18.0% YTD</p><p>16:21</p><p>CASH Meta Financial to sell community bank division to Central Bank; announces new common stock share repurchase program; reits guidance (32.82 -0.38)</p><p>Included in the sale are all of MetaBank's community bank branches located in Iowa and South Dakota, as well as deposits and fixed assets related thereto, representing approximately $270 million of deposits.

Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.</p><p>Facebook (FB 164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), Alphabet (GOOG 1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and Apple (AAPL 173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%.

According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the Factory Orders report for April on Tuesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +10.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.5% YTDRussell 2000 +9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD</p><p>16:18</p><p>VRRM Verra Mobility commences offering of 15 mln shares of Class A common stock to be offered by a selling stockholder of the company (13.80 -0.18)</p><p>16:16</p><p>LGND Ligand Pharma executed and delivered an OmniAb platform license agreement with GigaGen (110.15 +2.77)</p><p>Under the license, GigaGen will be able to use OmniAb platform rodents and birds to discover fully human mono- and bispecific antibodies. \"We are eligible to receive development and regulatory milestone payments and tiered royalties in the mid-single-digit range for each product incorporating or delivering an OmniAb antibody.\"</p><p>16:16</p><p>AVB AvalonBay reports total rental revenue for established communities for two months ended May 30, 2018 increased 3.4% (203.81 +0.83)</p><p>Co announces that total rental revenue for Established Communities for the two months ended May 31, 2019 increased 3.4% over the prior year period.

Also transpiring last night was the U.S. Senate passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, much to the contempt of China. Altogether, it seemed like a good time to take profits, especially if the Dec. 15 tariffs still go into effect.</p><p>The trade-sensitive areas of the market like the S&amp;P 500 materials (-1.2%), industrials (-0.8%), and information technology (-0.7%) sectors led the decline. The communication services sector (-0.8%), which contains many growth-oriented stocks, also underperformed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, though, selling pressure quickly abated amid an opportunistic mindset among investors eagerly awaiting a dip.

Stocks cut losses throughout the afternoon, leaving the benchmark index down 0.4% for the session -- comparable to the losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%), Nasdaq Composite (-0.5%), and Russell 2000 (-0.4%).</p><p>The negative-sounding headline conflicted with the optimistic tone struck by top White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Ross just last night. Also transpiring last night was the U.S. Senate passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, much to the contempt of China. Altogether, it seemed like a good time to take profits, especially if the Dec. 15 tariffs still go into effect.</p><p>The trade-sensitive areas of the market like the S&amp;P 500 materials (-1.2%), industrials (-0.8%), and information technology (-0.7%) sectors led the decline. The communication services sector (-0.8%), which contains many growth-oriented stocks, also underperformed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, though, selling pressure quickly abated amid an opportunistic mindset among investors eagerly awaiting a dip. In addition, the details of the report were not as foreboding as the headline, and knee-jerk selling, suggested. Tucked in the report was a line indicating that some \"China and trade experts\" were still optimistic about a deal in the coming weeks.</p><p>Leading the afternoon comeback was the energy sector (+1.0%), which found reprieve amid a 3% rebound in oil prices ($56.91, +1.70, +3.1%).

Lowe's (LOW 117.83, +4.43, +3.9%) also beat earnings estimates and raised its FY20 EPS guidance.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries continued to benefit from a defensive mindset, which sent yields lower in a curve-flattening trade.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%.

The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day.
