Such changes could expose tech companies to more lawsuits.</p><p>The order asks the FCC to examine whether actions related to the editing of content by social media companies should potentially lead to the platform forfeiting its protections under section 230.</p><p>It requires the agency to look at whether a social media platform uses deceptive policies to moderate content and if its policies are inconsistent with its terms of service.</p><p>Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election.

Welcome back,  everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  It is  Wednesday, January 24th.  The top stories right now 8:00 A.M. on the East  Coast.  America First on the world stage.  President Trump and his  administration heads to Davos to tout the U.S. economy and lure big-name  investors to America.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin making headline  down the ground in Davos already.  The dollar is down this morning after  Secretary Mnuchin said a weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy.  He's  not the only cabinet member making headlines.  Earlier this morning, I  spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about the  delegation to the World Economic Forum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  I think  what this message is going to be is America First is not America alone.  We  need to partner, you know, as I said earlier, not one of us has the ability  to do this alone.  So we need to partner with the private secretary.  We  need to partner with our allies.  We've seen those discussions with North  Korea.  We've seen that in Syria.  We've seen that in Iran.  We have to  build coalitions to be able to attack these threats together and I think --  I think that's what you'll hear a lot about.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The president's trip to Davos comes amid another case of  trickle-down tax reform.  Starbucks, the latest company passing on savings  from the new tax law to its employees.  The announcement coming on the  heels of similar news from Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Verizon and that  was just yesterday.  What the coffee giant is brewing up for its records  coming up.  New and more records from markets, the NASDAQ yesterday surged  52 points after Netflix stock jumped 10 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 also added  all-time high this morning after another gain yesterday of 6 points quarter  of a percent higher.  The Dow pulled back yesterday but this morning we  look at momentum on the upside we're expecting a pretty strong opening for  the broader averages.  Take a look at Futures with the Dow Industrials now  at the highs of the morning.  We're expecting a gain of 80 points right out  of the gate a third of a percent higher, S&amp;P 500 also higher by a quarter  of a percent, and the NASDAQ adding on to yesterday's record performance.  </p><p> In Europe, this morning different story.  Take a look at the European  indices lower across the board worst performer in the U.K. FT-100 down one  half of one percent.  In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher with  the exception of Japan as you see the Nikkei averaging Japan down three- quarters of a percent overnight.  Earnings, the story on Wall Street once  again General Electric, Ford Motor, Comcast, all among the big names  reporting their fourth quarter numbers.  Comcast delivered a double beat  earnings and revenue above estimates.  General Electric missed estimates  but look at the stock, it's up one and one and a half percent.  Clearly,  investors are seeing some value in G.E. shares after a 40 percent sell-off  despite that miss on earnings.</p><p> Trouble patching the patch, well, Intel is still struggling to repair the  glaring flaw in its chips sparking new concerns this morning for  cybersecurity.  Plus, hackers cash in on the cryptocurrency craze.  The  stunning amount stolen from the billions raised in initial coin offerings  amid the Bitcoin boom.  We will tell you about that.  Also coming up this  morning, joining the conversation Energy Secretary Rick Perry is with us  this morning along with Dow CEO Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Cisco Chuck  Robbins is here, and the CEO of Campbell Soup Denise Morrison.  </p><p> Plus, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in.  You don't  want to miss the moments with them.  We got a big hour coming up.  First,  this top story this hour, America First on the world stage.  President  Trump headed to the World Economic Forum in Davos.  Tonight, he's expected  to arrive tomorrow.  Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin already on the  ground here in Switzerland and he's making news.  He had comments this  morning saying that he welcomes a weakening dollar because it is good for  trade.  That sent the dollar to fresh new lows this morning.  Though  Mnuchin also emphasized America is open for business.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY:  We have a great  story to tell, lots of important meetings.  It's truly all about economic  growth opportunities to invest free and fair trade, and kind of -- so we're  looking forward to it.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can do that.  If you don't want to, you don't have  to.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's fine.  This is coming as companies here in U.S. are  giving back to their employees in the wake of the tax reform overhaul.   President Trump just tweeted this, this morning.  He says, tremendous  investment by companies from all over the world being made in America.   There has never been anything like it.  The president writes now, Disney,  JPMorgan Chase, and many others, massive regulation reduction tax cuts  making the U.S. a powerhouse once again.  He says, long way to go, jobs,  jobs, jobs.  Joining me now to weigh in is the Chairman and CEO of E.Y.,  Global Chairman and CEO Mark Weinberger.  Mark, it's great to see you.  </p><p> MARK WEINBERGER, GLOBAL CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF E.Y.:  Always a pleasure,  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So I know that you have been  on panels this morning.  You're talking to a lot of your customers and  clients about what's taking place in the U.S. and the tax reform bill that  is having a really big impact.</p><p> WEINBERGER:  It is, Maria.  We're seeing, you know, obviously, it doesn't  make the U.S. a tax heaven but what it does do is give us a competitor rate  and it allows companies to move their capital around without having to pay  that extra level of tax.  We are seeing supply changed being reevaluated,  operations and investment being expanded and as you said, we're seeing a  whole bunch of things like increasing wages, bonuses, pension payments,  healthcare payments.  The real question is you know it has been are the  businesses going to give back to shareholders and stock buybacks and  dividends or investing in capital and labor?  I think you're going to see  all of that but it's a positive -- definitely a positive momentum here in  Davos.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And all of the above is positive?  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  All of the above are positive, gives back in the economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But let me ask you this because we see this tax plan having an  immediate effect with the companies announcing these things, but this is  really going to have a longer-term effect, isn't it?</p><p> WEINBERGER:  That is a great point because everyone is saying, what's this  going to do next quarter?  This is a landmark tax reform bill that  structurally changes business taxes like we haven't even done since 1960s.   We talk about the 1986 Act.  That was a lot of individual changes.   International rules are written in the 60s.  This completely changes how a  company thinks about where to put his capital.  It's not just U.S.  businesses.  We're talking to many Asian companies, European companies, who  are looking to invest in the U.S. to get advantage of the full expensing,  the lower corporate rate, and a number of other benefits of just being a  great market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  I was speaking to a European player recently and  he said, we had a whole plan to invest in Europe.  We've shifted that plan  and now we'll be investing in America which is -- </p><p> WEINBERGER:  We'll see more of that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which is very positive.  All right.  There's that.  The  president and his administration getting high marks on the tax reform  package.  No doubt about it.  But then there's trade where there are some  questions.  The president yesterday announced steep tariffs on solar  panels, on washing machines while 11 Pacific Rim countries agreed to forge  a new commercial block that excludes the U.S., obviously, the U.S. pulling  out of the TPP, what's your take on what's happening with regards to trade?  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  So I think the speech is you and your league, you talked about  it's going to be really important because the president has to balance and  enforcing the laws.  I mean this, you know, putting tariffs on solar isn't,  you know, changing the whole landscape of trade, in fact, from 2012 and  2015, we had tariffs on solar.  So there are really uncertainty now is  where is he go next?  And we need to be involved in trade deals around the  world.  We can't be left out.  Ninety-five percent of the world's  consumers, 80 percent of GDP growth is outside the United States.  So  businesses want to be able to go there.  The U.S. is and open market.  We  let everybody in.  Trade deals are good for businesses.  In the U.S., they  create jobs.  So the question is going to be, does this lead to more and  more retaliation and trade wars?  Or is this enforcement of existing deals  and renegotiations of NAFTA or renegotiations of course, and discussions  with China to get to a positive trade deal?  That's what everyone is going  to be watching.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So one of the issues with NAFTA is it basically sets the  companies, look, you can have a factory overseas in Mexico and you can  produce cheap stuff and then you can send them back to the U.S. and sell  them in U.S., so of course, companies are going to do just that in higher  workers at a much lower wage in Mexico.  And then once NAFTA was completed  and then everybody started doing that, that became the template for all  trade deals?</p><p> WEINBERGER:  Well, it's true.  But if you think -- but there are so many  examples where you know, well, I mean how do you even implement as you  don't know what the cargo -- component parts going over and back across the  border in Canada six times.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  And iPhone is 800 different companies worked on an iPhone in  31 different countries and the component parts all come together into the  United States, so --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what are they going to do, pay a tariff every time they  cross --</p><p> WEINBERGER:  They couldn't do it.  You couldn't afford an iPhone if you had  a tariff every level of the company in the United States.  You couldn't get  the labor done if you try to bring it all back to the United States.  So we  need to understand that this helps the United States too to have these  trade deals in place.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So there's got to a balance between fair trade but also not  hurting the customer because ultimately that's going to fall on the  consumer who's going to pay more for a product because the company that  makes it is paying a tariff?  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  Absolutely.  It's like a tax here that we just reduced.  So  but you're in the nail in the head, Maria, as always.  The pivot we got to  watch and see right now from feeding up on our trading partners.  First, a  lot of bad deals and upgrading necessarily trade deals to starting to  negotiating positively the new deals.  Seeing if NAFTA will get done this  year.  We have a lot of negotiations coming up this month, of course, the  Mexican elections coming up on midterms and coming up makes it hard.   Mercosur is positively moving forward, so we're going to try and negotiate  that.  We got to make progress in those deals and that will set a good  signal. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you, Mark.  And turn to -- turn to Bitcoin  because according to new research, you and Ernst &amp; Young did recently more  than 10 percent of funds raised through initial coin offerings are lost or  stolen in hacker attacks?  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  Yes.  Well, this is -- as we know, it's a really complicated  area and, you know, these coin offerings are plenty.  There's over a  hundred different indexes out there where they're coming in there's  offerings.  They are obviously susceptible to fraud and theft.  They become  more of an investment than a currency and so I think appropriately you have  the government to look at it where we point it out there is that investors  -- it's not an investor.  It's really a tool to be a currency.  You have to  be cautious how you're investing in it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One more risk to watch around Bitcoin?  </p><p> WEINBERGER:  Always, a lot more.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mark, great to see you.</p><p> WEINBERGER:  Always, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning, Mark Weinberger  or EY.  Coming up, General Electric releases its 4th quarter results  missing earnings and revenue expectations.  We'll break those numbers.   Nonetheless, the stock is up 1-1/2 percent.  And then more concerns over  cybersecurity, Intel is telling customers to stop installing a software  patch release to address a security flaw in their computer chips.  We've  got the details next.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are live this week at the World Economic  Forum here in Davos, Switzerland.  President Trump will be here tomorrow.   Joining me right now and a first time Fox Business interview DowDuPont  Executive Chairman, CEO Andrew Liveris who is also the head of the now  disbanded president -- Americans Manufacturing Council.  Good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No.  We're coming into this meeting there was a lot of  optimism.  But would you say that this is one of the most optimistic Davos  meetings you've ever seen? </p><p> LIVERIS:  Definitely one of the most optimistic and also one full of  expectation for the president visit here on Friday.  So really the topic is  the president's visit.  So most of us are getting all of that meetings done  before tomorrow because I think it's going to tilt very quickly to what the  president is going to say and kind of his team is kind of coming in already  with meeting some of them.  I had a couple of meetings today with U.S.  officials.  I've never seen such a strong U.S. delegation.  So this is kind  of opposite to America First thing.  I mean this is America engaged and as  a global company, this is a positive thing.  And I think my European  colleagues and the rest of the world colleagues Asian, Middle East, Africa,  they're all kind of waiting to see how the U.S. will posture itself.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is a really good way to put it American engaged, I like  that.  How is the president doing in your view?  I know that, you know, you  were on that council.  You were the chairman.  It was disbanded.  There was  upset at that time, but how would you grade President Trump's by now?  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, from a year ago to present day even through the year with  the disbanding of the council, I've been very consistent on that answer.   This is a very business-friendly president, very business friendly  administration, so I give him a strong A.  I mean, you know, the tax reform  you just talked about I mean but not just tax reform, the regulatory work  is being done.  It's astonishing.  I've never imagined that much progress  in 12 months or so and of course other work that I'm involved in which I'm  on secretary of (INAUDIBLE) workforce reinvention counsel.  This is the  apprenticeship task force which is to redefine what the American system is  producing in terms of skilled workers with digitalization approaching us.   I'm very encouraged by that work and that early stuff that we're doing to  change the way America supplies workers we need and so I'm very -- I give - - I give it a strong A.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's very important because we're seeing machine learning take  over jobs and we're seeing new skillsets really required.  OK.  So positive  marks on the tax reform package.  We know that.  We know what's going on  but all of these companies coming out and saying how positive it is, but  we're also seeing a debate around the trade story and that's I want to get  your take on because the president issued new tariffs on imports of solar  panels and washing machines from Asia, what do you make of this?  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, so, you know, now that -- you just said tax reform  happening and let's skip the details of that finalized.  But trade is of  course on his agenda and the business agenda are topic he ran for office on  and there's a lot of work to be done whether it be the redoing of NAFTA and  whatever form it takes, the China discussion, and of course, all the things  that the president worries about which is giving Americans jobs that they  can count on for the future.  You just mentioned machine learning and  digitalization.  We all know that's as big a potential job killer as  anything in the trade agenda.  So we've got all to engage our workers.   We've got to engage the American public to actually put the facts in front  of the table of what is the trade topic.  And it isn't -- look at Dow, I  mean I export from the United States to all countries of the world.  </p><p> One in five of my jobs is based on America being a trader, so we got to  keep trade.  But what the president is doing is he wants to change the  rules of engagement.  And I think we all have to engage in that topic, so  what are these rules?  OK.  It isn't just about putting tariffs on and on  that tariff question, I mean we Dow make a polysilicon.  That's a -- the  raw material for solar panels.  We've been excluded from the China market  for the last five years, so that's not far.  So these tariffs on solar  panels is a way of sending a signal that it can't be one way.  It can't be  one-way trade and I support the president on that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is really important because you've actually seen firsthand  the impact of much cheaper products coming from China.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Absolutely.  And then, so American workers, we can't -- we are  now having plants at risks, factories at risks because I can't access the  China market and they favor their own producers, yet the solar panels are  being -- coming over here and killing our solar panel industry in the  United States.  So there needs to be a recalibration with lots of  conversation with Secretary Ross in the USTR on this topic.  So that's an  example of recalibrating the rules of trade and I'm all for that, but I  think we need to get the facts on the table, get the rhetoric out of room,  and, you know, what are these rules of engagement in terms of fair trade.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is the first explanation that really I've heard that make  so much sense because you're right there and you're feeling it firsthand.   The worry is of course, are we going to see retaliation?  I mean are you  going to China even get more secluded and even more protectionist in terms  of their solar panels?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, since antiquity and city-states, and bartering view, of  course, get tit-for-tat.  You, of course, get retaliation.  This is what  negotiation is.  This president is a negotiator.  We have a team of  negotiations in the U.S. side.  I'm a businessperson.  I'm going  negotiator.  As long as we end up at the right spot, I think the rhetoric  and the retaliation may will be part of the process.  I'm convinced based  on speed of tax reform and the speed of regulatory reform, this will not be  one of these things that takes a lot of time.  So I would encourage all my  colleagues certainly our company to be engaged, to be at the table on what  these tit-for-tats will be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think we're going to see more of this like for example  as it relates to aluminum and steel because the president did say -- he  mentioned aluminum and steel and I think that is getting some people  nervous that we're going to see more and more of this kind of tariff  behavior and it's --</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, I'm not in -- I'm not in the room that decides which ones  but I am telling you, if I look at chemicals, for example, we have a  surplus.  We're the second largest exporter from the United States.  So we  would hate to see if steel and aluminum thing happen and then chemicals,  you know, give restrictions in terms of exporting from the United States  into China or any other country, so I would be counter doing too much tit- for-tat.  But I think this recent one is a strong enough message that the  United States is serious.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  And you've given us phenomenal insight into  this.  Andrew, thank you for that.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Not at all.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You are such a retire as Chairman of DowDuPont later this year  after overseeing its historic deal the merger late last year.  Now, I know  you are reporting earnings.  You're going to be giving us guidelines on all  of this in the coming week.  But what can you tell us in terms of the  timing of integration?  What do you want to say to shareholders in terms of  where you are today?  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, I think our shareholders from our last report to present  day what I'll say and then what I'll say next week with specificity.  This  is on track.  As you said, it's historic, 300 years of corporate history  and to reconfigure these assets in a tax-free way pushing in a hold value  for growth, for three companies, the new Dow which will be the materials  company, the new agricultural company, the new specialty company.  We're on  track.  And look, I can't be happier about the way the cultures of being  assimilating, the integration work.  We've got thousands of people working  on this, not to mention all the help in the consultants' world that you can  find.  It's working and I would tell you that you right now and you'll hear  more next week that it's basically on track.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then in terms of growth look at five years, where does the  growth come from at this company?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well, I got to tell you that the humanity and sustainability  which gets talked about here a lot.  We need products that have full  circulation capability.  So all that work on light-weighting on batteries  and cars, on the next car what that looks like.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Good packaging, what we do with food packaging, what we do with  plastics in the ocean, what we do with carbon emissions, these are all  opportunities for these companies would it be the agricultural one or the  materials one, or the specialty ones, water, and water reuse, waste  management, waste reuse, these are the opportunities that we're addressing  through using out 7500 scientists.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So this is where the growth comes from?  </p><p> LIVERIS:  That's where it comes from.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about regulation.  Obviously, this president has  been rolling back regulations, have you felt it in your sector because I  know other sectors they're not there yet and it sort of the smaller runway,  what have you seen?  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Look, I can't speak strongly enough about how much we've felt it.   It's not just -- it's not just the attitude.  It's being specific and we've  been asked, and it's kind of nice to be consulted to be at the front end of  this, to use science, to say this regulation makes sense.  This one  doesn't.  This administration has been unafraid to roll back regulations  that make no sense.  We felt it.  We're feeling it on our bottom line.  But  more importantly, we're seeing it in a change in attitude on what's the  smarter regulation.  We are for regulation.  We just want the right type of  regulation to actually manage the behaviors of everyone in the value chain.   We're a big player.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the pendulum just swung way too far.  Andrew, it's great to  see you.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Always going to be with you, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Andrew Liveris there.  We'll be right back.   Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live this week from the  World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Speaking with the biggest  names in business and innovation, cybersecurity, of course, one of the  agenda topics here as companies like Intel are asking their companies and  their customers to stop installing a software patch that it released to fix  security flaws on computer chips.  The company says that the patch is can  cause, \"Unpredictable system behavior.\"  Joining me right now to weigh in  on that is the CEO of Cisco Chuck Robbins.  Chuck, it's great to see you.  </p><p> CHUCK ROBBINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CISCO SYSTEMS:  Great to see you,  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I want to talk broadly about what's happening in your  business right now.  But how are you combating the cybersecurity  vulnerability like this one?  </p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, first of all, I think Intel is doing a reasonable job.   It's obviously a significant issue.  In the industry, we all try to come  together when we have these kinds of issues occur and there's a great  cooperative spirit between the major tech companies when we find these  types of issues and we're working through it within just like everybody is,  and I think they're doing the right things.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What can you tell us about I.T. budgets today, Chuck?  I mean  here we are looking at an environment where people are talking about four  percent economic growth.  Your business is the gut to any other business in  a whole host of sectors.  So I want to ask you what you're seeing in terms  of I.T. budgets.  Are managers spending more on your products?</p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, it's early in the year and every year when we start the new  calendar year budgets begin to become more visible as we get into it.  And  we're in the latter part of our quarter now and so we'll be reporting  earnings in a couple weeks and we'll give some insights into that.  But I  think that when you look at what happened here in the country and you look  at tax reform, and you look at the positive feeling here in Davos that you  have at least from an economic perspective, I think that there's a great  deal of optimism around the world right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There really is.  What do you think is powering it?   Because I think from your standpoint it's more than just tax reform, isn't  it?</p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, it is.  And if you look at the economic situation around  the world, it's -- I mean the central banks have done a great job.  You've  got stimulus has been put into the system.  You have had a great, you know,  since the 2008 crisis, we've had a -- we've finally got into a sustained  recovery and now what you see happening that with our business is that as  we've seen here in Davos if you go back three or four years, we were  talking about the internet of things and now the fourth industrial  revolution, and there's no doubt that that's occurring, and no one is  talking about it.  So here we're having conversations about how do we  redefine the architecture inside a vehicle.  Those are the conversations  we're having now.  So technology is permeating every aspect of life and  industry, and as that happens as billions of things become connected.   Obviously, that's good for us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about that because we were talking with Carlo  Stone yesterday and he was saying, everything in a car today is technology  related.  So what areas of business are the most important in terms of  powering your business?  What sectors?</p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, if you look at -- it's happening across every industry  today.  Primarily, we have seen early adoption in manufacturing of this  industrial internet.  We've seen retail move.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sorry about that.  </p><p> ROBBINS:  That's great.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This must mean someone important is arriving.  </p><p> ROBBINS:  I know.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because a helicopter is here making lots of noise but hopefully  they just passed.  So you said manufacturing -- </p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, I just want you to know when I arrived in Davos, I wouldn't  interrupt you like that visitor, you know, we've seen manufacturing.  We've  seen healthcare.  We see connected cars.  We made announcements of CES with  Hyundai.  I meet with a couple of car manufacturers here this week about  what we can do together and then across our broader business just the  connectivity of all these devices, the management of the data, the  cybersecurity issues that are associated with it.  They all provide great  opportunities for us in the future.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because everything is connected today, so tell us how the  Cisco products connect?  </p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, so I think they're circling to come back to see if they --  make sure you heard them the first time.  So when you -- when you look at  the connectivity of all of the platforms, the -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stop.  Just give it a minute first.  It's going back at out,  yes.  </p><p> ROBBINS:  It's (INAUDIBLE) they're going to land right here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're right above us.  </p><p> ROBBINS:  They're going to land.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This helicopter.  </p><p> ROBBINS:  The matter of the issue is as we connect vehicles, as we connect  vending machines, manufacturing facilities whatever they are, Cisco is the  largest machine, the machine connectivity platform.  Then after that, you  have to actually take the data that's created and help our customers move  that data to the place that they need it and whether it's in a public  crowd, whether it's in a private cloud, or whether they want to assess and  manage that data at the edge of the network, the network is going to play a  great role, and then we fundamentally have to drive security in the network  because there is no perimeter to defend it anymore.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wonderful.  Chuck, I'm so sorry.</p><p> ROBBINS:  What did you say?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is -- this is incredible.  We're having a conversation --</p><p> ROBBINS:  We had a funny experienced last year too, you know.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But with the helicopters? </p><p> ROBBINS:  No.  We had one with a camera last year, so --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's right.  Let me ask you real quick in terms of  geography and where you see the best growth right now.  Europe is growing.   The U.S. is obviously a chunk of a four percent growth, is there a corner  of the world that is doing better than others with regard to this kind of  activity?</p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, what I would say is that we see probably more consistent  growth around the world than we've seen in a very long time as evidence by  the discussions going on here.  When we look at the adoption of the  technology, we see emerging countries adopting the technology to try to  solve problems in a massive scale whether it's in India, whether it's in  China.  And then we see obviously developed countries leveraging these  technologies to look at how we make cities smarter that had optimized  traffic and optimized citizen services, so it's really happening  everywhere, it's amazing.  So -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Incredible performance.  So how do you keep this going?</p><p> ROBBINS:  Well, I think that as long as this industrial revolution  continues then we should be at the heart of all of that because as our  customers connect more and more devices, the network is absolutely the  foundation, so --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Chuck, it's good to have you on the show.  Thank you so much.   This is great, this is incredible.  This is actually funny.</p><p> ROBBINS:  They're circling.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're circling.  Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, we will be right  back.  Thank you so much.</p><p> LEIF SHIRAS, TENNIS CHANNEL COMMENTATOR: Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel Court Report, a special presentation For Business.  I'm Leif  Shairs.  Well, the 2018 Austrian Open completed quarterfinal action on day  10 in Melbourne and there was American interest in both the man and woman  draws.  Kyung Chang ended the dream run of Tennessee native Tenny Sandgren  to reach the final four and become the first South Korean to reach the  semifinals at a major.</p><p> Elsewhere, Angelique Kerber made short work of Maidson Keys in their  quarterfinal.  The American never found her game as the German powered away  to an impressive one and two victory.  Don't forget, Tennis Channel's live  coverage of the Australian Open continues Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern.   I'm Leif Sharis.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic  Forum.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, January  24th.  Your top stories right now 8:34 on the East Coast.  The White House  descends on Davos.  President Trump set to leave Washington for the World  Economic Forum tonight.  The trip comes as the White House makes good on  the Commander-in-Chief's promise to put America first, this follows the  overwhelming success of the President's tax plan. </p><p> Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin already on the ground and he is making  news, the dollar is sliding this morning after Secretary Mnuchin said a  weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy and trade during a press  conference in Davos.  Markets this morning are rallying, take a look at the  futures indicating that we will see a higher opening for the broader  averages.  This right here is the high of the morning.  Up better than 100  points in unchartered territory once again. S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ also in  unchartered territory.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P hit new record-highs  yesterday.  </p><p> Ahead of the President's trip, investors are watching earning this morning  from the likes of General Electric and Comcast among others.  G.E. reported  earnings and revenue which were below expectation and yet the stock is  trading higher.  The stock up 2-1/2 percent as investors look for value  after a huge selloff.  Comcast also topped expectations although that stock  is lower.  European indices this morning are lower.  The stocks in Europe,  take a look, are weaker across the board pretty much.  FT-100 down one-half  of a half percent, the CAC quarante and DAX are also lower.  In Asia  overnight, markets close mostly higher, take a look.  And as you see, the  markets were higher with the exception of Japan which was down three- quarters of one percent.</p><p> Topping our news this half an hour, President Trump and America First at  Davos.  More than a dozen high-level members of the administration are  arriving here to discuss economics, trade, cybersecurity and a lot more  with the political and corporate leaders gathers here.  Joining me right  now is the United States Secretary of Energy, Secretary Rick Perry.   Secretary, it's great to see you.</p><p> RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  The President's America  First message, how do you think it will be received?</p><p> PERRY:  Well, I think he have to understand what America First means to the  President and the administration.  It's really pretty simple from my  perspective.  This is about America being competitive around the globe.   When folks were thinking about where you want to buy your energy from,  where do you want that next load of LNG to come from?  We want you to think  about America first.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good way to put it.  Well, the President has  stressed really tapping into our oil reserves in America.  Let's talk about  that and where the opportunities are from your standpoint.  </p><p> PERRY:  Yes.  Well, you think about 10 plus years ago and then 2005 we were  -- besides ourselves, if you will and behind, other places where the oil  and gas was coming from, you know, we had founded all, Peak oil.  We heard  all of those stories and then, you know, by the grace of God and some  technology and a god by named George Mitchell from Texas, hydraulic  fracturing came into play in a really big way and we were able to go into  those tight shell formations and develop that which is now creating an  absolute revolution in the oil and gas industry and completely changing the  geopolitical dynamics in the world with America being at the forefront.  We  are now the number one oil and gas producing nation on the face of the  earth.  I mean, who would have thought that a decade ago that that would  have been true.  But it puts us in a very unique place.  And here is what I  try to share with all of our allies and for all the audience here at Davos  is that the United States is not just exporting energy, we're exporting  freedom.  We're exporting to our allies in Europe.  The opportunity to  truly have a choice of where do you buy your energy from.  That's freedom,  and that kind of freedom is priceless.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you're making because for  a long time America was reliant on places like Saudi Arabia and Russia to  get energy but today it's a completely different situation in America.  How  significant is it?  I mean, how would you characterize the supply that will  be coming from the U.S. or to the global markets.</p><p> PERRY:  You know, I'm not sure anything since World War II has been anymore  dynamic from my perspective than they shift in the energy supply, energy  control if you will.  And again, the United States in the back controlling  a country with this industry.  It's about literally freeing up our allies  around the world.  Letting them know that we're going to be there for them,  there's no strings attached when you buy American LNG.  So, that is --  that's world-changing.  And truly, this president, that's his message here.   Is that the United States is -- it's a new day.  The fossil fuels that  we're going to be relying them on for decades to come are going to be  available.  Now, is our technology going to be able to allow us to use it  wiser?  With better results for the environment?  Absolutely.  The CCCU,  the carbon capture utilization, we're doing projects with Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> I'll see my counterpart (INAUDIBLE) today on a panel, we'll talk about the  projects that we're working on together.  The UAE, Qatar, all of those  countries as we come together to develop and supply the rest of the world  with the power so that they can have manufacturing (INAUDIBLE) in Africa.   Being able to, you know, literally turn the lights on when the sun goes  down so that their children can read, the people are safer.  I mean, all of  that is partly because of American ingenuity and our abilities to not  believe the naysayers that people is here and you're not going to find any  more of this</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is there -- is there a way to characterize the amount of  supply that will be coming from the U.S.?</p><p> PERRY:  Well, you know, I hesitate to be a forecaster of what the home  markets are going to be.  I'll leave that up to people that are  substantially more into that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  You're the Energy Secretary.  Let me ask --</p><p> PERRY:  My job is to make sure that it's -- the abundant supply and I want  to get people together so that they know that America is going to be a  reliant supplier of that energy.  The price will work itself though.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised where prices are by the way because it feels  like the markets are focused more on the potential for terrorism or  disruption.  Where oil is right now.  </p><p> PERRY:  Well, those are realities of the world.  But the fact is that we  have an amazing I mean, you think about Anwar that the Congress just opened  up again.  You know, the previous administration closed it down, Congress  working with the administration said, you know what, those nine million  barrels are really important to the United States and to the world.  So  opening up markets that the previous administration have closed.  I think  it's in a very powerful message around the world that we're going to be a  reliant supplier of energy into the foreseeable future.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  And I think that's why there's change happening in  Saudi Arabia.</p><p> PERRY:  Indeed.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There is incredible change happening in other countries because  they see what to expect from the U.S.  By the way, what was behind the  decision not to drill off of the coast of Florida?  </p><p> PERRY:  You know, I think that the administration through the Department of  Interior sensitive to the issues there.  There is plenty of space out there  whether it's in the gulf, whether it's in Anwar, whether it's other areas  that we can develop the energy resource we have.  You know, the people of  Florida said, hey listen, we don't want to add any new drilling platforms,  the administration respected that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that was OK with the (INAUDIBLE) let me ask you about the  President's news this week and that is these tariffs on solar panels and on  washing machines, there is some conversation happening and as you know  about worries about potential trade wars, about what China will do in  response.  Should we worry about a different trade stance from this  administration?  </p><p> PERRY:  They shouldn't be worrying about this administration from the  standpoint of transparency and fairness.  That's what Donald Trump is all  about.  You want to compete against the United States, bring it but don't  subsidize in a way that it's unfair, don't get into the market and try to  gobble up all the market and then all of a sudden after you choked  everybody else out of market, guess what, prices go up.  This is a  president that says, look, I get it about competition.  But you're going to  compete fairly, and you're going to compete on a level-playing field.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the President said that as it relates to jobs as well and  when you look at the energy story, that's a real job creator.  Can you  characterize what we might see from all of the drilling and the fracturing  that will happen in terms of job creation?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well, it's going to continue on.  I mean, that's obviously for the  states that --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And consistent.  </p><p> PERRY:  And it's not just the jobs right in those states where it's  happening, it's upstream or excuse me, it's downstream from that.  It's the  manufacturing.  We think there is an incredible potential in the  Appalachian region to turn that area into an absolute job-creating giant  with the development of the Marcell or Shell with the other fossil fuels  that are available there.  You can duplicate the footprint of what you see  along in Texas Gulf Coast in that Appalachian region and the jobs that get  created.  I'm promising you the governor of West Virginia and Ohio and  Kentucky and Pennsylvania, they're going to be staying and they're saluting  and saying, Mr. President, let's go, let's go make this happen, let's go  make America great again.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they're -- and these are high-paying jobs.  </p><p> PERRY:  Indeed.  They are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you like the job?  How do you like the role of energy  secretary?  What's new that you can tell us with this?</p><p> PERRY:  Most interesting job I've ever had.  Best job ever had was governor  of Texas but this one is the most interesting and the coolest job mostly  because of the 17 national labs that are out there involved in everything  from cybersecurity to the next wave of small-moderate reactors to, you  know, just the most fascinating new things that are going to be on the  horizon for America.  Our national labs are involved in. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary, thank you for your leadership.  </p><p> PERRY:  You're welcome.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Secretary Rick Perry.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Electric reported earnings that were  below expectations, this morning.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the  New York Stock Exchange watching the stock trade up -- Nicole.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We know that  General Electric has been in a turnaround phase.  In the last August,  Flannery came on as the new CEO to turn this thing around.  Today, look at  that, just in the last half hour, you -- a short time ago, we're saying it  was up 2-1/2 percent.  And look now, it's up 5.2 percent.  So, what  happened here?  We did see ultimately, that the company in the latest  quarter, they're really focusing on the overall -- the restructuring plan.   The weakness that they've seen in operating profit and the revenue but  ultimately that they're focusing on the aviation and health care divisions  where they are seeing some strength.  </p><p> There has been talk about this company being beaten down, and don't forget,  it's down about 45 percent in the last 12 months.  Is now the time to  finally get into General Electric?  I know you've had this conversation  with many of your guests, but there's been talk of dividing up the company  in some way.  But that the turnaround and restructuring is underway, but  you are seeing the stock now getting a big jump, Maria.  Now, it's up 5-1/2  percent at 17.78.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you, Nicole.  From Disney to Verizon and  Starbucks, more U.S. companies handing out bonus checks, hiking wages for  their workers after the tax reform overhaul.  Joining me right now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Stu, it's  just incredible the number of companies.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, it's a flood.  Look, I  would call it a flood.  Look, in the last 24 hours, we've got Disney, a  thousand bucks to 125,000 employees, Verizon, I think is 2,500 bucks worth  of stock to the employees; J.P. Morgan 10 percent wage increases for a big  swath of their people.  I mean, it's a long list, just in last 24 hours.   It's clear, I think American business was on trial, they got everything  they wanted from the tax cut deal, and now, they are indeed passing it  along to the -- to the customers and also to their employees.  But, you  know, the big pass-through, I think, is still to come.  I think that will  come from the big tech companies of this world, when they repatriate all of  that money.  I think a lot of it goes to shareholders.  And looking for  stock buybacks like Comcast, for example, and I'm looking also for a  dividend increases.  That's the next round in this flood of pass-throughs  and givebacks.  Here it comes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a great point.  I would also add on to financial  services, Stu, because, you know, the banks really haven't even had the  actual impact of regulation rollback.  You know,  that's to come, so  there's this enormous runway there as well.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, look, it's a flood, that's what I'm saying.  By the way, how  is Davos treating you?  Are being nice to you?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's good.  I mean, you know, everyone's talking about  President Trump.</p><p>VARNEY:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming tomorrow, and wondering what he's going to say, so he's  definitely making a splash even before he arrives, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Stick it to them, Mr. President</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see you in 10 min, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour,  right after \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tax reform trickle down, Verizon, Disney,  Starbucks have all announced perks for their employees as a result of the  new tax cuts.  Joining me right now live from the World Economic Forum is  the CEO of Campbell Soup, Denise Morrison.  Denise, great to see you,  thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> DENISE MORRISON, CEO, CAMPBELL SOUP:  Hi, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the tax package?</p><p> MORRISON:  Well, I think the tax reform will be beneficial for business.   We at Campbell's are going to realize a benefit from the reduced rate being  largely United States company, we bear a rate over 30 percent and we  expected that will come down pretty significantly.  And what we're going to  do with that is invest in our brands and pay down debt because we just made  a very large acquisition.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about that acquisition.  How does this  acquisition fill in the whole that you were looking to do?  What -- how  does it give you a scale and tell us about the growth that you're expecting  as a result?</p><p> MORRISON.  Yes.  Well, we've been on a journey to transform Campbell's and  to transition our portfolio.  Soup is a very important category but we now  recognize that in order to deliver on the needs and wants of the next  generation of consumers, we wanted to diversify our portfolio in the  faster-growing spaces, and those spaces are health and well-being and  snacking.  And so, acquisitions were the key accelerator for that strategy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Lance, $50 a share in cash.  A lot of people talked about  this as really helping Snyder's-Lance -- helping the company fill in areas  because people are looking for healthier options, wellness.  Tell us about  it.</p><p> MORRISON:  We believe that this provides a snacking platform, a diversified  snacking platform because we already have Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's, and  Kelsen, so this adds more to the savory snacks in addition to the sweet  snacks.  And then if you start to think about our simple meals as  convenient mini meals, it's right on trend with what the consumer is doing  because, Maria, only 34 percent of consumers eat three square meals a day.   Over 90 percent are snacking five times a day, so this is right on trend. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  So, the soup category, is that slowing down?  I  know the last quarter, a lot of people were worried that it showed that  we're seeing a bit of a slowdown.</p><p> MORRISON:  Yes, there are pockets of growth in the soup category, for  example, we introduced a new Well Yes! Product that we co-created with  consumers, and that's targeted for the younger generation, all clean label  soups, so you can read every ingredient on the label, ingredients like  quinoa and kale, right on trend.  We also just closed on the acquisition of  Pacific Foods, which is a soup and broth and plant-based beverage company.   We're very excited about that company, and the growth rate of that brand is  really exciting.  So, we are starting to move into new spaces even within  the soup category.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got to change as consumer tastes change and people are  looking for healthier options like the kale and quinoa.</p><p> MORRISON:  It always starts with the consumer.  And if you keep your eye on  the consumer, they will take you where you need to go.  And we spend lots  of times with the consumers, we shop with them, we cook with them, we eat  with them.  Our team is having so much fun, sometimes it's hard to get them  to come back to work.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, growth comes from acquisitions or organic?</p><p> MORRISON:  Growth comes from both.  You need to be innovation -- you have  to have organic innovation and really push the thinking, you have to do  some acquisitions but you also have to --</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks for joining us, everybody, we'l1 see you tomorrow.   Here's Stuart and \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Stu?</p><p>VARNEY:  Thanks very much, Maria.  All right.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome back,  everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  It is  Wednesday, January 24th.  The top stories right now 8:00 A.M. on the East  Coast.  America First on the world stage.  President Trump and his  administration heads to Davos to tout the U.S. economy and lure big-name  investors to America.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin making headline  down the ground in Davos already.  The dollar is down this morning after  Secretary Mnuchin said a weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy.  He's  not the only cabinet member making headlines.  Earlier this morning, I  spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about the  delegation to the World Economic Forum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  I think  what this message is going to be is America First is not America alone.  We  need to partner, you know, as I said earlier, not one of us has the ability  to do this alone.  So we need to partner with the private secretary.  We  need to partner with our allies.  We've seen those discussions with North  Korea.  We've seen that in Syria.  We've seen that in Iran.  We have to  build coalitions to be able to attack these threats together and I think --  I think that's what you'll hear a lot about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president's trip to Davos comes amid another case of  trickle-down tax reform.  Starbucks, the latest company passing on savings  from the new tax law to its employees.  The announcement coming on the  heels of similar news from Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Verizon and that  was just yesterday.  What the coffee giant is brewing up for its records  coming up.  New and more records from markets, the NASDAQ yesterday surged  52 points after Netflix stock jumped 10 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 also added  all-time high this morning after another gain yesterday of 6 points quarter  of a percent higher.  The Dow pulled back yesterday but this morning we  look at momentum on the upside we're expecting a pretty strong opening for  the broader averages.  Take a look at Futures with the Dow Industrials now  at the highs of the morning.  We're expecting a gain of 80 points right out  of the gate a third of a percent higher, S&amp;P 500 also higher by a quarter  of a percent, and the NASDAQ adding on to yesterday's record performance.  </p><p>In Europe, this morning different story.  Take a look at the European  indices lower across the board worst performer in the U.K. FT-100 down one  half of one percent.  In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher with  the exception of Japan as you see the Nikkei averaging Japan down three- quarters of a percent overnight.  Earnings, the story on Wall Street once  again General Electric, Ford Motor, Comcast, all among the big names  reporting their fourth quarter numbers.  Comcast delivered a double beat  earnings and revenue above estimates.  General Electric missed estimates  but look at the stock, it's up one and one and a half percent.  Clearly,  investors are seeing some value in G.E. shares after a 40 percent sell-off  despite that miss on earnings.</p><p>Trouble patching the patch, well, Intel is still struggling to repair the  glaring flaw in its chips sparking new concerns this morning for  cybersecurity.  Plus, hackers cash in on the cryptocurrency craze.  The  stunning amount stolen from the billions raised in initial coin offerings  amid the Bitcoin boom.  We will tell you about that.  Also coming up this  morning, joining the conversation Energy Secretary Rick Perry is with us  this morning along with Dow CEO Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Cisco Chuck  Robbins is here, and the CEO of Campbell Soup Denise Morrison.  </p><p>Plus, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in.  You don't  want to miss the moments with them.  We got a big hour coming up.  First,  this top story this hour, America First on the world stage.  President  Trump headed to the World Economic Forum in Davos.  Tonight, he's expected  to arrive tomorrow.  Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin already on the  ground here in Switzerland and he's making news.  He had comments this  morning saying that he welcomes a weakening dollar because it is good for  trade.  That sent the dollar to fresh new lows this morning.  Though  Mnuchin also emphasized America is open for business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY:  We have a great  story to tell, lots of important meetings.  It's truly all about economic  growth opportunities to invest free and fair trade, and kind of -- so we're  looking forward to it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can do that.  If you don't want to, you don't have  to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's fine.  This is coming as companies here in U.S. are  giving back to their employees in the wake of the tax reform overhaul.   President Trump just tweeted this, this morning.  He says, tremendous  investment by companies from all over the world being made in America.   There has never been anything like it.  The president writes now, Disney,  JPMorgan Chase, and many others, massive regulation reduction tax cuts  making the U.S. a powerhouse once again.  He says, long way to go, jobs,  jobs, jobs.  Joining me now to weigh in is the Chairman and CEO of E.Y.,  Global Chairman and CEO Mark Weinberger.  Mark, it's great to see you.  </p><p>MARK WEINBERGER, GLOBAL CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF E.Y.:  Always a pleasure,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So I know that you have been  on panels this morning.  You're talking to a lot of your customers and  clients about what's taking place in the U.S. and the tax reform bill that  is having a really big impact.</p><p>WEINBERGER:  It is, Maria.  We're seeing, you know, obviously, it doesn't  make the U.S. a tax heaven but what it does do is give us a competitor rate  and it allows companies to move their capital around without having to pay  that extra level of tax.  We are seeing supply changed being reevaluated,  operations and investment being expanded and as you said, we're seeing a  whole bunch of things like increasing wages, bonuses, pension payments,  healthcare payments.  The real question is you know it has been are the  businesses going to give back to shareholders and stock buybacks and  dividends or investing in capital and labor?  I think you're going to see  all of that but it's a positive -- definitely a positive momentum here in  Davos.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And all of the above is positive?  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  All of the above are positive, gives back in the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But let me ask you this because we see this tax plan having an  immediate effect with the companies announcing these things, but this is  really going to have a longer-term effect, isn't it?</p><p>WEINBERGER:  That is a great point because everyone is saying, what's this  going to do next quarter?  This is a landmark tax reform bill that  structurally changes business taxes like we haven't even done since 1960s.   We talk about the 1986 Act.  That was a lot of individual changes.   International rules are written in the 60s.  This completely changes how a  company thinks about where to put his capital.  It's not just U.S.  businesses.  We're talking to many Asian companies, European companies, who  are looking to invest in the U.S. to get advantage of the full expensing,  the lower corporate rate, and a number of other benefits of just being a  great market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  I was speaking to a European player recently and  he said, we had a whole plan to invest in Europe.  We've shifted that plan  and now we'll be investing in America which is -- </p><p>WEINBERGER:  We'll see more of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is very positive.  All right.  There's that.  The  president and his administration getting high marks on the tax reform  package.  No doubt about it.  But then there's trade where there are some  questions.  The president yesterday announced steep tariffs on solar  panels, on washing machines while 11 Pacific Rim countries agreed to forge  a new commercial block that excludes the U.S., obviously, the U.S. pulling  out of the TPP, what's your take on what's happening with regards to trade?  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  So I think the speech is you and your league, you talked about  it's going to be really important because the president has to balance and  enforcing the laws.  I mean this, you know, putting tariffs on solar isn't,  you know, changing the whole landscape of trade, in fact, from 2012 and  2015, we had tariffs on solar.  So there are really uncertainty now is  where is he go next?  And we need to be involved in trade deals around the  world.  We can't be left out.  Ninety-five percent of the world's  consumers, 80 percent of GDP growth is outside the United States.  So  businesses want to be able to go there.  The U.S. is and open market.  We  let everybody in.  Trade deals are good for businesses.  In the U.S., they  create jobs.  So the question is going to be, does this lead to more and  more retaliation and trade wars?  Or is this enforcement of existing deals  and renegotiations of NAFTA or renegotiations of course, and discussions  with China to get to a positive trade deal?  That's what everyone is going  to be watching.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So one of the issues with NAFTA is it basically sets the  companies, look, you can have a factory overseas in Mexico and you can  produce cheap stuff and then you can send them back to the U.S. and sell  them in U.S., so of course, companies are going to do just that in higher  workers at a much lower wage in Mexico.  And then once NAFTA was completed  and then everybody started doing that, that became the template for all  trade deals?</p><p>WEINBERGER:  Well, it's true.  But if you think -- but there are so many  examples where you know, well, I mean how do you even implement as you  don't know what the cargo -- component parts going over and back across the  border in Canada six times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  And iPhone is 800 different companies worked on an iPhone in  31 different countries and the component parts all come together into the  United States, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are they going to do, pay a tariff every time they  cross --</p><p>WEINBERGER:  They couldn't do it.  You couldn't afford an iPhone if you had  a tariff every level of the company in the United States.  You couldn't get  the labor done if you try to bring it all back to the United States.  So we  need to understand that this helps the United States too to have these  trade deals in place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there's got to a balance between fair trade but also not  hurting the customer because ultimately that's going to fall on the  consumer who's going to pay more for a product because the company that  makes it is paying a tariff?  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  Absolutely.  It's like a tax here that we just reduced.  So  but you're in the nail in the head, Maria, as always.  The pivot we got to  watch and see right now from feeding up on our trading partners.  First, a  lot of bad deals and upgrading necessarily trade deals to starting to  negotiating positively the new deals.  Seeing if NAFTA will get done this  year.  We have a lot of negotiations coming up this month, of course, the  Mexican elections coming up on midterms and coming up makes it hard.   Mercosur is positively moving forward, so we're going to try and negotiate  that.  We got to make progress in those deals and that will set a good  signal. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you, Mark.  And turn to -- turn to Bitcoin  because according to new research, you and Ernst &amp; Young did recently more  than 10 percent of funds raised through initial coin offerings are lost or  stolen in hacker attacks?  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  Yes.  Well, this is -- as we know, it's a really complicated  area and, you know, these coin offerings are plenty.  There's over a  hundred different indexes out there where they're coming in there's  offerings.  They are obviously susceptible to fraud and theft.  They become  more of an investment than a currency and so I think appropriately you have  the government to look at it where we point it out there is that investors  -- it's not an investor.  It's really a tool to be a currency.  You have to  be cautious how you're investing in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One more risk to watch around Bitcoin?  </p><p>WEINBERGER:  Always, a lot more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark, great to see you.</p><p>WEINBERGER:  Always, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning, Mark Weinberger  or EY.  Coming up, General Electric releases its 4th quarter results  missing earnings and revenue expectations.  We'll break those numbers.   Nonetheless, the stock is up 1-1/2 percent.  And then more concerns over  cybersecurity, Intel is telling customers to stop installing a software  patch release to address a security flaw in their computer chips.  We've  got the details next.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are live this week at the World Economic  Forum here in Davos, Switzerland.  President Trump will be here tomorrow.   Joining me right now and a first time Fox Business interview DowDuPont  Executive Chairman, CEO Andrew Liveris who is also the head of the now  disbanded president -- Americans Manufacturing Council.  Good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No.  We're coming into this meeting there was a lot of  optimism.  But would you say that this is one of the most optimistic Davos  meetings you've ever seen? </p><p>LIVERIS:  Definitely one of the most optimistic and also one full of  expectation for the president visit here on Friday.  So really the topic is  the president's visit.  So most of us are getting all of that meetings done  before tomorrow because I think it's going to tilt very quickly to what the  president is going to say and kind of his team is kind of coming in already  with meeting some of them.  I had a couple of meetings today with U.S.  officials.  I've never seen such a strong U.S. delegation.  So this is kind  of opposite to America First thing.  I mean this is America engaged and as  a global company, this is a positive thing.  And I think my European  colleagues and the rest of the world colleagues Asian, Middle East, Africa,  they're all kind of waiting to see how the U.S. will posture itself.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really good way to put it American engaged, I like  that.  How is the president doing in your view?  I know that, you know, you  were on that council.  You were the chairman.  It was disbanded.  There was  upset at that time, but how would you grade President Trump's by now?  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, from a year ago to present day even through the year with  the disbanding of the council, I've been very consistent on that answer.   This is a very business-friendly president, very business friendly  administration, so I give him a strong A.  I mean, you know, the tax reform  you just talked about I mean but not just tax reform, the regulatory work  is being done.  It's astonishing.  I've never imagined that much progress  in 12 months or so and of course other work that I'm involved in which I'm  on secretary of (INAUDIBLE) workforce reinvention counsel.  This is the  apprenticeship task force which is to redefine what the American system is  producing in terms of skilled workers with digitalization approaching us.   I'm very encouraged by that work and that early stuff that we're doing to  change the way America supplies workers we need and so I'm very -- I give - - I give it a strong A.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's very important because we're seeing machine learning take  over jobs and we're seeing new skillsets really required.  OK.  So positive  marks on the tax reform package.  We know that.  We know what's going on  but all of these companies coming out and saying how positive it is, but  we're also seeing a debate around the trade story and that's I want to get  your take on because the president issued new tariffs on imports of solar  panels and washing machines from Asia, what do you make of this?  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, so, you know, now that -- you just said tax reform  happening and let's skip the details of that finalized.  But trade is of  course on his agenda and the business agenda are topic he ran for office on  and there's a lot of work to be done whether it be the redoing of NAFTA and  whatever form it takes, the China discussion, and of course, all the things  that the president worries about which is giving Americans jobs that they  can count on for the future.  You just mentioned machine learning and  digitalization.  We all know that's as big a potential job killer as  anything in the trade agenda.  So we've got all to engage our workers.   We've got to engage the American public to actually put the facts in front  of the table of what is the trade topic.  And it isn't -- look at Dow, I  mean I export from the United States to all countries of the world.  </p><p>One in five of my jobs is based on America being a trader, so we got to  keep trade.  But what the president is doing is he wants to change the  rules of engagement.  And I think we all have to engage in that topic, so  what are these rules?  OK.  It isn't just about putting tariffs on and on  that tariff question, I mean we Dow make a polysilicon.  That's a -- the  raw material for solar panels.  We've been excluded from the China market  for the last five years, so that's not far.  So these tariffs on solar  panels is a way of sending a signal that it can't be one way.  It can't be  one-way trade and I support the president on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is really important because you've actually seen firsthand  the impact of much cheaper products coming from China.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Absolutely.  And then, so American workers, we can't -- we are  now having plants at risks, factories at risks because I can't access the  China market and they favor their own producers, yet the solar panels are  being -- coming over here and killing our solar panel industry in the  United States.  So there needs to be a recalibration with lots of  conversation with Secretary Ross in the USTR on this topic.  So that's an  example of recalibrating the rules of trade and I'm all for that, but I  think we need to get the facts on the table, get the rhetoric out of room,  and, you know, what are these rules of engagement in terms of fair trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is the first explanation that really I've heard that make  so much sense because you're right there and you're feeling it firsthand.   The worry is of course, are we going to see retaliation?  I mean are you  going to China even get more secluded and even more protectionist in terms  of their solar panels?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, since antiquity and city-states, and bartering view, of  course, get tit-for-tat.  You, of course, get retaliation.  This is what  negotiation is.  This president is a negotiator.  We have a team of  negotiations in the U.S. side.  I'm a businessperson.  I'm going  negotiator.  As long as we end up at the right spot, I think the rhetoric  and the retaliation may will be part of the process.  I'm convinced based  on speed of tax reform and the speed of regulatory reform, this will not be  one of these things that takes a lot of time.  So I would encourage all my  colleagues certainly our company to be engaged, to be at the table on what  these tit-for-tats will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think we're going to see more of this like for example  as it relates to aluminum and steel because the president did say -- he  mentioned aluminum and steel and I think that is getting some people  nervous that we're going to see more and more of this kind of tariff  behavior and it's --</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, I'm not in -- I'm not in the room that decides which ones  but I am telling you, if I look at chemicals, for example, we have a  surplus.  We're the second largest exporter from the United States.  So we  would hate to see if steel and aluminum thing happen and then chemicals,  you know, give restrictions in terms of exporting from the United States  into China or any other country, so I would be counter doing too much tit- for-tat.  But I think this recent one is a strong enough message that the  United States is serious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  And you've given us phenomenal insight into  this.  Andrew, thank you for that.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Not at all.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are such a retire as Chairman of DowDuPont later this year  after overseeing its historic deal the merger late last year.  Now, I know  you are reporting earnings.  You're going to be giving us guidelines on all  of this in the coming week.  But what can you tell us in terms of the  timing of integration?  What do you want to say to shareholders in terms of  where you are today?  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, I think our shareholders from our last report to present  day what I'll say and then what I'll say next week with specificity.  This  is on track.  As you said, it's historic, 300 years of corporate history  and to reconfigure these assets in a tax-free way pushing in a hold value  for growth, for three companies, the new Dow which will be the materials  company, the new agricultural company, the new specialty company.  We're on  track.  And look, I can't be happier about the way the cultures of being  assimilating, the integration work.  We've got thousands of people working  on this, not to mention all the help in the consultants' world that you can  find.  It's working and I would tell you that you right now and you'll hear  more next week that it's basically on track.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then in terms of growth look at five years, where does the  growth come from at this company?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well, I got to tell you that the humanity and sustainability  which gets talked about here a lot.  We need products that have full  circulation capability.  So all that work on light-weighting on batteries  and cars, on the next car what that looks like.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Good packaging, what we do with food packaging, what we do with  plastics in the ocean, what we do with carbon emissions, these are all  opportunities for these companies would it be the agricultural one or the  materials one, or the specialty ones, water, and water reuse, waste  management, waste reuse, these are the opportunities that we're addressing  through using out 7500 scientists.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this is where the growth comes from?  </p><p>LIVERIS:  That's where it comes from.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about regulation.  Obviously, this president has  been rolling back regulations, have you felt it in your sector because I  know other sectors they're not there yet and it sort of the smaller runway,  what have you seen?  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Look, I can't speak strongly enough about how much we've felt it.   It's not just -- it's not just the attitude.  It's being specific and we've  been asked, and it's kind of nice to be consulted to be at the front end of  this, to use science, to say this regulation makes sense.  This one  doesn't.  This administration has been unafraid to roll back regulations  that make no sense.  We felt it.  We're feeling it on our bottom line.  But  more importantly, we're seeing it in a change in attitude on what's the  smarter regulation.  We are for regulation.  We just want the right type of  regulation to actually manage the behaviors of everyone in the value chain.   We're a big player.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the pendulum just swung way too far.  Andrew, it's great to  see you.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Always going to be with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Andrew Liveris there.  We'll be right back.   Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live this week from the  World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Speaking with the biggest  names in business and innovation, cybersecurity, of course, one of the  agenda topics here as companies like Intel are asking their companies and  their customers to stop installing a software patch that it released to fix  security flaws on computer chips.  The company says that the patch is can  cause, \"Unpredictable system behavior.\"  Joining me right now to weigh in  on that is the CEO of Cisco Chuck Robbins.  Chuck, it's great to see you.  </p><p>CHUCK ROBBINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CISCO SYSTEMS:  Great to see you,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I want to talk broadly about what's happening in your  business right now.  But how are you combating the cybersecurity  vulnerability like this one?  </p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, first of all, I think Intel is doing a reasonable job.   It's obviously a significant issue.  In the industry, we all try to come  together when we have these kinds of issues occur and there's a great  cooperative spirit between the major tech companies when we find these  types of issues and we're working through it within just like everybody is,  and I think they're doing the right things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can you tell us about I.T. budgets today, Chuck?  I mean  here we are looking at an environment where people are talking about four  percent economic growth.  Your business is the gut to any other business in  a whole host of sectors.  So I want to ask you what you're seeing in terms  of I.T. budgets.  Are managers spending more on your products?</p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, it's early in the year and every year when we start the new  calendar year budgets begin to become more visible as we get into it.  And  we're in the latter part of our quarter now and so we'll be reporting  earnings in a couple weeks and we'll give some insights into that.  But I  think that when you look at what happened here in the country and you look  at tax reform, and you look at the positive feeling here in Davos that you  have at least from an economic perspective, I think that there's a great  deal of optimism around the world right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There really is.  What do you think is powering it?   Because I think from your standpoint it's more than just tax reform, isn't  it?</p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, it is.  And if you look at the economic situation around  the world, it's -- I mean the central banks have done a great job.  You've  got stimulus has been put into the system.  You have had a great, you know,  since the 2008 crisis, we've had a -- we've finally got into a sustained  recovery and now what you see happening that with our business is that as  we've seen here in Davos if you go back three or four years, we were  talking about the internet of things and now the fourth industrial  revolution, and there's no doubt that that's occurring, and no one is  talking about it.  So here we're having conversations about how do we  redefine the architecture inside a vehicle.  Those are the conversations  we're having now.  So technology is permeating every aspect of life and  industry, and as that happens as billions of things become connected.   Obviously, that's good for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about that because we were talking with Carlo  Stone yesterday and he was saying, everything in a car today is technology  related.  So what areas of business are the most important in terms of  powering your business?  What sectors?</p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, if you look at -- it's happening across every industry  today.  Primarily, we have seen early adoption in manufacturing of this  industrial internet.  We've seen retail move.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sorry about that.  </p><p>ROBBINS:  That's great.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This must mean someone important is arriving.  </p><p>ROBBINS:  I know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because a helicopter is here making lots of noise but hopefully  they just passed.  So you said manufacturing -- </p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, I just want you to know when I arrived in Davos, I wouldn't  interrupt you like that visitor, you know, we've seen manufacturing.  We've  seen healthcare.  We see connected cars.  We made announcements of CES with  Hyundai.  I meet with a couple of car manufacturers here this week about  what we can do together and then across our broader business just the  connectivity of all these devices, the management of the data, the  cybersecurity issues that are associated with it.  They all provide great  opportunities for us in the future.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because everything is connected today, so tell us how the  Cisco products connect?  </p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, so I think they're circling to come back to see if they --  make sure you heard them the first time.  So when you -- when you look at  the connectivity of all of the platforms, the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stop.  Just give it a minute first.  It's going back at out,  yes.  </p><p>ROBBINS:  It's (INAUDIBLE) they're going to land right here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're right above us.  </p><p>ROBBINS:  They're going to land.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This helicopter.  </p><p>ROBBINS:  The matter of the issue is as we connect vehicles, as we connect  vending machines, manufacturing facilities whatever they are, Cisco is the  largest machine, the machine connectivity platform.  Then after that, you  have to actually take the data that's created and help our customers move  that data to the place that they need it and whether it's in a public  crowd, whether it's in a private cloud, or whether they want to assess and  manage that data at the edge of the network, the network is going to play a  great role, and then we fundamentally have to drive security in the network  because there is no perimeter to defend it anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wonderful.  Chuck, I'm so sorry.</p><p>ROBBINS:  What did you say?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is -- this is incredible.  We're having a conversation --</p><p>ROBBINS:  We had a funny experienced last year too, you know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But with the helicopters? </p><p>ROBBINS:  No.  We had one with a camera last year, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's right.  Let me ask you real quick in terms of  geography and where you see the best growth right now.  Europe is growing.   The U.S. is obviously a chunk of a four percent growth, is there a corner  of the world that is doing better than others with regard to this kind of  activity?</p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, what I would say is that we see probably more consistent  growth around the world than we've seen in a very long time as evidence by  the discussions going on here.  When we look at the adoption of the  technology, we see emerging countries adopting the technology to try to  solve problems in a massive scale whether it's in India, whether it's in  China.  And then we see obviously developed countries leveraging these  technologies to look at how we make cities smarter that had optimized  traffic and optimized citizen services, so it's really happening  everywhere, it's amazing.  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Incredible performance.  So how do you keep this going?</p><p>ROBBINS:  Well, I think that as long as this industrial revolution  continues then we should be at the heart of all of that because as our  customers connect more and more devices, the network is absolutely the  foundation, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chuck, it's good to have you on the show.  Thank you so much.   This is great, this is incredible.  This is actually funny.</p><p>ROBBINS:  They're circling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're circling.  Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, we will be right  back.  Thank you so much.</p><p>LEIF SHIRAS, TENNIS CHANNEL COMMENTATOR: Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel Court Report, a special presentation For Business.  I'm Leif  Shairs.  Well, the 2018 Austrian Open completed quarterfinal action on day  10 in Melbourne and there was American interest in both the man and woman  draws.  Kyung Chang ended the dream run of Tennessee native Tenny Sandgren  to reach the final four and become the first South Korean to reach the  semifinals at a major.</p><p>Elsewhere, Angelique Kerber made short work of Maidson Keys in their  quarterfinal.  The American never found her game as the German powered away  to an impressive one and two victory.  Don't forget, Tennis Channel's live  coverage of the Australian Open continues Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern.   I'm Leif Sharis.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic  Forum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, January  24th.  Your top stories right now 8:34 on the East Coast.  The White House  descends on Davos.  President Trump set to leave Washington for the World  Economic Forum tonight.  The trip comes as the White House makes good on  the Commander-in-Chief's promise to put America first, this follows the  overwhelming success of the President's tax plan. </p><p>Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin already on the ground and he is making  news, the dollar is sliding this morning after Secretary Mnuchin said a  weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy and trade during a press  conference in Davos.  Markets this morning are rallying, take a look at the  futures indicating that we will see a higher opening for the broader  averages.  This right here is the high of the morning.  Up better than 100  points in unchartered territory once again. S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ also in  unchartered territory.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P hit new record-highs  yesterday.  </p><p>Ahead of the President's trip, investors are watching earning this morning  from the likes of General Electric and Comcast among others.  G.E. reported  earnings and revenue which were below expectation and yet the stock is  trading higher.  The stock up 2-1/2 percent as investors look for value  after a huge selloff.  Comcast also topped expectations although that stock  is lower.  European indices this morning are lower.  The stocks in Europe,  take a look, are weaker across the board pretty much.  FT-100 down one-half  of a half percent, the CAC quarante and DAX are also lower.  In Asia  overnight, markets close mostly higher, take a look.  And as you see, the  markets were higher with the exception of Japan which was down three- quarters of one percent.</p><p>Topping our news this half an hour, President Trump and America First at  Davos.  More than a dozen high-level members of the administration are  arriving here to discuss economics, trade, cybersecurity and a lot more  with the political and corporate leaders gathers here.  Joining me right  now is the United States Secretary of Energy, Secretary Rick Perry.   Secretary, it's great to see you.</p><p>RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  The President's America  First message, how do you think it will be received?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, I think he have to understand what America First means to the  President and the administration.  It's really pretty simple from my  perspective.  This is about America being competitive around the globe.   When folks were thinking about where you want to buy your energy from,  where do you want that next load of LNG to come from?  We want you to think  about America first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good way to put it.  Well, the President has  stressed really tapping into our oil reserves in America.  Let's talk about  that and where the opportunities are from your standpoint.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  Well, you think about 10 plus years ago and then 2005 we were  -- besides ourselves, if you will and behind, other places where the oil  and gas was coming from, you know, we had founded all, Peak oil.  We heard  all of those stories and then, you know, by the grace of God and some  technology and a god by named George Mitchell from Texas, hydraulic  fracturing came into play in a really big way and we were able to go into  those tight shell formations and develop that which is now creating an  absolute revolution in the oil and gas industry and completely changing the  geopolitical dynamics in the world with America being at the forefront.  We  are now the number one oil and gas producing nation on the face of the  earth.  I mean, who would have thought that a decade ago that that would  have been true.  But it puts us in a very unique place.  And here is what I  try to share with all of our allies and for all the audience here at Davos  is that the United States is not just exporting energy, we're exporting  freedom.  We're exporting to our allies in Europe.  The opportunity to  truly have a choice of where do you buy your energy from.  That's freedom,  and that kind of freedom is priceless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you're making because for  a long time America was reliant on places like Saudi Arabia and Russia to  get energy but today it's a completely different situation in America.  How  significant is it?  I mean, how would you characterize the supply that will  be coming from the U.S. or to the global markets.</p><p>PERRY:  You know, I'm not sure anything since World War II has been anymore  dynamic from my perspective than they shift in the energy supply, energy  control if you will.  And again, the United States in the back controlling  a country with this industry.  It's about literally freeing up our allies  around the world.  Letting them know that we're going to be there for them,  there's no strings attached when you buy American LNG.  So, that is --  that's world-changing.  And truly, this president, that's his message here.   Is that the United States is -- it's a new day.  The fossil fuels that  we're going to be relying them on for decades to come are going to be  available.  Now, is our technology going to be able to allow us to use it  wiser?  With better results for the environment?  Absolutely.  The CCCU,  the carbon capture utilization, we're doing projects with Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>I'll see my counterpart (INAUDIBLE) today on a panel, we'll talk about the  projects that we're working on together.  The UAE, Qatar, all of those  countries as we come together to develop and supply the rest of the world  with the power so that they can have manufacturing (INAUDIBLE) in Africa.   Being able to, you know, literally turn the lights on when the sun goes  down so that their children can read, the people are safer.  I mean, all of  that is partly because of American ingenuity and our abilities to not  believe the naysayers that people is here and you're not going to find any  more of this</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is there -- is there a way to characterize the amount of  supply that will be coming from the U.S.?</p><p>PERRY:  Well, you know, I hesitate to be a forecaster of what the home  markets are going to be.  I'll leave that up to people that are  substantially more into that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  You're the Energy Secretary.  Let me ask --</p><p>PERRY:  My job is to make sure that it's -- the abundant supply and I want  to get people together so that they know that America is going to be a  reliant supplier of that energy.  The price will work itself though.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised where prices are by the way because it feels  like the markets are focused more on the potential for terrorism or  disruption.  Where oil is right now.  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, those are realities of the world.  But the fact is that we  have an amazing I mean, you think about Anwar that the Congress just opened  up again.  You know, the previous administration closed it down, Congress  working with the administration said, you know what, those nine million  barrels are really important to the United States and to the world.  So  opening up markets that the previous administration have closed.  I think  it's in a very powerful message around the world that we're going to be a  reliant supplier of energy into the foreseeable future.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  And I think that's why there's change happening in  Saudi Arabia.</p><p>PERRY:  Indeed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There is incredible change happening in other countries because  they see what to expect from the U.S.  By the way, what was behind the  decision not to drill off of the coast of Florida?  </p><p>PERRY:  You know, I think that the administration through the Department of  Interior sensitive to the issues there.  There is plenty of space out there  whether it's in the gulf, whether it's in Anwar, whether it's other areas  that we can develop the energy resource we have.  You know, the people of  Florida said, hey listen, we don't want to add any new drilling platforms,  the administration respected that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was OK with the (INAUDIBLE) let me ask you about the  President's news this week and that is these tariffs on solar panels and on  washing machines, there is some conversation happening and as you know  about worries about potential trade wars, about what China will do in  response.  Should we worry about a different trade stance from this  administration?  </p><p>PERRY:  They shouldn't be worrying about this administration from the  standpoint of transparency and fairness.  That's what Donald Trump is all  about.  You want to compete against the United States, bring it but don't  subsidize in a way that it's unfair, don't get into the market and try to  gobble up all the market and then all of a sudden after you choked  everybody else out of market, guess what, prices go up.  This is a  president that says, look, I get it about competition.  But you're going to  compete fairly, and you're going to compete on a level-playing field.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the President said that as it relates to jobs as well and  when you look at the energy story, that's a real job creator.  Can you  characterize what we might see from all of the drilling and the fracturing  that will happen in terms of job creation?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, it's going to continue on.  I mean, that's obviously for the  states that --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And consistent.  </p><p>PERRY:  And it's not just the jobs right in those states where it's  happening, it's upstream or excuse me, it's downstream from that.  It's the  manufacturing.  We think there is an incredible potential in the  Appalachian region to turn that area into an absolute job-creating giant  with the development of the Marcell or Shell with the other fossil fuels  that are available there.  You can duplicate the footprint of what you see  along in Texas Gulf Coast in that Appalachian region and the jobs that get  created.  I'm promising you the governor of West Virginia and Ohio and  Kentucky and Pennsylvania, they're going to be staying and they're saluting  and saying, Mr. President, let's go, let's go make this happen, let's go  make America great again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they're -- and these are high-paying jobs.  </p><p>PERRY:  Indeed.  They are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you like the job?  How do you like the role of energy  secretary?  What's new that you can tell us with this?</p><p>PERRY:  Most interesting job I've ever had.  Best job ever had was governor  of Texas but this one is the most interesting and the coolest job mostly  because of the 17 national labs that are out there involved in everything  from cybersecurity to the next wave of small-moderate reactors to, you  know, just the most fascinating new things that are going to be on the  horizon for America.  Our national labs are involved in. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, thank you for your leadership.  </p><p>PERRY:  You're welcome.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Secretary Rick Perry.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Electric reported earnings that were  below expectations, this morning.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the  New York Stock Exchange watching the stock trade up -- Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  We know that  General Electric has been in a turnaround phase.  In the last August,  Flannery came on as the new CEO to turn this thing around.  Today, look at  that, just in the last half hour, you -- a short time ago, we're saying it  was up 2-1/2 percent.  And look now, it's up 5.2 percent.  So, what  happened here?  We did see ultimately, that the company in the latest  quarter, they're really focusing on the overall -- the restructuring plan.   The weakness that they've seen in operating profit and the revenue but  ultimately that they're focusing on the aviation and health care divisions  where they are seeing some strength.  </p><p>There has been talk about this company being beaten down, and don't forget,  it's down about 45 percent in the last 12 months.  Is now the time to  finally get into General Electric?  I know you've had this conversation  with many of your guests, but there's been talk of dividing up the company  in some way.  But that the turnaround and restructuring is underway, but  you are seeing the stock now getting a big jump, Maria.  Now, it's up 5-1/2  percent at 17.78.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you, Nicole.  From Disney to Verizon and  Starbucks, more U.S. companies handing out bonus checks, hiking wages for  their workers after the tax reform overhaul.  Joining me right now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Stu, it's  just incredible the number of companies.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, it's a flood.  Look, I  would call it a flood.  Look, in the last 24 hours, we've got Disney, a  thousand bucks to 125,000 employees, Verizon, I think is 2,500 bucks worth  of stock to the employees; J.P. Morgan 10 percent wage increases for a big  swath of their people.  I mean, it's a long list, just in last 24 hours.   It's clear, I think American business was on trial, they got everything  they wanted from the tax cut deal, and now, they are indeed passing it  along to the -- to the customers and also to their employees.  But, you  know, the big pass-through, I think, is still to come.  I think that will  come from the big tech companies of this world, when they repatriate all of  that money.  I think a lot of it goes to shareholders.  And looking for  stock buybacks like Comcast, for example, and I'm looking also for a  dividend increases.  That's the next round in this flood of pass-throughs  and givebacks.  Here it comes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a great point.  I would also add on to financial  services, Stu, because, you know, the banks really haven't even had the  actual impact of regulation rollback.  You know,  that's to come, so  there's this enormous runway there as well.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, look, it's a flood, that's what I'm saying.  By the way, how  is Davos treating you?  Are being nice to you?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's good.  I mean, you know, everyone's talking about  President Trump.</p><p>VARNEY:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming tomorrow, and wondering what he's going to say, so he's  definitely making a splash even before he arrives, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Stick it to them, Mr. President</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you in 10 min, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour,  right after \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tax reform trickle down, Verizon, Disney,  Starbucks have all announced perks for their employees as a result of the  new tax cuts.  Joining me right now live from the World Economic Forum is  the CEO of Campbell Soup, Denise Morrison.  Denise, great to see you,  thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DENISE MORRISON, CEO, CAMPBELL SOUP:  Hi, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the tax package?</p><p>MORRISON:  Well, I think the tax reform will be beneficial for business.   We at Campbell's are going to realize a benefit from the reduced rate being  largely United States company, we bear a rate over 30 percent and we  expected that will come down pretty significantly.  And what we're going to  do with that is invest in our brands and pay down debt because we just made  a very large acquisition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about that acquisition.  How does this  acquisition fill in the whole that you were looking to do?  What -- how  does it give you a scale and tell us about the growth that you're expecting  as a result?</p><p>MORRISON.  Yes.  Well, we've been on a journey to transform Campbell's and  to transition our portfolio.  Soup is a very important category but we now  recognize that in order to deliver on the needs and wants of the next  generation of consumers, we wanted to diversify our portfolio in the  faster-growing spaces, and those spaces are health and well-being and  snacking.  And so, acquisitions were the key accelerator for that strategy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Lance, $50 a share in cash.  A lot of people talked about  this as really helping Snyder's-Lance -- helping the company fill in areas  because people are looking for healthier options, wellness.  Tell us about  it.</p><p>MORRISON:  We believe that this provides a snacking platform, a diversified  snacking platform because we already have Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's, and  Kelsen, so this adds more to the savory snacks in addition to the sweet  snacks.  And then if you start to think about our simple meals as  convenient mini meals, it's right on trend with what the consumer is doing  because, Maria, only 34 percent of consumers eat three square meals a day.   Over 90 percent are snacking five times a day, so this is right on trend. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  So, the soup category, is that slowing down?  I  know the last quarter, a lot of people were worried that it showed that  we're seeing a bit of a slowdown.</p><p>MORRISON:  Yes, there are pockets of growth in the soup category, for  example, we introduced a new Well Yes! Product that we co-created with  consumers, and that's targeted for the younger generation, all clean label  soups, so you can read every ingredient on the label, ingredients like  quinoa and kale, right on trend.  We also just closed on the acquisition of  Pacific Foods, which is a soup and broth and plant-based beverage company.   We're very excited about that company, and the growth rate of that brand is  really exciting.  So, we are starting to move into new spaces even within  the soup category.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got to change as consumer tastes change and people are  looking for healthier options like the kale and quinoa.</p><p>MORRISON:  It always starts with the consumer.  And if you keep your eye on  the consumer, they will take you where you need to go.  And we spend lots  of times with the consumers, we shop with them, we cook with them, we eat  with them.  Our team is having so much fun, sometimes it's hard to get them  to come back to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, growth comes from acquisitions or organic?</p><p>MORRISON:  Growth comes from both.  You need to be innovation -- you have  to have organic innovation and really push the thinking, you have to do  some acquisitions but you also have to --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for joining us, everybody, we'l1 see you tomorrow.   Here's Stuart and \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Stu?</p><p>VARNEY:  Thanks very much, Maria.  All right.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome back, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. It is Wednesday, January 24th. The top stories right now 8:00 A.M. on the East Coast. America First on the world stage. President Trump and his administration heads to Davos to tout the U.S. economy and lure big-name investors to America. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin making headline down the ground in Davos already. The dollar is down this morning after Secretary Mnuchin said a weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy. He's not the only cabinet member making headlines. Earlier this morning, I spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about the delegation to the World Economic Forum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: I think what this message is going to be is America First is not America alone. We need to partner, you know, as I said earlier, not one of us has the ability to do this alone. So we need to partner with the private secretary. We need to partner with our allies. We've seen those discussions with North Korea. We've seen that in Syria. We've seen that in Iran. We have to build coalitions to be able to attack these threats together and I think -- I think that's what you'll hear a lot about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The president's trip to Davos comes amid another case of trickle-down tax reform. Starbucks, the latest company passing on savings from the new tax law to its employees. The announcement coming on the heels of similar news from Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Verizon and that was just yesterday. What the coffee giant is brewing up for its records coming up. New and more records from markets, the NASDAQ yesterday surged 52 points after Netflix stock jumped 10 percent. The S&amp;P 500 also added all-time high this morning after another gain yesterday of 6 points quarter of a percent higher. The Dow pulled back yesterday but this morning we look at momentum on the upside we're expecting a pretty strong opening for the broader averages. Take a look at Futures with the Dow Industrials now at the highs of the morning. We're expecting a gain of 80 points right out of the gate a third of a percent higher, S&amp;P 500 also higher by a quarter of a percent, and the NASDAQ adding on to yesterday's record performance.</p><p>In Europe, this morning different story. Take a look at the European indices lower across the board worst performer in the U.K. FT-100 down one half of one percent. In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher with the exception of Japan as you see the Nikkei averaging Japan down three- quarters of a percent overnight. Earnings, the story on Wall Street once again General Electric, Ford Motor, Comcast, all among the big names reporting their fourth quarter numbers. Comcast delivered a double beat earnings and revenue above estimates. General Electric missed estimates but look at the stock, it's up one and one and a half percent. Clearly, investors are seeing some value in G.E. shares after a 40 percent sell-off despite that miss on earnings.</p><p>Trouble patching the patch, well, Intel is still struggling to repair the glaring flaw in its chips sparking new concerns this morning for cybersecurity. Plus, hackers cash in on the cryptocurrency craze. The stunning amount stolen from the billions raised in initial coin offerings amid the Bitcoin boom. We will tell you about that. Also coming up this morning, joining the conversation Energy Secretary Rick Perry is with us this morning along with Dow CEO Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Cisco Chuck Robbins is here, and the CEO of Campbell Soup Denise Morrison.</p><p>Plus, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in. You don't want to miss the moments with them. We got a big hour coming up. First, this top story this hour, America First on the world stage. President Trump headed to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Tonight, he's expected to arrive tomorrow. Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin already on the ground here in Switzerland and he's making news. He had comments this morning saying that he welcomes a weakening dollar because it is good for trade. That sent the dollar to fresh new lows this morning. Though Mnuchin also emphasized America is open for business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: We have a great story to tell, lots of important meetings. It's truly all about economic growth opportunities to invest free and fair trade, and kind of -- so we're looking forward to it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can do that. If you don't want to, you don't have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's fine. This is coming as companies here in U.S. are giving back to their employees in the wake of the tax reform overhaul. President Trump just tweeted this, this morning. He says, tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. The president writes now, Disney, JPMorgan Chase, and many others, massive regulation reduction tax cuts making the U.S. a powerhouse once again. He says, long way to go, jobs, jobs, jobs. Joining me now to weigh in is the Chairman and CEO of E.Y., Global Chairman and CEO Mark Weinberger. Mark, it's great to see you.</p><p>MARK WEINBERGER, GLOBAL CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF E.Y.: Always a pleasure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So I know that you have been on panels this morning. You're talking to a lot of your customers and clients about what's taking place in the U.S. and the tax reform bill that is having a really big impact.</p><p>WEINBERGER: It is, Maria. We're seeing, you know, obviously, it doesn't make the U.S. a tax heaven but what it does do is give us a competitor rate and it allows companies to move their capital around without having to pay that extra level of tax. We are seeing supply changed being reevaluated, operations and investment being expanded and as you said, we're seeing a whole bunch of things like increasing wages, bonuses, pension payments, healthcare payments. The real question is you know it has been are the businesses going to give back to shareholders and stock buybacks and dividends or investing in capital and labor? I think you're going to see all of that but it's a positive -- definitely a positive momentum here in Davos.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And all of the above is positive?</p><p>WEINBERGER: All of the above are positive, gives back in the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But let me ask you this because we see this tax plan having an immediate effect with the companies announcing these things, but this is really going to have a longer-term effect, isn't it?</p><p>WEINBERGER: That is a great point because everyone is saying, what's this going to do next quarter? This is a landmark tax reform bill that structurally changes business taxes like we haven't even done since 1960s. We talk about the 1986 Act. That was a lot of individual changes. International rules are written in the 60s. This completely changes how a company thinks about where to put his capital. It's not just U.S. businesses. We're talking to many Asian companies, European companies, who are looking to invest in the U.S. to get advantage of the full expensing, the lower corporate rate, and a number of other benefits of just being a great market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. I was speaking to a European player recently and he said, we had a whole plan to invest in Europe. We've shifted that plan and now we'll be investing in America which is --</p><p>WEINBERGER: We'll see more of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is very positive. All right. There's that. The president and his administration getting high marks on the tax reform package. No doubt about it. But then there's trade where there are some questions. The president yesterday announced steep tariffs on solar panels, on washing machines while 11 Pacific Rim countries agreed to forge a new commercial block that excludes the U.S., obviously, the U.S. pulling out of the TPP, what's your take on what's happening with regards to trade?</p><p>WEINBERGER: So I think the speech is you and your league, you talked about it's going to be really important because the president has to balance and enforcing the laws. I mean this, you know, putting tariffs on solar isn't, you know, changing the whole landscape of trade, in fact, from 2012 and 2015, we had tariffs on solar. So there are really uncertainty now is where is he go next? And we need to be involved in trade deals around the world. We can't be left out. Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers, 80 percent of GDP growth is outside the United States. So businesses want to be able to go there. The U.S. is and open market. We let everybody in. Trade deals are good for businesses. In the U.S., they create jobs. So the question is going to be, does this lead to more and more retaliation and trade wars? Or is this enforcement of existing deals and renegotiations of NAFTA or renegotiations of course, and discussions with China to get to a positive trade deal? That's what everyone is going to be watching.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So one of the issues with NAFTA is it basically sets the companies, look, you can have a factory overseas in Mexico and you can produce cheap stuff and then you can send them back to the U.S. and sell them in U.S., so of course, companies are going to do just that in higher workers at a much lower wage in Mexico. And then once NAFTA was completed and then everybody started doing that, that became the template for all trade deals?</p><p>WEINBERGER: Well, it's true. But if you think -- but there are so many examples where you know, well, I mean how do you even implement as you don't know what the cargo -- component parts going over and back across the border in Canada six times.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point.</p><p>WEINBERGER: And iPhone is 800 different companies worked on an iPhone in 31 different countries and the component parts all come together into the United States, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what are they going to do, pay a tariff every time they cross --</p><p>WEINBERGER: They couldn't do it. You couldn't afford an iPhone if you had a tariff every level of the company in the United States. You couldn't get the labor done if you try to bring it all back to the United States. So we need to understand that this helps the United States too to have these trade deals in place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So there's got to a balance between fair trade but also not hurting the customer because ultimately that's going to fall on the consumer who's going to pay more for a product because the company that makes it is paying a tariff?</p><p>WEINBERGER: Absolutely. It's like a tax here that we just reduced. So but you're in the nail in the head, Maria, as always. The pivot we got to watch and see right now from feeding up on our trading partners. First, a lot of bad deals and upgrading necessarily trade deals to starting to negotiating positively the new deals. Seeing if NAFTA will get done this year. We have a lot of negotiations coming up this month, of course, the Mexican elections coming up on midterms and coming up makes it hard. Mercosur is positively moving forward, so we're going to try and negotiate that. We got to make progress in those deals and that will set a good signal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me ask you, Mark. And turn to -- turn to Bitcoin because according to new research, you and Ernst &amp; Young did recently more than 10 percent of funds raised through initial coin offerings are lost or stolen in hacker attacks?</p><p>WEINBERGER: Yes. Well, this is -- as we know, it's a really complicated area and, you know, these coin offerings are plenty. There's over a hundred different indexes out there where they're coming in there's offerings. They are obviously susceptible to fraud and theft. They become more of an investment than a currency and so I think appropriately you have the government to look at it where we point it out there is that investors -- it's not an investor. It's really a tool to be a currency. You have to be cautious how you're investing in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: One more risk to watch around Bitcoin?</p><p>WEINBERGER: Always, a lot more.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark, great to see you.</p><p>WEINBERGER: Always, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us this morning, Mark Weinberger or EY. Coming up, General Electric releases its 4th quarter results missing earnings and revenue expectations. We'll break those numbers. Nonetheless, the stock is up 1-1/2 percent. And then more concerns over cybersecurity, Intel is telling customers to stop installing a software patch release to address a security flaw in their computer chips. We've got the details next. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are live this week at the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland. President Trump will be here tomorrow. Joining me right now and a first time Fox Business interview DowDuPont Executive Chairman, CEO Andrew Liveris who is also the head of the now disbanded president -- Americans Manufacturing Council. Good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>LIVERIS: Nice to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No. We're coming into this meeting there was a lot of optimism. But would you say that this is one of the most optimistic Davos meetings you've ever seen?</p><p>LIVERIS: Definitely one of the most optimistic and also one full of expectation for the president visit here on Friday. So really the topic is the president's visit. So most of us are getting all of that meetings done before tomorrow because I think it's going to tilt very quickly to what the president is going to say and kind of his team is kind of coming in already with meeting some of them. I had a couple of meetings today with U.S. officials. I've never seen such a strong U.S. delegation. So this is kind of opposite to America First thing. I mean this is America engaged and as a global company, this is a positive thing. And I think my European colleagues and the rest of the world colleagues Asian, Middle East, Africa, they're all kind of waiting to see how the U.S. will posture itself.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is a really good way to put it American engaged, I like that. How is the president doing in your view? I know that, you know, you were on that council. You were the chairman. It was disbanded. There was upset at that time, but how would you grade President Trump's by now?</p><p>LIVERIS: Well, from a year ago to present day even through the year with the disbanding of the council, I've been very consistent on that answer. This is a very business-friendly president, very business friendly administration, so I give him a strong A. I mean, you know, the tax reform you just talked about I mean but not just tax reform, the regulatory work is being done. It's astonishing. I've never imagined that much progress in 12 months or so and of course other work that I'm involved in which I'm on secretary of (INAUDIBLE) workforce reinvention counsel. This is the apprenticeship task force which is to redefine what the American system is producing in terms of skilled workers with digitalization approaching us. I'm very encouraged by that work and that early stuff that we're doing to change the way America supplies workers we need and so I'm very -- I give - - I give it a strong A.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's very important because we're seeing machine learning take over jobs and we're seeing new skillsets really required. OK. So positive marks on the tax reform package. We know that. We know what's going on but all of these companies coming out and saying how positive it is, but we're also seeing a debate around the trade story and that's I want to get your take on because the president issued new tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines from Asia, what do you make of this?</p><p>LIVERIS: Well, so, you know, now that -- you just said tax reform happening and let's skip the details of that finalized. But trade is of course on his agenda and the business agenda are topic he ran for office on and there's a lot of work to be done whether it be the redoing of NAFTA and whatever form it takes, the China discussion, and of course, all the things that the president worries about which is giving Americans jobs that they can count on for the future. You just mentioned machine learning and digitalization. We all know that's as big a potential job killer as anything in the trade agenda. So we've got all to engage our workers. We've got to engage the American public to actually put the facts in front of the table of what is the trade topic. And it isn't -- look at Dow, I mean I export from the United States to all countries of the world.</p><p>One in five of my jobs is based on America being a trader, so we got to keep trade. But what the president is doing is he wants to change the rules of engagement. And I think we all have to engage in that topic, so what are these rules? OK. It isn't just about putting tariffs on and on that tariff question, I mean we Dow make a polysilicon. That's a -- the raw material for solar panels. We've been excluded from the China market for the last five years, so that's not far. So these tariffs on solar panels is a way of sending a signal that it can't be one way. It can't be one-way trade and I support the president on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is really important because you've actually seen firsthand the impact of much cheaper products coming from China.</p><p>LIVERIS: Absolutely. And then, so American workers, we can't -- we are now having plants at risks, factories at risks because I can't access the China market and they favor their own producers, yet the solar panels are being -- coming over here and killing our solar panel industry in the United States. So there needs to be a recalibration with lots of conversation with Secretary Ross in the USTR on this topic. So that's an example of recalibrating the rules of trade and I'm all for that, but I think we need to get the facts on the table, get the rhetoric out of room, and, you know, what are these rules of engagement in terms of fair trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is the first explanation that really I've heard that make so much sense because you're right there and you're feeling it firsthand. The worry is of course, are we going to see retaliation? I mean are you going to China even get more secluded and even more protectionist in terms of their solar panels?</p><p>LIVERIS: Well, since antiquity and city-states, and bartering view, of course, get tit-for-tat. You, of course, get retaliation. This is what negotiation is. This president is a negotiator. We have a team of negotiations in the U.S. side. I'm a businessperson. I'm going negotiator. As long as we end up at the right spot, I think the rhetoric and the retaliation may will be part of the process. I'm convinced based on speed of tax reform and the speed of regulatory reform, this will not be one of these things that takes a lot of time. So I would encourage all my colleagues certainly our company to be engaged, to be at the table on what these tit-for-tats will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think we're going to see more of this like for example as it relates to aluminum and steel because the president did say -- he mentioned aluminum and steel and I think that is getting some people nervous that we're going to see more and more of this kind of tariff behavior and it's --</p><p>LIVERIS: Well, I'm not in -- I'm not in the room that decides which ones but I am telling you, if I look at chemicals, for example, we have a surplus. We're the second largest exporter from the United States. So we would hate to see if steel and aluminum thing happen and then chemicals, you know, give restrictions in terms of exporting from the United States into China or any other country, so I would be counter doing too much tit- for-tat. But I think this recent one is a strong enough message that the United States is serious.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. And you've given us phenomenal insight into this. Andrew, thank you for that.</p><p>LIVERIS: Not at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are such a retire as Chairman of DowDuPont later this year after overseeing its historic deal the merger late last year. Now, I know you are reporting earnings. You're going to be giving us guidelines on all of this in the coming week. But what can you tell us in terms of the timing of integration? What do you want to say to shareholders in terms of where you are today?</p><p>LIVERIS: Well, I think our shareholders from our last report to present day what I'll say and then what I'll say next week with specificity. This is on track. As you said, it's historic, 300 years of corporate history and to reconfigure these assets in a tax-free way pushing in a hold value for growth, for three companies, the new Dow which will be the materials company, the new agricultural company, the new specialty company. We're on track. And look, I can't be happier about the way the cultures of being assimilating, the integration work. We've got thousands of people working on this, not to mention all the help in the consultants' world that you can find. It's working and I would tell you that you right now and you'll hear more next week that it's basically on track.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then in terms of growth look at five years, where does the growth come from at this company?</p><p>LIVERIS: Well, I got to tell you that the humanity and sustainability which gets talked about here a lot. We need products that have full circulation capability. So all that work on light-weighting on batteries and cars, on the next car what that looks like.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a good point.</p><p>LIVERIS: Good packaging, what we do with food packaging, what we do with plastics in the ocean, what we do with carbon emissions, these are all opportunities for these companies would it be the agricultural one or the materials one, or the specialty ones, water, and water reuse, waste management, waste reuse, these are the opportunities that we're addressing through using out 7500 scientists.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So this is where the growth comes from?</p><p>LIVERIS: That's where it comes from.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about regulation. Obviously, this president has been rolling back regulations, have you felt it in your sector because I know other sectors they're not there yet and it sort of the smaller runway, what have you seen?</p><p>LIVERIS: Look, I can't speak strongly enough about how much we've felt it. It's not just -- it's not just the attitude. It's being specific and we've been asked, and it's kind of nice to be consulted to be at the front end of this, to use science, to say this regulation makes sense. This one doesn't. This administration has been unafraid to roll back regulations that make no sense. We felt it. We're feeling it on our bottom line. But more importantly, we're seeing it in a change in attitude on what's the smarter regulation. We are for regulation. We just want the right type of regulation to actually manage the behaviors of everyone in the value chain. We're a big player.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the pendulum just swung way too far. Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>LIVERIS: Always going to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Andrew Liveris there. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are coming to you live this week from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Speaking with the biggest names in business and innovation, cybersecurity, of course, one of the agenda topics here as companies like Intel are asking their companies and their customers to stop installing a software patch that it released to fix security flaws on computer chips. The company says that the patch is can cause, \"Unpredictable system behavior.\" Joining me right now to weigh in on that is the CEO of Cisco Chuck Robbins. Chuck, it's great to see you.</p><p>CHUCK ROBBINS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CISCO SYSTEMS: Great to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I want to talk broadly about what's happening in your business right now. But how are you combating the cybersecurity vulnerability like this one?</p><p>ROBBINS: Well, first of all, I think Intel is doing a reasonable job. It's obviously a significant issue. In the industry, we all try to come together when we have these kinds of issues occur and there's a great cooperative spirit between the major tech companies when we find these types of issues and we're working through it within just like everybody is, and I think they're doing the right things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What can you tell us about I.T. budgets today, Chuck? I mean here we are looking at an environment where people are talking about four percent economic growth. Your business is the gut to any other business in a whole host of sectors. So I want to ask you what you're seeing in terms of I.T. budgets. Are managers spending more on your products?</p><p>ROBBINS: Well, it's early in the year and every year when we start the new calendar year budgets begin to become more visible as we get into it. And we're in the latter part of our quarter now and so we'll be reporting earnings in a couple weeks and we'll give some insights into that. But I think that when you look at what happened here in the country and you look at tax reform, and you look at the positive feeling here in Davos that you have at least from an economic perspective, I think that there's a great deal of optimism around the world right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. There really is. What do you think is powering it? Because I think from your standpoint it's more than just tax reform, isn't it?</p><p>ROBBINS: Well, it is. And if you look at the economic situation around the world, it's -- I mean the central banks have done a great job. You've got stimulus has been put into the system. You have had a great, you know, since the 2008 crisis, we've had a -- we've finally got into a sustained recovery and now what you see happening that with our business is that as we've seen here in Davos if you go back three or four years, we were talking about the internet of things and now the fourth industrial revolution, and there's no doubt that that's occurring, and no one is talking about it. So here we're having conversations about how do we redefine the architecture inside a vehicle. Those are the conversations we're having now. So technology is permeating every aspect of life and industry, and as that happens as billions of things become connected. Obviously, that's good for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's talk about that because we were talking with Carlo Stone yesterday and he was saying, everything in a car today is technology related. So what areas of business are the most important in terms of powering your business? What sectors?</p><p>ROBBINS: Well, if you look at -- it's happening across every industry today. Primarily, we have seen early adoption in manufacturing of this industrial internet. We've seen retail move.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sorry about that.</p><p>ROBBINS: That's great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This must mean someone important is arriving.</p><p>ROBBINS: I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because a helicopter is here making lots of noise but hopefully they just passed. So you said manufacturing --</p><p>ROBBINS: Well, I just want you to know when I arrived in Davos, I wouldn't interrupt you like that visitor, you know, we've seen manufacturing. We've seen healthcare. We see connected cars. We made announcements of CES with Hyundai. I meet with a couple of car manufacturers here this week about what we can do together and then across our broader business just the connectivity of all these devices, the management of the data, the cybersecurity issues that are associated with it. They all provide great opportunities for us in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Because everything is connected today, so tell us how the Cisco products connect?</p><p>ROBBINS: Well, so I think they're circling to come back to see if they -- make sure you heard them the first time. So when you -- when you look at the connectivity of all of the platforms, the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stop. Just give it a minute first. It's going back at out, yes.</p><p>ROBBINS: It's (INAUDIBLE) they're going to land right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're right above us.</p><p>ROBBINS: They're going to land.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This helicopter.</p><p>ROBBINS: The matter of the issue is as we connect vehicles, as we connect vending machines, manufacturing facilities whatever they are, Cisco is the largest machine, the machine connectivity platform. Then after that, you have to actually take the data that's created and help our customers move that data to the place that they need it and whether it's in a public crowd, whether it's in a private cloud, or whether they want to assess and manage that data at the edge of the network, the network is going to play a great role, and then we fundamentally have to drive security in the network because there is no perimeter to defend it anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wonderful. Chuck, I'm so sorry.</p><p>ROBBINS: What did you say?</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is -- this is incredible. We're having a conversation --</p><p>ROBBINS: We had a funny experienced last year too, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But with the helicopters?</p><p>ROBBINS: No. We had one with a camera last year, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, that's right. Let me ask you real quick in terms of geography and where you see the best growth right now. Europe is growing. The U.S. is obviously a chunk of a four percent growth, is there a corner of the world that is doing better than others with regard to this kind of activity?</p><p>ROBBINS: Well, what I would say is that we see probably more consistent growth around the world than we've seen in a very long time as evidence by the discussions going on here. When we look at the adoption of the technology, we see emerging countries adopting the technology to try to solve problems in a massive scale whether it's in India, whether it's in China. And then we see obviously developed countries leveraging these technologies to look at how we make cities smarter that had optimized traffic and optimized citizen services, so it's really happening everywhere, it's amazing. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Incredible performance. So how do you keep this going?</p><p>ROBBINS: Well, I think that as long as this industrial revolution continues then we should be at the heart of all of that because as our customers connect more and more devices, the network is absolutely the foundation, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chuck, it's good to have you on the show. Thank you so much. This is great, this is incredible. This is actually funny.</p><p>ROBBINS: They're circling.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're circling. Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, we will be right back. Thank you so much.</p><p>LEIF SHIRAS, TENNIS CHANNEL COMMENTATOR: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report, a special presentation For Business. I'm Leif Shairs.

Don't forget, Tennis Channel's live coverage of the Australian Open continues Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. I'm Leif Sharis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here again Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, January 24th. Your top stories right now 8:34 on the East Coast. The White House descends on Davos. President Trump set to leave Washington for the World Economic Forum tonight. The trip comes as the White House makes good on the Commander-in-Chief's promise to put America first, this follows the overwhelming success of the President's tax plan.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin already on the ground and he is making news, the dollar is sliding this morning after Secretary Mnuchin said a weaker dollar is good for the U.S. economy and trade during a press conference in Davos. Markets this morning are rallying, take a look at the futures indicating that we will see a higher opening for the broader averages. This right here is the high of the morning. Up better than 100 points in unchartered territory once again. S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ also in unchartered territory. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P hit new record-highs yesterday.</p><p>Ahead of the President's trip, investors are watching earning this morning from the likes of General Electric and Comcast among others. G.E. reported earnings and revenue which were below expectation and yet the stock is trading higher. The stock up 2-1/2 percent as investors look for value after a huge selloff. Comcast also topped expectations although that stock is lower. European indices this morning are lower. The stocks in Europe, take a look, are weaker across the board pretty much. FT-100 down one-half of a half percent, the CAC quarante and DAX are also lower. In Asia overnight, markets close mostly higher, take a look. And as you see, the markets were higher with the exception of Japan which was down three- quarters of one percent.</p><p>Topping our news this half an hour, President Trump and America First at Davos. More than a dozen high-level members of the administration are arriving here to discuss economics, trade, cybersecurity and a lot more with the political and corporate leaders gathers here. Joining me right now is the United States Secretary of Energy, Secretary Rick Perry. Secretary, it's great to see you.</p><p>RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. The President's America First message, how do you think it will be received?</p><p>PERRY: Well, I think he have to understand what America First means to the President and the administration. It's really pretty simple from my perspective. This is about America being competitive around the globe. When folks were thinking about where you want to buy your energy from, where do you want that next load of LNG to come from? We want you to think about America first.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's a good way to put it. Well, the President has stressed really tapping into our oil reserves in America. Let's talk about that and where the opportunities are from your standpoint.</p><p>PERRY: Yes. Well, you think about 10 plus years ago and then 2005 we were -- besides ourselves, if you will and behind, other places where the oil and gas was coming from, you know, we had founded all, Peak oil. We heard all of those stories and then, you know, by the grace of God and some technology and a god by named George Mitchell from Texas, hydraulic fracturing came into play in a really big way and we were able to go into those tight shell formations and develop that which is now creating an absolute revolution in the oil and gas industry and completely changing the geopolitical dynamics in the world with America being at the forefront. We are now the number one oil and gas producing nation on the face of the earth. I mean, who would have thought that a decade ago that that would have been true. But it puts us in a very unique place. And here is what I try to share with all of our allies and for all the audience here at Davos is that the United States is not just exporting energy, we're exporting freedom. We're exporting to our allies in Europe. The opportunity to truly have a choice of where do you buy your energy from. That's freedom, and that kind of freedom is priceless.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is a really important point that you're making because for a long time America was reliant on places like Saudi Arabia and Russia to get energy but today it's a completely different situation in America. How significant is it? I mean, how would you characterize the supply that will be coming from the U.S. or to the global markets.</p><p>PERRY: You know, I'm not sure anything since World War II has been anymore dynamic from my perspective than they shift in the energy supply, energy control if you will. And again, the United States in the back controlling a country with this industry. It's about literally freeing up our allies around the world. Letting them know that we're going to be there for them, there's no strings attached when you buy American LNG. So, that is -- that's world-changing. And truly, this president, that's his message here. Is that the United States is -- it's a new day. The fossil fuels that we're going to be relying them on for decades to come are going to be available. Now, is our technology going to be able to allow us to use it wiser? With better results for the environment? Absolutely. The CCCU, the carbon capture utilization, we're doing projects with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>I'll see my counterpart (INAUDIBLE) today on a panel, we'll talk about the projects that we're working on together. The UAE, Qatar, all of those countries as we come together to develop and supply the rest of the world with the power so that they can have manufacturing (INAUDIBLE) in Africa. Being able to, you know, literally turn the lights on when the sun goes down so that their children can read, the people are safer. I mean, all of that is partly because of American ingenuity and our abilities to not believe the naysayers that people is here and you're not going to find any more of this</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, is there -- is there a way to characterize the amount of supply that will be coming from the U.S.?</p><p>PERRY: Well, you know, I hesitate to be a forecaster of what the home markets are going to be. I'll leave that up to people that are substantially more into that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, come on. You're the Energy Secretary. Let me ask --</p><p>PERRY: My job is to make sure that it's -- the abundant supply and I want to get people together so that they know that America is going to be a reliant supplier of that energy. The price will work itself though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you surprised where prices are by the way because it feels like the markets are focused more on the potential for terrorism or disruption. Where oil is right now.</p><p>PERRY: Well, those are realities of the world. But the fact is that we have an amazing I mean, you think about Anwar that the Congress just opened up again. You know, the previous administration closed it down, Congress working with the administration said, you know what, those nine million barrels are really important to the United States and to the world. So opening up markets that the previous administration have closed. I think it's in a very powerful message around the world that we're going to be a reliant supplier of energy into the foreseeable future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely. And I think that's why there's change happening in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>PERRY: Indeed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There is incredible change happening in other countries because they see what to expect from the U.S. By the way, what was behind the decision not to drill off of the coast of Florida?</p><p>PERRY: You know, I think that the administration through the Department of Interior sensitive to the issues there. There is plenty of space out there whether it's in the gulf, whether it's in Anwar, whether it's other areas that we can develop the energy resource we have. You know, the people of Florida said, hey listen, we don't want to add any new drilling platforms, the administration respected that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that was OK with the (INAUDIBLE) let me ask you about the President's news this week and that is these tariffs on solar panels and on washing machines, there is some conversation happening and as you know about worries about potential trade wars, about what China will do in response. Should we worry about a different trade stance from this administration?</p><p>PERRY: They shouldn't be worrying about this administration from the standpoint of transparency and fairness. That's what Donald Trump is all about. You want to compete against the United States, bring it but don't subsidize in a way that it's unfair, don't get into the market and try to gobble up all the market and then all of a sudden after you choked everybody else out of market, guess what, prices go up. This is a president that says, look, I get it about competition. But you're going to compete fairly, and you're going to compete on a level-playing field.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the President said that as it relates to jobs as well and when you look at the energy story, that's a real job creator. Can you characterize what we might see from all of the drilling and the fracturing that will happen in terms of job creation?</p><p>PERRY: Well, it's going to continue on. I mean, that's obviously for the states that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And consistent.</p><p>PERRY: And it's not just the jobs right in those states where it's happening, it's upstream or excuse me, it's downstream from that. It's the manufacturing. We think there is an incredible potential in the Appalachian region to turn that area into an absolute job-creating giant with the development of the Marcell or Shell with the other fossil fuels that are available there. You can duplicate the footprint of what you see along in Texas Gulf Coast in that Appalachian region and the jobs that get created. I'm promising you the governor of West Virginia and Ohio and Kentucky and Pennsylvania, they're going to be staying and they're saluting and saying, Mr. President, let's go, let's go make this happen, let's go make America great again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they're -- and these are high-paying jobs.</p><p>PERRY: Indeed. They are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you like the job? How do you like the role of energy secretary? What's new that you can tell us with this?</p><p>PERRY: Most interesting job I've ever had. Best job ever had was governor of Texas but this one is the most interesting and the coolest job mostly because of the 17 national labs that are out there involved in everything from cybersecurity to the next wave of small-moderate reactors to, you know, just the most fascinating new things that are going to be on the horizon for America. Our national labs are involved in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary, thank you for your leadership.</p><p>PERRY: You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Secretary Rick Perry. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. General Electric reported earnings that were below expectations, this morning. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching the stock trade up -- Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST: Hey, good morning, Maria. We know that General Electric has been in a turnaround phase. In the last August, Flannery came on as the new CEO to turn this thing around. Today, look at that, just in the last half hour, you -- a short time ago, we're saying it was up 2-1/2 percent. And look now, it's up 5.2 percent. So, what happened here? We did see ultimately, that the company in the latest quarter, they're really focusing on the overall -- the restructuring plan. The weakness that they've seen in operating profit and the revenue but ultimately that they're focusing on the aviation and health care divisions where they are seeing some strength.</p><p>There has been talk about this company being beaten down, and don't forget, it's down about 45 percent in the last 12 months. Is now the time to finally get into General Electric? I know you've had this conversation with many of your guests, but there's been talk of dividing up the company in some way. But that the turnaround and restructuring is underway, but you are seeing the stock now getting a big jump, Maria. Now, it's up 5-1/2 percent at 17.78. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you, Nicole. From Disney to Verizon and Starbucks, more U.S. companies handing out bonus checks, hiking wages for their workers after the tax reform overhaul. Joining me right now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that. Stu, it's just incredible the number of companies.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh, it's a flood. Look, I would call it a flood. Look, in the last 24 hours, we've got Disney, a thousand bucks to 125,000 employees, Verizon, I think is 2,500 bucks worth of stock to the employees; J.P. Morgan 10 percent wage increases for a big swath of their people. I mean, it's a long list, just in last 24 hours. It's clear, I think American business was on trial, they got everything they wanted from the tax cut deal, and now, they are indeed passing it along to the -- to the customers and also to their employees. But, you know, the big pass-through, I think, is still to come. I think that will come from the big tech companies of this world, when they repatriate all of that money. I think a lot of it goes to shareholders. And looking for stock buybacks like Comcast, for example, and I'm looking also for a dividend increases. That's the next round in this flood of pass-throughs and givebacks. Here it comes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a great point. I would also add on to financial services, Stu, because, you know, the banks really haven't even had the actual impact of regulation rollback. You know, that's to come, so there's this enormous runway there as well.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, look, it's a flood, that's what I'm saying. By the way, how is Davos treating you? Are being nice to you?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's good. I mean, you know, everyone's talking about President Trump.</p><p>VARNEY: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming tomorrow, and wondering what he's going to say, so he's definitely making a splash even before he arrives, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: Stick it to them, Mr. President</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you in 10 min, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, right after \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\". We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tax reform trickle down, Verizon, Disney, Starbucks have all announced perks for their employees as a result of the new tax cuts. Joining me right now live from the World Economic Forum is the CEO of Campbell Soup, Denise Morrison. Denise, great to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DENISE MORRISON, CEO, CAMPBELL SOUP: Hi, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your take on the tax package?</p><p>MORRISON: Well, I think the tax reform will be beneficial for business. We at Campbell's are going to realize a benefit from the reduced rate being largely United States company, we bear a rate over 30 percent and we expected that will come down pretty significantly. And what we're going to do with that is invest in our brands and pay down debt because we just made a very large acquisition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's talk about that acquisition. How does this acquisition fill in the whole that you were looking to do? What -- how does it give you a scale and tell us about the growth that you're expecting as a result?</p><p>MORRISON. Yes. Well, we've been on a journey to transform Campbell's and to transition our portfolio. Soup is a very important category but we now recognize that in order to deliver on the needs and wants of the next generation of consumers, we wanted to diversify our portfolio in the faster-growing spaces, and those spaces are health and well-being and snacking. And so, acquisitions were the key accelerator for that strategy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Lance, $50 a share in cash. A lot of people talked about this as really helping Snyder's-Lance -- helping the company fill in areas because people are looking for healthier options, wellness. Tell us about it.</p><p>MORRISON: We believe that this provides a snacking platform, a diversified snacking platform because we already have Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's, and Kelsen, so this adds more to the savory snacks in addition to the sweet snacks. And then if you start to think about our simple meals as convenient mini meals, it's right on trend with what the consumer is doing because, Maria, only 34 percent of consumers eat three square meals a day. Over 90 percent are snacking five times a day, so this is right on trend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting. So, the soup category, is that slowing down? I know the last quarter, a lot of people were worried that it showed that we're seeing a bit of a slowdown.</p><p>MORRISON: Yes, there are pockets of growth in the soup category, for example, we introduced a new Well Yes! Product that we co-created with consumers, and that's targeted for the younger generation, all clean label soups, so you can read every ingredient on the label, ingredients like quinoa and kale, right on trend. We also just closed on the acquisition of Pacific Foods, which is a soup and broth and plant-based beverage company. We're very excited about that company, and the growth rate of that brand is really exciting. So, we are starting to move into new spaces even within the soup category.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've got to change as consumer tastes change and people are looking for healthier options like the kale and quinoa.</p><p>MORRISON: It always starts with the consumer. And if you keep your eye on the consumer, they will take you where you need to go. And we spend lots of times with the consumers, we shop with them, we cook with them, we eat with them. Our team is having so much fun, sometimes it's hard to get them to come back to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, growth comes from acquisitions or organic?</p><p>MORRISON: Growth comes from both. You need to be innovation -- you have to have organic innovation and really push the thinking, you have to do some acquisitions but you also have to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks for joining us, everybody, we'l1 see you tomorrow. Here's Stuart and \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" Stu?</p><p>VARNEY: Thanks very much, Maria. All right.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018012403cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGJ-Y8F1-DXH2-6359-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8233\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 24, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp; RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS523999 MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC6022 STATE COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp; DISC RENTAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7841 VIDEO TAPE RENTAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>JPM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>JPM (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World Economic Forum</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAFTA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bitcoin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cisco</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>J.P.

He convened Thursday's White House \"social media summit of like-minded critics of Big Tech, excluding representatives from the very platforms he exploits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>In remarks to the participants, whom Trump called \"online journalists and influencers, Trump said, \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people.</p><p>\"You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter, he said.</p><p>The high-profile White House event raised the prospect of Trump using the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against big tech companies in the areas of competition and privacy.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign, and a bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump's volley of Twitter messages Thursday had familiar targets - \"certain companies, the press and his Democratic rivals - that have proven resonance with his political base. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020. He hailed himself as \"so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!</p><p>A \"big subject of the summit would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies, Trump said in his tweets.</p><p>\"We will not let them get away with it much longer, he said.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations expected to participate in the White House meeting are Turning Point USA, a nonprofit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. By policy, Twitter prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. weighed in on the subject Wednesday, tweeting, \"Twitter: We won't allow pro-life groups like @LiveAction to run ads on our platform' &amp; if you're a conservative we might ban you for 1st Amendment protected speech that we arbitrarily deem offensive.'</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect, the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday. \"Internet companies depend upon their users' trust from across the political spectrum to grow and succeed.</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.</p><p>\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives, said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who has been sharply critical of the big companies for reasons of their market dominance and effect on competition. He leads a House Judiciary subcommittee that has opened a bipartisan probe into the tech giants' market conduct.</p><p>\"If someone wants to show me some empirical data, instead of some alt-right member's paranoid claims, I'd appreciate it, Cicilline said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter and uses the platform almost daily to speak directly to his followers. He has a knack for tweeting outrageous, divisive or tongue-in-cheek missives that spur frenzied reactions from the mainstream press.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has accused Twitter, without evidence, of making it \"very hard for people to join me and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRGAZ-2019193505</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRGAZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMS-WWS1-DYT8-R1WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146813</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"957\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Charleston Newspapers</copyright><publicationName>Charleston Gazette-Mail</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019, Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As more than 50 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance, billionaires became <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">$637bn richer</url>.

Where did they go? The Trump administration hasn't enforced them.</p><p>Trump is also ignoring laws that ban trades on insider information. The White House is distributing billions in subsidies and loans to select corporations - enabling CEOs and boards to load up on stocks and stock options just before deals are announced, then rake in fat profits after stock prices surge.</p><p>Insiders from at least 11 companies have sold shares worth over $1bn after such announcements, according to an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">analysis</url> by the New York Times.</p><p>In late June, a San Francisco company called Vaxart announced that the Trump administration had selected it to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Presto. The value of stock options distributed to company insiders just weeks before increased <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">six-fold</url>. Stock options held by Vaxart's CEO went from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">$4.3m to more than $28m.</url></p><p>Moderna, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has never brought a vaccine to market, but company insiders have sold some $248m of shares - most of them after the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">was selected in April</url> to receive Trump funding. (Moderna plans to sell its vaccine for profit although taxpayers have footed its research and development.)</p><p>The most blatant involves the venerable old camera and film-maker, Kodak. On 28 July, Trump announced a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">$765m deal</url> with the firm to bring drug production back to the United States. He called it \"one of the most important deals in the history of the US pharmaceutical industries,\" even though Kodak isn't even a pharmaceutical company.</p><p>Before the announcement, Kodak had handed its board of directors <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">240,000</url> stock options, and just the day before had given its CEO <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">1.75m</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">stock options</url>. After Trump's announcement, Kodak shares shot up more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">2,757%</url>. Suddenly, the board's stock options were worth about $4m, and the CEO's, about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">$50m</url>.</p><p>Is this sort of insider trading against the law? You bet. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the deal, now temporarily on hold. But the SEC's co-director of enforcement, Steven Peikin, who had been investigating several of the deals involving the White House and corporate insiders - including Kodak - resigned last week, without explanation. Another in the lengthening list of independent regulators and inspectors general forced out by Trump?</p><p>This much is clear: Trump and his Republican enablers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">won't provide $600 per week</url> to tens of millions of Americans who need the money to survive the pandemic, because Trump and the GOP believe the money undermines incentives to work. Yet Trump has no problem letting billionaires illegally profit off the pandemic. He thinks that as long as they buoy the stock market, they're helping the American economy.</p><p>That's pure rubbish. The stock market is not America. The richest <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">1%</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">of Americans own half</url> the value of all shares of stock held by American households. The richest <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">10%</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">owns 92%</url>. For years now, stock prices have risen largely because <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7\">profits have been siphoned from the wages</url> of ordinary workers.</p><p>In the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, stock prices are almost back to where they were before the pandemic began. Big corporations and major investors are doing fine. Billionaires are doing better than ever. But most Americans are sinking fast.</p><p>This isn't just unfair. Much of it is illegal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-65071440</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JD-KPM1-JCJY-G13Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

And all of them, Axios' Sara Fischer and I report, reflect what a partisan issue the policing of social media content has become.Driving the news: California's postal balloting: Trump falsely suggested that all residents of California were being sent ballots (only registered voters will get them) and that anyone would be able to vote, even non-citizens. Because Trump's tweets, per Twitter spokesperson Lindsay McCallum, \"contain potentially misleading information about voting processes,\" Twitter affixed a message[1] to them pointing users to a fact check.Scarborough's staffer: Twitter said Tuesday it won't remove Trump's tweets baselessly suggesting MSNBC host Joe Scarborough[2] might have murdered a congressional staffer in 2001. It issued a statement saying it was \"deeply sorry about the pain these statements, and the attention they are drawing, are causing the family,\" but said Trump's tweets didn't violate its rules.Facebook's \"divisive\" system: The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that internal research at Facebook found its platform was exacerbating extremism[3] rather than bringing people together, but executives opted against taking action, in part out of fear of alienating U.S. conservatives. </p><p>Facebook executive Guy Rosen took to Twitter[4] to take issue with the Journal story.YouTube's China censorship: YouTube came under criticism[5] by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey for deleting comments that appeared to be critical of China. YouTube said the move was an error[6], but others say the issue is widespread and, according to The Verge, dates back to October[7]. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley pressed Google CEO Sundar Pichai for an explanation in a letter[8] Wednesday morning. Be smart: In each of these cases, questions of how platforms should treat controversial speech instantly became questions of what political statement any action (or inaction) by the platform would make. \"Whose side are we taking?\" became at least as important a question as, \"How fairly and consistently are we applying our own rules?\" The Trump factor: The president has been at the center of many of these controversies since taking office, posting or resharing messages that include falsehoods, conspiracy theories and personal attacks, often in apparent violation of platform rules. Twitter's action to label the vote-by-mail tweets, though unprecedented, was still a mild rebuke, with the company simply pointing people to a Twitter \"moment\"[9] consisting of articles discussing the tweet and its errors.Meanwhile, the company rejected a call from the Scarborough staffer's surviving husband to delete Trump's tweets on that matter.Facebook, for its part, left Trump's vote-by-mail comments up without comment. Yes, but: Trump and some allies are pointing to Twitter's action as evidence to support their longstanding claims that tech platforms are biased against conservatives. The president tweeted[10] Tuesday night: \"Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election.... Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!\"He doubled down with more tweets[11] this morning: \"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\" Reality check: Trump can neither tell Twitter what to do nor unilaterally shut the company down. But the threat of regulation and investigation is more substantial, and his allies in Congress can try to pass laws to change its practices. The Wall Street Journal reported[12] Saturday that Trump was \"considering establishing a panel to review complaints of anticonservative bias on social media.\"And Hawley[13] and fellow Republican Sen. Marco Rubio[14] both argued the fact check means Twitter should lose its liability from lawsuits over user-posted content, a sweeping change that would require an act of Congress.

It wrapped up just a short time ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's not all. Conservatives are now calling for the president to go on offense against the Mueller probe now that a lot of it is kind of anti- Trump bias has been made clear.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, a so-called bomb shell report from CNN on <person><nameText>Donald Trump Jr. </nameText></person>and Wikileaks blows up in the network's face.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And some more Trump gifts including the booming economy and the best job's market since the year 2000.</p><p>But first, to tonight's top story, the president brought down the house tonight in Florida, Pensacola. The White House billed the rally as a campaign-style event for Trump, but it was also held so close to the Alabama border, it also served as a rally for embattled GOP Senate candidate, Roy Moore.</p><p>Alabama special election is held on Tuesday. Here are a few highlights from the raucous night in Florida.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Tonight, we are going to speak straight to the American people and cut right through the fake news media, right through. I think it's going to be very hard for somebody to beat us in a few years. Can you imagine now we're only talking about a few years? All you have to say is with us it goes up, with them it goes down. That is the end of the election, right?</p><p>Did you see all the corrections the media has been making, they sorry, we made a -- they have been doing that all year? They never apologized. Maybe that comes with being the president. I don't know. They took the fraudster from ABC and suspended him. They should have fired him for what he wrote.</p><p>He drove the stock market down 350 points in minutes, which, by the way, tells you they really like me, right, when you think of it. You know what he calls people? And I said to everybody get yourself a lawyer and sue ABC News and then CNN apologized just a little while ago. They apologized. Thank you, CNN. Thank you so much. You should have been apologizing for the last two years.</p><p>These resistors resist. Hilary resist and then you know what happened? She lost the election in a landslide. You know what? They are resisting? They are resisting the will of the American people. It is being proven we have a rigged system does not happen so easy, but this system will be a lot of changes. This is a rigged -- this is a rigged system.</p><p>This is a sick system from the inside. And -- you know, there is no country like our country, but we have a lot of sickness in some of our institutions. It is wrong and dangerous for congressional Democrats to hold troop funding hostage for amnesty, letting people pour in our country. We don't know who they are or where they come from. You saw what happened with beautiful Kate Steinle.</p><p>That was a total miscarriage of justice. He didn't know it was a gun. The real changes that we are facing are the drugs and the gangs pouring into our country. The millions of people over staying their visas.</p><p>Chain migration that cost taxpayers billions and billions of dollars and sanctuary cities that set free violent criminal aliens all over our country and protect them. People come in and they are not necessarily good like the man that ran over -- the animal many people in New York City. We have to end chain migration. We have to end chain migration.</p><p>One by one we are finding illegal alien drug dealers, gang members, thieves, criminals and killers preying on our children, everybody, and we are throwing them the hell out of our country or put them in prison.</p><p>And because our borders are strong as they should be and they will get much stronger, we will not let these people back in. How many people here are from the great state of Alabama? You see what happened today, you know the year book? Did you see that?</p><p>There was a little mistake made she wrote things in the year book. What are we going to do? Gloria Allred, anytime you see her you know something is going wrong. We cannot afford this country the future of this country cannot afford to lose a seat in the very, very close United States.</p><p>We can't afford it. We can't afford to have a liberal Democrat, who is completely controlled by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. We can't do it. His name is Jones and he is their total puppet and everybody knows. He will never vote for us. We need somebody in that Senate seat who will vote for our make America great again agenda. We want jobs, jobs, jobs so get out and vote for Roy Moore.</p><p>Troops don't wear a foreign uniform. We will never surrender our rights to international tribunals. We will not do that. We proudly sing the Star Spangled Banner. Our brave troops fight and die for the red, white and blue, and we protect and preserve the American constitution that we cherish.</p><p>I've said it so often that my job is not to be president of the world. My job is to be president of the United States of America.</p><p>We need some love in the country. I love to bring both sides together if that is possible. There a lot of hatred out there, but I would love to be able to bring both sides together.</p><p>The same failed voices in Washington, who oppose our movement right from the beginning are the same people who have undermined the credibility of our government institution. The Washington insiders who oppose our movement are the same people who sacrificed our sovereignty and wealth, borders, look at our country. They've had their chance of running this country and they failed.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Our guys did amazing edit on that. That's all I can say. They turned that around so fast.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss it all here in Washington, former U.N. ambassador, John Bolton, and Chuck Rocha, former senior advisor to the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, and from Utah, former congressman and House Oversight Committee chair, Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>All right. I will go to you, John, first what is your take on Trump and Pensacola tonight. He is on offense and happy times are here again. Economy is rolling, where ISIS is on the run. Everybody should be happier. I want to bring both sides together, but there was a classic Trump in rare form here.</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Well, he certainly very energized for those who say the burdens of the presidency doesn't want it. He is looking for a way to get out. I didn't see any of that tonight.</p><p>I thought particularly the lines on the economic growth in the country were a good foretaste of what the election campaign is going to look in November of 2018. That he is delivering by removing the cloud of more taxes, regulations. That economic growth has spurted, and I think will go on.</p><p>Just for my own point of view, when he talks about American sovereignty, it resonates, and it resonates not just with traditional Republicans. It resonates right in the heart of the core Democratic constituency, the blue- collar vote, and that's what won him the election in 2016. And if he can keep that together, he'll keep winning.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Chuck, let's go to you. You work for Bernie Sanders, we will play a Sanders soundbite in a moment, but Sanders ran on getting back to the heart of the American worker, the American people, and he kept saying tonight as he said before, I'm for the working man and for the working people, the forgotten people.</p><p>And I stay on this issue of trade where Trump says I want to bring both parties together. There are ways for some Democrats to work with him on these trade deals and the renegotiation of them. I know everyone says we are not going to work with Trump, but on that issue, I think some of the Sanders supporters could work with Trump. What do you think?</p><p>CHUCK ROCHA, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO BERNIE SANDERS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: I have been doing campaigns for 27 years and I grew up in East Texas and went to worked in a tire factory when I was 19. The reason I became a Democrat I started fighting Bill Clinton in the trade agenda because they sent my job to China where my father worked and five of his brothers.</p><p>It inspired me to get involved in politics. It resonates with a group of people that I saw get motivated, who have never been motivated before, traveling on the road with Bernie, and I think that's why you probably saw some of the Bernie Sanders supporters when it came down to a general election probably support Trump, the numbers bear that out, right?</p><p>Tonight, sitting at home knowing that we were going to talk about this, I watched the speech and prepared lots of politicians for speech and he is at his best when he's in this element. When you get him out of that element and he gets on Twitter, sidetracked, that's when we take advantage of him. But tonight, he was at his best because that's what he loves doing, it's rallying his base</p><p>INGRAHAM: Jason, a lot of people today are talking about how the Republicans are -- you know, they are not going in offense enough. They are not hitting the Mueller probe which is filled with all these Democrat partisans.</p><p>Folks are saying hit harder on this stuff. The Clinton did that very successfully against Ken Starr and his band of prosecutors. Trump tonight seemed energized. He didn't seem someone who they say is mentally deficient. He has dementia. That's what the whole MSNBC crowd has been saying for months.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER UTAH CONGRESSMAN: Well, I don't know that anybody is even watching those other networks. That bears out in the number, but this is <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>at his best and it is about playing offense and making America great, and he is producing results.</p><p>And that is what showing up when he talks about their 401ks, home ownership in communities that have not had high home ownership and employment numbers are doing well. I mean, I do think the president needs to continue to play offense and pound on that law.</p><p>I mean, some of them the lines resonated the best when the president talks about securing our boarders, locking down those borders and building the wall.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And he thinks, John, that Roy Moore even with the past allegation as horrible as they are to so many people, he needs that Senate vote. He needs the vote. He needs that support in the Senate for everything he is doing. Yet, could that come back to bite him in 2018 and some of these other close races?</p><p>BOLTON: Well, certainly, the Democrats are going to try and make it come back. Look, I find a real irony here, you know, the most straight-laced bigoted hard lined people are all in the belt buckle of the bible belt, right?</p><p>These people are so moralistic they have no tolerance for anybody else. They all are going to vote for Roy Moore next Tuesday, but the open-minded, tolerant, libertarian, cosmopolitan people in the cities are absolutely against him.</p><p>There is a real inversion here and I think what it reflects is the support Trump has across the working class vote not just in the south but in the north too. I think people recent the political correctness and that's what you are seeing.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. Now, we will play Bernie Sanders from earlier today on CBS this morning. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: We have for president of the United States acknowledged on a tape why seen all over this country that he assaulted women. I would hope that may be the president of the United States might pay attention what is going on and also think about resigning.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Chuck, wasn't that classic Bernie? I mean, we saw Al Franken forced out allegations that -- I mean, if I were Al Frankin and I was innocent of those allegations, I would have stayed there and fought it out.</p><p>I said on the show with Newt Gingrich I think it is outrageous that 30 senators can push out someone who is elected by the voters of Minnesota even though he and I don't agree on anything.</p><p>But what about this? Trump should resign because of the Billy Bush tape, but the American people elected Trump. They heard that tape. I was disgusted by it frankly, but they heard that tape and elected him anyway. What does that say about the American people in those key states thought about the old ways of politics that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>talked about tonight?</p><p>ROCHA: I think you are talking about two different things that I agree with partially is that at a moment in time in politics anything can happen. Bernie is being Bernie. Bernie is talking to his base. Bernie is doing smart politics.</p><p>As an advisor of Bernie, I would always advise him to talk to those people who were frustrated, who may have even voted for <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>who voted for us in the primary who now may be feeling disillusioned about one issue more than this --</p><p>INGRAHAM: The economy is doing great.</p><p>ROCHA: Does the average American working man feel that?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>ROCHA: We just stopped talking. Went up twice as much under Barack Obama, we didn't talk about that --</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think so because wages are finally starting to crawl up a little bit.</p><p>ROCHA: I agree with that. We haven't had real wage growth in 21 years. I think that the elections that were held a month ago were another true barometer when the Republicans got their clot cleaned in Virginia. It's another snapshot in town.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Virginia is a Democrat state now, you know --</p><p>ROCHA: But the Republicans had a 17-seat majority in the state house to be such a Democrat state. So, the Republicans must have been doing something there. It is a moment in time snapshot so that's what made me think, well, if the economy was doing so well, how did we do so well when Republicans have such a majority?</p><p>INGRAHAM: One thing, Jason, and I thought was interesting is what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said about what's happened in NATO since he gave that speech urging NATO members to pay their fair share. He was smashed by the elites for having the temerity to actually asked other countries to pay up, this is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>PRESIDENT TRUMP</nameText></person>: It helps them a hell of a lot more than it helps us, OK. They should pay. Germany is paying 1 percent. We're paying 4 percent, explain that one to me, right? Germany has unsustainable cash flow. I read a report their cash flow is unsustainable.</p><p>So, I said, Angela, send a little of that cash flow our way, and she said, but Donald -- because we are protecting them. We have 40,000 soldiers in Germany. Nobody knows that. Let us have some, she said, Donald, the German people would not be happy with that. I said but you what? The American people are not happy with the way we have it now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: And at that point, I believe he said. We got $30 billion more in the dues that have been paid at NATO for -- we are actually getting more out of this whoe arrangement.</p><p>Jason, I think that it's so powerful for people who said, why are we paying the money at the U.N. We are not getting equal participation and we are carrying a lot. We are happy to do it, but people have to pay more. I thought it was a great moment.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It was a great moment. I can tell you I lead a congressional delegation trip, 11 members. We traveled through a number of countries that are allies of the United States. And I'm telling you to a \"t\" every single one of them lead their meetings with us by explaining to the 11 members of Congress what they were doing in order to pony up and pay more money.</p><p>Money that they knew was already due and there is only one reason that happened, and it is because President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>made it an issue. He said it during the campaign and following through and every one of those countries was worried about it because they have to have the United States, the military might of the United States in order to survive and it is a better, fairer deal, and good for America.</p><p>INGRAHAM: John, I have to take a bite of that apple because he was trashed for that. He was saying an isolationist. You will not (inaudible) and he was going all over the world with 12 stops in his Asian tour, 12-day tour, China, Vietnam, Korea.</p><p>This is not a man who is not afraid to travel, but he just wants to do more bilateral trade deals and have a more honest and open and fair relationship with these countries.</p><p>BOLTON: Look, I mean, I think the American foreign policy bureaucracy is very hard pressed to say anybody ever violates a treaty, trade treaty, arms control treaty. They do it all the time. What Trump has said is we are not going to let that go on. That resonates and he is right about it too. That's how you get to free trades.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You know, Gentlemen, with Trump racking up some big wins and the partisanship we've discovered in the Russian probe now just may be the moment for the president to turn the tables and go on the attack against Mueller and his biased gang. We are going to have that debate next. Thank you for being here, Gents. Stay right there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The special prosecutor's investigation so far has turned up no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia, none, zero, nada. With every passing day, we learn more about the shocking anti-Trump biased of Bob Mueller's team.</p><p>Peter Strozk, Jamie Rhee, and Andrew Wiseman (ph), the list keeps growing and growing and just today we learned that Attorney Aaron Zebway (ph), who is known as Muellers right hand man, previously represented the guy who helped set up Hillary's private e-mail system, I can't even believe this, and who later destroyed two of her mobile devices with a hammer.</p><p>I wish we could put that hammer in the Smithsonian. The president's allies have had enough and according to the \"Wall Street Journal\" are now urging him to go on the offense against a probe that now seems (inaudible) but a partisan political lynch mob if you ask me.</p><p>Joining us now from Phoenix is Republican Congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona and here in Washington, Democratic strategist, Michele Jawando of the Center for American Progress.</p><p>Michele, I want to start with you because -- when you look at this list, I think we have a graphic of the contributions that some in his team have made. James Quarles (ph) has given $30,050 dollars to Democrats.</p><p>Jeannie Rhee, $9,150, Andrew Weissmann, $4,000, Greg Andres, Andrew Goldstein, Elizabeth Preloger, Brandon Ven Grack, Rush Atkinson, $200. That's not a big deal, but all the other ones, they are not insignificant.</p><p>You add that the fact that a lot of them represented the Clinton Foundation and Ben Rhodes. How does the regular American person not look at this Mueller team as just a bunch of Trump adversaries, political adversaries, who want to undue a presidential election?</p><p>MICHELE JAWANDO, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Well, I think there are a few things. When we say in this country that you can serve in law enforcement, we don't have a political test for those individuals. I come from a family of prosecutors.</p><p>When you sign up and you say you want to serve your country, there is no test. You don't have to pledge allegiance to a president. You pledge it to this country. When Robert Mueller has found out about individuals who he was concerned about conflict of bias, he fired them, and that's exactly what we want him to do. So, I understand --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why didn't he reveal it at the time when he got rid of Strzok in July. Why didn't he revealed that to the American public given the gravity of this investigation?</p><p>JAWANDO: Right. I mean, I think if we remember the purpose of this investigation is national security. So, I think what he is focusing on is how do we keep this country safe --</p><p>INGRAHAM: So, you don't think any even appearance of a conflict with this group of people involved in an investigation that could lead to the impeachment of a president. No appearance of a conflict. Not even an actual conflict because if there is an appearance of a conflict, as a lawyer, you are supposed to reveal what your potential conflict could be and to me the revelations are it's like (inaudible) pulling teeth to try to get this information.</p><p>JAWANDO: You know, but don't we want him to actually do what he did, which is to fire those individuals --</p><p>INGRAHAM: No, I want to know what they've said politically, their e mails, text have said.</p><p>JAWANDO: If we focus on every individual as opposed to the purpose of this investigation --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Do you know what (inaudible)?</p><p>JAWANDO: Of course, I do.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right. So, if you have if you have ill-gotten gains -- because of a bad actor or a biased actor, everything that come as a result could be called into question. I want to go to Congressman on this.</p><p>Congressman, I find the president's legal team frankly to be a little bit almost gun shy to question the Mueller team. The president was very tough on the Justice Department and has been in some tweets, but his legal team has been more circumspect there.</p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Yes, and I think they are wrong to be circumspect because what we have here -- this is the very swamp creature that all of America is looking at because it is not that Robert Mueller said, this is why we got rid of Strzok.</p><p>We had to find out. That came through FOIA request. Congress has asked for information. We are not getting it. The only thing we find out from General Sessions and Director Wray is they don't even have a process for vetting and conflict of interest.</p><p>So most private sector law firms and even prosecutorial agencies, if you have a biased, you got to disclose that bias because it is an ethical violation to take a conflict of interest case.</p><p>So, people check that out. These biases are not inconsequential. If you are giving $30,000 to Democrats, guess what, you are all in. If you are being critical of <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>in an overt way showing up at resist movement issues. You are not just saying, hey, I'm a political participant.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It undermines the credibility. Does this man undermine the credibility of an investigation when you have rank partisans who worked for Ben Rhodes and worked for the Clinton Foundation and now someone who actually represented the guy who destroyed the e mail -- the devices with a hammer?</p><p>So, you are actually working for the political adversary of the guy you are now investigating. Now, if that is not an apparent conflict of interest then I don't know what is. I think it undermines the overall integrity of an investigation that frankly should be unassailable giving the gravity of it. Michelle, you can close out.</p><p>JAWANDO: Laura, I think we need to remember that we are talking about someone, who serve this country in Vietnam. He has had respect on both sides of the aisle for years, and if we are now saying that someone who is respected as Robert Mueller is --</p><p>INGRAHAM: That he can never make a mistake?</p><p>JAWANDO: Of course, you can make a mistake, but the question is, why are we raising these questions now as he continue --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Because we are finding out the information now.</p><p>JAWANDO: -- closer to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>inner circle?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: When Bill Clinton went after Ken Starr's legal team for being bias, did you criticized him for doing that?</p><p>JAWANDO: When we are focused on national security and when we want to get to the root of what role --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: There is no Russia collusion. That was long ago.</p><p>JAWANDO: This is about protecting one another.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Where the Russian collusion?</p><p>JAWANDO: He is not interested in going after partisans. He is interested in keeping --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Where is the Russian collusion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: There is none.</p><p>JAWANDO: It is comical that the FBI --</p><p>INGRAHAM: It is comical that you can't answer the question.</p><p>JAWANDO: -- men at the FBI and now --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Who cares?</p><p>JAWANDO: -- we are saying that all of the sudden --</p><p>INGRAHAM: No, no. There are people on the investigation --</p><p>JAWANDO: Almost like comical.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK. So, Andrew Weissmann is a raging conservative?</p><p>JAWANDO: I think it is almost comical.</p><p>INGRAHAM: What is comical is that you did not criticize Bill Clinton's people when they were trashing Ken Starr. As I recall, I don't think those guys were being criticized because they were actually smart.</p><p>They went on the offense against Ken Starr and that's why in the end the Starr report ended up leading to impeachment, but in the end Bill Clinton ended up more popular because last time I check, the gals in the Senate ended up doing a pep rally for Bill Clinton after that impeachment.</p><p>JAWANDO: National security isn't a part of the issue.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Congressman, close it out.</p><p>BIGGS: Well, look, nobody is criticizing Mueller's veteran's history. We are criticizing he is conducting this investigation, which is loading up the team. It's like playing basketball and not only is the other team is against you but all the refs, the score keeper and everyone else. That is what you got going on here.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right.</p><p>BIGGS: And that's the problem with Mueller.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK. The establishment guys and the media may have bigger black eye than the special prosecutor's office this week capped off by a massive screw up at CNN today. Wait until I tell you about this one.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Sometimes it's not fake news, it's just wrong news. Sloppy, fact checking not done, sloppy reporting. This morning CNN breathlessly delivered that they advertised this major scoop.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Breaking news in the Russia investigation, and two CNN exclusive reports. This morning, newly surfaced emails show an effort to give hacked WikiLeaks documents to the Trump campaign.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: <person><nameText>Donald Trump Jr. </nameText></person>and others in the Trump organization received an email in September of 2016 offering a decryption key and website address for hacked WikiLeaks documents. This is according to a September 4th, 2017 email.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We now know looking at timing that Manu reported, that Don Jr., the president's son, tweeted about WikiLeaks for the first time the same day that this mail he doesn't recall came through. Politically just difficult for the team, or legally some implications here?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: One little problem, they got the date wrong. This shows the e mail sent to Don Jr. last year on September 14th, not the 4th. That was after WikiLeaks had already made those documents public, leaving CNN once again with a fried egg on its face. This was just the latest in a long line of media screw ups.</p><p>Look at these examples from just the past seven days. In addition to the CNN mistake, ABC News incorrectly claimed that candidate <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>directed Mike Flynn to contact Russians during the 2016 campaign. It actually happened when he was already president-elect, big deal. And \"The New York Times\" had to heavily amend a report that former Trump aide K.T. McFarland lied to Congress about Flynn's communications with the Russians, and multiple outlets walked back stories that Deutsche Bank received a subpoena from Bob Mueller, targeting Trump's bank records regarding real estate deals.</p><p>Joining now with reaction is Jim Warren, the chief media writer for the Poynter Institute, a society of professional journalists, along with Roger Simons, CEO emeritus of PJ Media and an Academy Award nominated screenwriter. I would love to have that bio after my name, Roger.</p><p>Let's start with you, Jim. You represent a society of professional journalists, Jim. This has been a wild week for journalists given the mistakes and the fact checking and they sloppy reporting. And we just mentioned a few there. What are your thoughts, especially on CNN rushing out with this Don Jr. story this morning?</p><p>JIM WARREN, CHIEF MEDIA WRITER, POYNTER INSTITUTE: Yes, you are right. In less than a week have you this and you have the one I think last Friday, Brian Ross of ABC News who was also suspended for botching a Michael Flynn story that targeted <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>And this in case people missed it, the basic thrust was that there was a coziness between WikiLeaks and the curious Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and <person><nameText>Donald Trump Jr. </nameText></person>As you just said the critical mistake happened to be one digit, September 4th rather than the 14th, and in fact by the time that Don Jr. tweeted this, as you said, all this stuff was publicly available.</p><p>Now I think a lot of this is explained by the nature of the Internet and putting a primacy on speed. And I think it's got nothing to do with --</p><p>INGRAHAM: No bias? No bias, Jim?</p><p>WARREN: I think --</p><p>INGRAHAM: The mistakes go one way. That's why, Jim. They always to go against Trump. They never seem to be wow the economy is even better, or Mueller hasn't found anything yet. You know what I mean, it always seems to go against Trump. So I think it hurts the media's credibility.</p><p>Roger, you can weigh in and Jim can come back.</p><p>ROGER SIMON, ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATED SCREENWRITER: I'm nodding my head for a reason. I think that there is a real psychological component in this. Why do intelligent people make so many mistakes? And the reason I think is a Trump derangement syndrome. I think these people hate Trump so much that they will grab a fact like that that is bad for Trump and just accept it without doing the normal due diligence that any intelligent report would do, especially from organizations like Reuters and CNN which have tremendous facilities. But they don't do it because they are anxious to get him.</p><p>The hatred is what -- I think we all know that hatred does bad things to everybody's head. It does it bad to mine. Every time I'm hating somebody I can't write or think very well. And I think that is a factor here. I don't know. I don't know if my colleague agrees but I really find --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Guys, I want to play one more sound bite from tonight's rally and have you both react. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>(R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They took this fraudster from ABC, they suspended him for a month. They should have fired him for what he wrote. And then CNN apologized just a little while ago. They apologized. Oh, thank you, CNN. Thank you so much. You should have been apologizing the last two years.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Jim, I think the media get their back up when he says stuff like this, but it actually worked. I think most people are fed up with a bunch of things. Washington, they're sick of lawyers, and they're tired of the media. And I think it plays right in to what most people think is that the media is pretty biased and biased towards the left wing.</p><p>WARREN: I think one of the most interesting piece of survey information I have seen in the last year is how, and I think this is related to speeches like tonight, only about a year ago, Laura, about 75 percent of Republicans, 75 percent of Democrats all supported the notion of the media having a watchdog role. That's now dramatically changed among conservatives and now that number is in the 40s.</p><p>I think one does have a lot of mistakes. I do think there is a primacy on speed which can trap many of us. But we're also forgetting the spectacular work that's being done every day of late on the whole issue of sexual harassment by \"The New York Times,\" and the \"Washington Post\" has also done a good job.</p><p>And in the case like <person><nameText>Donald Trump Jr. </nameText></person>today, very quickly out of the box for several media reports, notably \"The Washington Post\" for a terrific, comprehensive story calling out CNN and making clear what exactly were the facts with <person><nameText>Donald Trump Jr. </nameText></person>and at the same time making note that there were other examples that are irrefutable of a fairly cozy relationship between WikiLeaks and <person><nameText>Donald Trump Jr. </nameText></person>when it came to WikiLeaks at other times tipping him off to stuff that was very unflattering to the Clinton Campaign.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right, well, it's that time of year, by the way, time for your office Christmas parties. But is the \"Me Too\" movement killing the fun? And wait until you here who Silicon Valley nerds are inviting to their parties. Stay right there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The rich tech nerds of Silicon Valley are hiring models, they're modelizing, attending their holiday gatherings, making them look cooler. And Actor Seth Rogen is now boycotting Sirius XM Radio for an utterly inane reason. But first, is the \"Me Too\" movement becoming a spoiler for this season's Christmas parties?</p><p>Joining us now with more is comedian Jimmy Failla. All right, Jimmy, I'm not a big office Christmas party person myself. But I can see this year it might be a little less festive, let's just say that. And no alcohol, no fun, no lampshades, no nothing, and I don't know, maybe that is better. But is this killing all the fun of Christmas?</p><p>JIMMY FAILLA, CONSERVATIVE COMIC: In terms of office parties what we are talking about here is Vox placed a two drink maximum on all of their employees, Laura, which I think is going to make people drunker because now they are going to pregame before they get to the party. If you know you are getting cut off at two. It's like when you go to a college football game, Laura, you know they don't serve beer in the stadium so you drink triple in the parking lot.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You do the funnel drinks. You need two drinks just to get through reading Vox.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Forget getting the -- but how do they monitor the two drink maximum? I almost minimum. The maximum.</p><p>FAILLA: They said that they are going to give out drink tickets. But I'm the opposite of you. I am pro holiday Christmas party.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Are you?</p><p>FAILLA: Yes, because I think it serves a cathartic purpose, which is to build camaraderie over someone getting trashed and humiliating themselves. You know we get that one night a year to be like hey, I can't believe Simmons took his shirt off and jumped in the water fountain, you know what I mean, and I only know that because I have been Simmons several times in the past.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I heard that last week. By the way, I have a question, Jimmy. Are you in a swivel chair? You're swiveling.</p><p>FAILLA: My bad. I was excited be here, Laura Ingraham.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You are like my kids at the din are table. They're moving. I see you. You are making me dizzy.</p><p>FAILLA: That's funny.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Sirius XM, now tell us about, you knew someone at Sirius XM because now we've got Seth Rogen who in that show, what is it, \"The Disaster Artist.\"</p><p>FAILLA: Yes. It's a mess.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He was in \"Superbad,\" and \"Knocked Up\" and all these -- he is a veritable Richard Burton. I always get him mixed with Jonah Hill. But he is now not going to be on, he doesn't want to be on Sirius XM because Bannon has a show?</p><p>FAILLA: Seth Rogen is a dope. First and foremost, Seth Rogen, it just speaks to such a total lack of self-awareness on his part because he got famous making stoner comedies. And nobody wants political advice from their stoner friend. You know what I mean. If you recommend a Ben and Jerry's flavor, I get it. But this idea of anyone in Hollywood questioning the character of a person in public is a little rich, considering the year that they've had. I just thought that was a little silly. And I think he should stick to doing what he does best, which is making bad movies.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think that no one is really going to miss Seth Rogen's presence on Sirius XM. We are not exactly talking about a large audience, anyway. But I actually liked him better when he was fat. He had a presence when he was fat, and when he got skinny he started taking himself too seriously.</p><p>FAILLA: Yes. He lost his jolliness. I like fat Elvis better than skinny Elvis. I thought fat Elvis had a relatable, self-aware thing to him that I think Seth Rogen got away from. And I think, Laura, that they don't recognize that their audience does not want this from them. If you watch Seth Rogen movies it is not because you want activism. It's because you like goofy stories.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Because they are really stupid.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: I don't know these movies. I go, what, \"Pineapple Express\"? I didn't even know that movie.</p><p>Let's talk about the modelizing that's going on at some of these really big tech companies because they have a lot of coders, they have a lot of kids that sit around all day and they code. And they are not exactly lacrosse players. They are geeky kids like my executive producer. He's a lacrosse player. He's a big guy. But these are little weeny sized guys. They are smart, but they hire these models both women and men to come in and mingle, but they won't take anyone's cards. They are not really hooking up but they are just a presence to make them look cooler. How pathetic is that?</p><p>FAILLA: Yes, it is such a cruel thing to do to these poor nerds because they have been striking out with women their whole lives. The reason, Laura, that they are running Silicon Valley is because of the trauma of being rejected in society the way they were. It's like a Napoleon complex. So to subject them to more off limits women, this is the starving man and you are giving him plastic fruit, you know what I mean. It can't do him any good. Why not go a step further and have a gym class pickup basketball game when they get to be chosen last again.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Dodge ball.</p><p>FAILLA: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I want dodge ball. I want to play them all in dodge ball.</p><p>It is great to see you and thank you so much for being with us. We could all use a little goodness. We all need Christmas parties, and we all need more Christmas parties and we all need to have fun, but be responsible. We have a lot more to get to. Do not touch that channel.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So many gifts to be thankful for this Christmas, and some of them courtesy of the president and his administration. Think about all these gifts. Stocking is full this year. Take the booming economy, the stock market just keeps hitting record highs. Investor confidence soaring. Jobs are back big league. We just learned today that unemployment is down to 4.1 percent, the lowest level since the Clinton administration.</p><p>More than two million new jobs have been added since the election. Record low unemployment for manufacturing. The Hispanic unemployment rate is down to 4.7 percent, the lowest in American history. Red tape and regs, they're being slashed at the EPA and many other businesses. And major tax relief is on the way including the death of the Obamacare individual mandate, thank goodness.</p><p>ISIS has been basically shattered militarily. The travel ban, thank goodness, is fully in effect. Jerusalem has been recognized as the capital of Israel, Trump finally gets that done. A major Mideast peace plan is on the way, that is what they promised. That is a lot to be thankful for.</p><p>And you may not hear that on some of the other broadcasts. They like to focus on Mueller or Russia, Russia, Russia, but there are so many reasons to celebrate what the Trump administration is actually doing. Look past the tweets. Look past your animosity toward Republicans or conservatives. Think about where we were just a year ago and think about where we are today. They said the stock market was going to collapse. They said we were going to be isolationists and not deal with other countries. This said all this trade negotiation was never going to work. But my friends, it has been a very good year.</p><p>And up next. What is Melania Trump's favorite Christmas tradition?

Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this special report. Fair, balanced, and unafraid. Make it a great weekend. Take some time off. Here is Martha.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good advice. Thank you, Bret. Good to see you tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All right, breaking just moments ago, we just received word that Bernie Sanders -- Senator Bernie Sanders, candidate for the nominee for Democratic Party has been released from a Nevada hospital. But they did confirm that candidate Sanders did suffer a heart attack and that was what led to his admission to a Nevada hospital.</p><p>They put two stents into Senator Sanders and he is doing well, according to all the reports and has been released. But confirming that what sent him there originally was indeed a heart attack. We'll keep you posted as developments come in on that this evening.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And also breaking tonight, Rudy Giuliani responding to the latest in the impeachment probe. President Trump trying to convince the country that it is corruption and not politics that led him to insist that the new Ukraine leader look into the Bidens.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Everything to me is about corruption. We want to find out what happens with 2016. And as you know, there's a lot of work going on to that. I don't care about Biden's campaign but I do care about corruption.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, that is the message of the day coming from the White House and from the Trump campaign. Just remember the key part -- one key part of the Trump-Zelensky phone call in which President Trump said, \"Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you could look into it, it sounds horrible to me,\" he said.</p><p>And then, President Zelensky says, \"The next prosecutor will be 100 percent, my person. He or she will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.</p><p>And then today, we have a new prosecutor in Ukraine. He has announced that he will be doing exactly that. He will reopen the Burisma case and several other cases that have been dismissed when Joe Biden successfully got the previous prosecutor fired. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSLAN RIABOSHAPKA, PROSECUTOR GENERAL OF UKRAINE (through translator): We are now reviewing all the cases that were closed or split into several parts, or were investigated before, in order to be able to rule to reverse those cases where illegal procedural steps were taken.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, the new prosecutor, says he is doing all of this absolutely on his own. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIABOSHAPKA: Not a single foreign or Ukrainian official or politician has called me, or tried to influence my decisions regarding specific criminal cases.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, that could be big news. Rudy Guiliani also is saying tonight that this was not about 2020, but a corrupt Biden legacy, he says that he was looking into long before Joe Biden decided to run.</p><p>He sat down with me earlier to try to convince everyone that this is all about corruption and not about 2020 politics. You listen and decide.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACCALLUM: What's your reaction to the fact that they have -- that this new prosecutor has been put in place and they decide to reopen these cases including Burisma?</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank God. I mean, the fact is that this case was closed in October of 2016, right before the presidential election of -- by pressure from Joe Biden, bribe to Poroshenko.</p><p>If they reopen it and they do a thorough investigation, it may lead right to the president of Ukraine, who allegedly may have been paid something for doing this. He was paid a lot for a lot of things, and they know that they ran against him.</p><p>But the reality is that this has to be investigated. And what Democrats have been doing for 2-1/2 -- three years is covering it up. And a lot of what they're doing with this impeachment thing is to cover up Biden. There's a couple of steps.</p><p>Biden gets the prosecutor Shokin, fired.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Right.</p><p>GIULIANI: The new prosecutor comes in and he does three corrupt things. He dismisses the Soros case, he dismisses the Biden case a couple of months later, and he dismisses the Burisma case.</p><p>The only thing I know by knew is that it was going to dismiss the Burisma case. But it had the effect of dismissing the other case as well. Frankly, I don't think Biden knew it. But I can't exclude it, it's never been investigated.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right.</p><p>GIULIANI: But because he did it, maybe on purpose, maybe inadvertently, he cut off all kinds of evidence that would have explained the Steele dossier and made it probably impossible to ever have Mueller. Because it would have been started -- it started to be revealed in 2016. And you would have seen Glenn Simpson, you would have seen some of the false stuff attributed to Russia. Remember, Steele was never in Russia. These people told me how stupid are you people.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, we heard from Kurt Volker yesterday was that he has also been around a long time -- spent a lot of time in Ukraine. He says that Joe Biden never did anything wrong.</p><p>GIULIANI: He wouldn't know that.</p><p>MACCALLUM: He said -- I'm just telling you what he said. This is an eight-page transcript that he just put out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: Yes, but --</p><p>MACCALLUM: He said that he believed that you were being spun in the Ukraine and that they were leading you to believe that there was -- you know, things going on that weren't going on, and that, that is what you ended up putting into this document, and hope that we all just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: I've -- I</p><p>MACCALLUM: Hold on, I let you talk, I want -- I just only ask you this so that you can --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: I get that. Yes, please.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So that you can respond to it. And that he also wanted to make -- he was concerned that some of what you were pursuing was going to make it look like Ukraine was not only involved in 2016, which I think everybody understands the desire to look into 2016. But that he didn't want it to appear in any way.</p><p>If they started looking into Biden again that the Ukraine was also -- Ukraine, excuse me, also trying to get involved in 2020. He was very concerned that there might be that confluence that would really reflect badly on this new government that wanted reform.</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, well, Kurt never said that to me, ever.</p><p>MACCALLUM: It's all in his transcript. I just telling what he said.</p><p>GIULIANI: You had said it to me. I don't know what's in his transcript, he never said to me. Now, here's why Kurt is wrong. Kurt, first of all, with all due respect, he's a great diplomat. He doesn't know anything about investigating, he doesn't know anything about crime. Kurt never investigated it.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, he's a diplomat.</p><p>GIULIANI: But he never investigated.</p><p>MACCALLUM: That's what he does.</p><p>GIULIANI: If he had said that to me, you know, the first thing I've asked, it was, show me the investigation.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes.</p><p>GIULIANI: They never investigated. They are taking the word of people who have an interest in covering it up, and they're not investigating it. I asked for only one thing from them. I don't ask for a result, I ask for an investigation.</p><p>For three years, these very dramatic allegations of corruption have not been investigated. And I beg to differ about Biden being 2020. Biden did what he did from 2014 to 2016. He did it as vice president of the United States.</p><p>Let's just say it's true, then, it's one of the major sellouts by a vice president in the history of our country. How could a president of the United States not want that investigated?</p><p>Remember, this all started and our desire to have it investigated goes back to November of 2018. It ended -- my investigation ended in March of 2018. Go look at the documents. I investigated this for a sole purpose of defending Donald Trump.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I've heard this (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GIULIANI: I want it investigated for the sole purpose of Donald Trump. And at the time that I did it, Martha, I got to -- I got to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: It's because you think that the Biden's move --</p><p>GIULIANI: I got -- I got to finish the final thought because it's one of the reasons why they are lying.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Go ahead.</p><p>GIULIANI: At the time I began this investigation and at the time I ended it, he was not a presidential candidate. In November of 2018, when the first --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: But he is now.</p><p>GIULIANI: But, how did I know that in November 2018 and tell me why -- tell me why --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: No, I understand what you're saying. I'm saying that the concern is that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: But -- no, but the concern is fraudulent, the concern is political spin. How would I say as a lawyer, in 2018 that they're explaining to me how the crime that my client is being investigated for was committed by others? And the vice president of the United States committed a very big crime.</p><p>I'm supposed to say, I'm not going to investigate that because Joe Biden is sitting at home, thinking of running for the president of the United States two years later? Isn't that ridiculous?</p><p>MACCALLUM: I understand. No, I think it's a good point, and I understand what you're saying. I want to look -- I (INAUDIBLE) for one of these --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: But they are covering up -- the Democrats are covering up corruption. Massive corruption.</p><p>MACCALLUM: But don't you understand -- don't you understand, people at the situation -- that people say, you know, I understand completely that you want to look into and Bill Barr wants to look into, and the president wants to look into, and the president wants to look into the origins of the 2016 investigation.</p><p>GIULIANI: And what about Joe Biden's corruption in 2016.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Everybody, everybody want (INAUDIBLE). OK, but I -- but that triggers something different.</p><p>GIULIANI: Yes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: He is running for president against the current president, President Trump.</p><p>GIULIANI: OK.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And it triggers concerns that what is being requested is a little bit of a dig to open this.</p><p>GIULIANI: It does. OK.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Everybody knows that the Hunter Biden situation is very sensitive. It's something that was absolutely going to come up during the course of this one, as you say.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: It's not sensitive, it's very corrupt. It's not sensitive. It's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, there are different elements to the Hunter-Biden story. OK, and you know that, that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: Yes, but you have to be naive.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right, listen.</p><p>GIULIANI: You have to be naive not to think the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right, listen. All right, I've been -- I've been saying I'm going to bring up these text messages, this is from July 25th. Kurt Volker --</p><p>GIULIANI: July -- I'm sorry, the date -- I got it (INAUDIBLE) to when I got involved.</p><p>MACCALLUM: July 25 -- July 25, Kurt Volker to Andrey Yermak, who is associate of Zelensky.</p><p>GIULIANI: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Right, exactly. Kurt Volker, says, \"Good lunch, thanks. Heard from White House, assuming President Zelensky convinces Trump he will investigate, get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down a date for a visit in Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow.\"</p><p>So that's all --</p><p>GIULIANI: That's very good.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You're happy with that.</p><p>GIULIANI: Does it say 2016?</p><p>MACCALLUM: This is -- yes, absolutely.</p><p>GIULIANI: It doesn't say 2020.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Then it goes on --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: Martha, it doesn't say President Trump wants you to interfere in the 2020 election. It says President Trump wants you to investigate substantial allegations of federal crimes, partially committed in the Ukraine by high-level American officials. Exactly, what an honest president should do and exactly what Obama didn't do five years ago that could have stopped the whole thing.</p><p>MACCALLUM: One thing that you guys have absolutely succeeded in doing is pushing this to the forefront and I think that it will. It already is flashing out this question. You should be delighted, as I -- you said you are because now, the prosecutor is going to do another 15 minutes -- 15 cases.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: We haven't even started -- we haven't even started. I'm going to tell you another thing I never did. I never investigated China for the very reason that you criticize me for investigating China. Because you may think the link --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: I didn't criticize you with regards to China.</p><p>GIULIANI: No, no, you would, I mean, they would -- that the media would criticize me. Look, I'm getting criticized for investigating a situation in which he put himself. I didn't pay the bribe. I didn't know about Joe Biden when they says information was given to me. I'm being criticized for investigating that.</p><p>Imagine if I started investigating China? I know I could prove China.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Have you looked into China.</p><p>GIULIANI: I have not investigated China?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Have you talked to people in China about Joe Biden?</p><p>GIULIANI: So, I convicted --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>GIULIANI: I convicted the commissioner of the mafia, 1,000 mafia members,</p><p>MACCALLUM: What an amazing resume.</p><p>GIULIANI: (INAUDIBLE). 200 crooked politicians, Democrats, and Republicans. Would you give me credit for having a nose for corruption and crime? I can --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: I absolutely give you a credit for having a nose for corruption and crime.</p><p>GIULIANI: I can smell it. I can smell it. Here is what I smell. China is a bigger sellout than Ukraine. I can prove it. And the Democratic Party is scared out of their minds because this pay per plays game doesn't just involve Biden.</p><p>The big questions that has to be asked is in 2015, when The New York Times first exposed the enormous conflict that Biden had in Ukraine, and criticize him -- how could you have your son taking money from a corrupt oligarch and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Anyway, he was asked about that many times.</p><p>GIULIANI: Why didn't Obama stop it? Any honest president would've stop it.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know, if there's -- if there indications that they were concerned in the Obama White House about it, that they talk to him about it several times that they didn't want to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: Why didn't he stop it? Why?</p><p>MACCALLUM: That they didn't want to step in.</p><p>GIULIANI: Why?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Maybe they wish they had.</p><p>GIULIANI: Wish they have no sense of (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MACCALLUM: Maybe they wish they had. But let me ask you something. So, you're suggesting that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: Wait, it is -- is this very similar to Hillary and Clinton Foundation?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, let me just stay with this for one moment. You --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: Is it similar to Hillary and Clinton Foundation?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Is -- absolutely there are parallels. Absolutely.</p><p>GIULIANI: We start to see a pattern now?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Perhaps. I'm not going to read anything into --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: Is it possible -- is it possible if we break this open, we're going to find out the Obama administration might be one of the more corrupt administrations in a very long -- is it possible?</p><p>MACCALLUM: We will see. I mean, we're going to follow -- we'll follow (INAUDIBLE). Does it bother you?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: And is it possible that Democrats -- is it possible that Democrats cover that up and fight for their lives? And have Schiff going out violating laws in order to frame the president of the United States?</p><p>And make no mistake about it. The president of the United States is extremely serious, and there are lawyers working on it right now about suing those guys directly, individually.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You said that, yes.</p><p>GIULIANI: And not a -- not a joke, not a threat, it's a difficult legal endeavor. And we've got lawyers working on it as we speak. And thank you, Schiff, because you keep lying every day. He knew about the whistleblower.</p><p>MACCALLUM: We reported that.</p><p>GIULIANI: And even lied about it for four weeks?</p><p>MACCALLUM: We reported that. Let me ask you this. I guess a lot of people look at the situation from the State Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: Schiff, keep talking.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Let me ask you a question. From the State Department to -- you know, all of these diplomats who have a lot of experience in Ukraine and spent many years there, who have feel very differently about this situation than you do. That they don't see under the rocks what you see under the rocks.</p><p>GIULIANI: Maybe if they had seen under the rocks what I see under the rocks, it wouldn't be going on with Ukraine.</p><p>MACCALLUM: They -- maybe it would, and maybe you're going to fix it all. And maybe you're going to fix it all. But my question is why --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: And I really -- I'm not going to say I'm going to fix it, maybe Donald Trump is going to fix it all because he's a disruptive president who knows how to break up the swamp.</p><p>Rudy Giuliani is not going to fix it. Donald Trump is going to fix it. And the reason he's president of United States, and they are just walking around with their suits on, and haven't done damn thing about corruption in Ukraine, except to contribute to it.</p><p>Do you know what they say in the Ukraine when we talk about corruption? They say, bull. You had Joe Biden pulling down (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Oh, I'm sure they do. I mean, they --</p><p>GIULIANI: They think with the biggest hypocrite. Don't you think an American president has to crack that open?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Let me ask you something.</p><p>GIULIANI: And do you think he's going to crack it open with the very diplomats that couldn't find it in the first place.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, maybe President Trump is going to solve all the corruption in Ukraine and you are going to --</p><p>GIULIANI: No, he's not. He's got to solve the American corruption.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You just said he was. You said I'm not going to do it, he is going to do it.</p><p>GIULIANI: The American corruption has to be solved.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You just said that I was just repeating what you say. So, a lot of people look at the situation and they say, what exactly are doing in this situation? There's a state department, we have ambassadorial level that -- that's involve in all of this. Why are you, the president's personal attorney, what is your personal mission? What's your mission?</p><p>GIULIANI: Wow! To disrupt the world. My mission is to defend my client, and the best traditions of the legal profession. It would give you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, it's in the interest of your client to find out what happened with Joe Biden and Burisma, not the country.</p><p>GIULIANI: No, no. Please, that's a mischaracterization, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Will you tell me?</p><p>GIULIANI: It's in the best interest of my client to unravel a corruption in the Ukraine, which will involve mostly collusion in the election, into which Joe Biden inserted himself.</p><p>MACCALLUM: It isn't that what Bill Barr is doing? Isn't that his job and the Justice Department?</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, Bill Barr wasn't there when I was doing it.</p><p>MACCALLUM: What is different from your role and Bill Barr's role? Can you answer that?</p><p>GIULIANI: There was no Bill Barr when I did it.</p><p>MACCALLUM: What is the difference between what you're currently doing?</p><p>GIULIANI: Did you hear what I just said? There was no Bill Barr --</p><p>MACCALLUM: You started before he did, I get it. I get it.</p><p>GIULIANI: Bill Barr wasn't there. I started the investigation on November 2018.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You said -- no, I understand all of that.</p><p>GIULIANI: I ended the investigation in March of 2018. Every fact that I have goes back to then. How could it possibly be to affect the 2020 election? How would I have known back then that he was going to run?</p><p>And why would I have not investigated him as he was central to the whole story, and they gave it to me? I was going to say, no. Take the Biden thing, put it aside because the American and press will attack me if I go after that.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I got -- well, you know what? It's going to be very -- I mean, we, we have covered it and we continue to cover it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: But I'm very disparaged that somebody has to be examined why this wasn't stopped in 2015 because it could have been stopped then --</p><p>MACCALLUM: You're doing it. You're doing it.</p><p>GIULIANI: -- if we had an honest president.</p><p>MACCALLUM: OK. Congressman Will Hurd who also served as an undercover officer for the Central Intelligence Agency responds to the Rudy Giuliani interview coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: What is your personal mission? What's your mission?</p><p>GIULIANI: To disrupt the world. My mission is to defend my client in the best traditions of the legal profession. If I were defending a terrorist, and I would -- I would go in to ask questions of world leaders that would prove that the terrorists was innocent or being tortured, the ACLU --</p><p>MACCALLUM: So it's in the interest of your client to find out what happened with Joe Biden and Burisma, not the country.</p><p>GIULIANI: No, no, please -- that's a mischaracterization, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, you tell me.</p><p>GIULIANI: It's in the best interest of my client to unravel the corruption in Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: OK. Here now Texas Congressman Will Hurd, a former undercover CIA agent who now sits on the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight.</p><p>REP. WILL HURD (R-TX): Good evening.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So the message of that is that it is not about politics according to Mr. Giuliani, it's all about their deep desire to root out the deep corruption in the Ukraine and also as it extends, he believes to the Democratic Party.</p><p>And his argument for why Joe Biden is relevant to the larger corruption pictures that because he fired the prosecutor and all those other cases fell away, one of those other cases may have led to the big 2016 corruption that he is seeking. How does all that sit with you? What do you think about that?</p><p>HURD: Well, that's a lot to unpack there.</p><p>MACCALLUM: It is.</p><p>HURD: And I think that's one of the reasons that we should be having these hearings at the -- at the House Intelligence Committee. We should -- let's start with the whistleblower. I think we should be protecting the whistleblower because they made some allegations, and the just that allegations about wrongdoing that we should pursue.</p><p>And I think Mayor Giuliani's perspective on this and understanding what he's doing and what does disrupting the world actually mean, and how is he going about doing that is important perspective. I also want to hear from Hunter Biden. His name is being thrown around a lot. What actually did he do? And we should have that in front of the committee.</p><p>I wish the Chairman Schiff was doing this in a way to try to uncover the truth, rather than, you know, trying to end with some preconceived notions. But I think the way the Senate is trying to move forward on this investigation and understand what really went on, what happened, what did the Ukrainians actually believe, so we can ultimately put this to bed.</p><p>Because I wish we were talking about how are we working with Ukraine to push out the Russians. The Russians invaded that country, right? That's the whole reason we're having these conversations. And that's where I think we should be talking about U.S. foreign policy, to show the rest of the world that if the Russians did something like that again, we would be - - we would be there to back people up.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So you said you'd like to hear from Rudy Giuliani. Will you -- would you be asking him to come before the committee and answer your questions?</p><p>HURD: I believe the majority of the House Intelligence Committee have already asked for him to show up. I don't know that -- I don't get a say and who shows up. That's determined by Chairman Schiff. And I'm sure Mayor Giuliani is one of the people that is going to ultimately be on that list.</p><p>There's a lot more folks from the State Department, because part of the concern here is a private citizen, you know, pushing forward with U.S. foreign policy. What actually happened? Give some context to the call from July 25. There's a lot of questions.</p><p>MACCALLUM: But you know, in his answer to that as far as I can tell, is that he believes that he's the only person who can do it, that he has contacts and that he's going to uncover all of this corruption.</p><p>And that you know, the fact that that the Ukraine government -- the prior Ukraine government said that they had exonerated or not found any illegality in Burisma or in the Biden connection, doesn't matter to him at all, because he says, you know, that whole government was corrupt so we got to start over. And that's actually what they're doing right now.</p><p>HURD: Well, we may invite you to come and participate in the hearing to unpack some of those things and get to the -- get to the bottom of some of these answers. But yes, there were already several investigations into a number of these countries. We know that there is corruption in Ukraine, trying to understand that. The US government has participated and worked with the Ukrainian government on this issue.</p><p>But again, trying to make sure that we understand it -- and the role of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is to understand those allegations made by the whistleblower. And some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to see everything as you know, lens for impeachment, others want to see as a total exoneration. I want to see -- let's get to the truth --</p><p>MACCALLUM: That would be nice.</p><p>HURD: -- and then we can move forward.</p><p>MACCALLUM: That would be helpful. Thank you very much, Congressman Hurd. Good to see you tonight. Thanks for being here.</p><p>HURD: Always a pleasure.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You bet. So House Republicans blasting Intel Chair Adam Schiff tonight over his panel's reported contact with the whistleblower who sparked this whole impeachment frenzy. And they're not the only ones. Even the Washington Post tonight slamming Adam Schiff for making flat out false comments. Trey Gowdy up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to. But I'm sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised as the law requires by the Inspector General or the Director of National Intelligence just as to how he has to communicate with Congress. And so the risk of the whistleblower is retaliation.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So those comments from Adam Schiff a few weeks back landing in the House Intel Chair in some water -- hot water. The Washington Post gave him four Pinocchio's. They call the claim that his committee has not spoken to the whistleblower a flat out lie.</p><p>Kimberly Strassel also took up the issue in the Wall Street Journal, asking, if the public can't trust Mr. Schiff to be honest about the origins of his information, why should they trust his claim that the information itself is serious? It's a good question.</p><p>Here now Trey Gowdy, former House Oversight Committee Chairman and now a Fox News contributor. Trey Good evening to you. Good to see you tonight. So what do you think about the Pinocchio's?</p><p>TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think he got four only because you can't get five. I mean, he got the maximum sentence you could get from the Washington Post fact checker and don't you know how hard that was for the Washington Post to give Adam Schiff four Pinocchio's?</p><p>MACCALLUM: But they did to their credit.</p><p>GOWDY: But they just made it up. Look, the second sound of the Apocalypse when that happen. So, I've got to get my affairs and order. But, yes, kudos to them for pointing out that Adam Schiff totally made something up. But he's also a career offender, Martha.</p><p>So same guy who had the parity, a week or so ago, the same guy that says he has evidence that even Mueller couldn't find. The question I have is how long Speaker Pelosi is going to put up with Adam mishandling this investigation. She's already taken it away from Jerry Nadler. I'm sure the guys and gals --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: That's true.</p><p>GOWDY: -- on the judiciary committee are not happy about having Adam Schiff. But if you are going to do it, at least don't screw it up, Adam. And right now, he's made himself a fact witness. He is in the evidentiary chain for what happened with this whistleblower and I hope the Republicans make him testify.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, he easily could've answered that question honestly, and you know, and said yes, he came to our office, we put him through the proper channels, or heard through the proper channels. You know, why do you think he didn't? I mean, does it say something about deeper involvement on his part? What does that reveal, that he wasn't willing to say that, I wonder?</p><p>GOWDY: In the words of Patty Loveless, that he's got a little trouble with the truth to quote a country song. I mean, why does anybody lie, because they are afraid the truth is going to get them in trouble. Schiff has received a pass -- the whole time I was in Congress, I don't ever remember a negative word about him.</p><p>I remember him complaining Republicans would meet with whistleblowers. I remember him complaining when Republicans would ever meet with witnesses and he wasn't present. So, this is the third mistake he's made -- and may be the most major investigation he's ever going to be part of. I don't know how long Nancy Pelosi is going to put up with these missteps.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, what's the impact of that? What's the impact on the case? You know, how difficult is it that the lead person on this is making these missteps. How serious is it for the whole big picture?</p><p>GOWDY: How damning was it that Mark Fuhrman investigated O.J. Simpson's murder? How damning was it that Peter Strzok was the lead investigator --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Very.</p><p>GOWDY: -- bias or the perception of bias. I'm not prejudging Mark Fuhrman. I will m prejudge Peter Strzok. Bias kills investigations. And for anyone who wondered whether or not Adam Schiff could be objective and dispassionate, I never wondered that. But if any of your viewers did, now you know he makes up facts and openings and he lie about meeting with a whistleblower when the truth would've served him just fine. He just decided to lie about it.</p><p>MACCALLUM: This is a sound -- piece of sound from Susan Rice who says that there is an attack on democracy coming from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Listen to this and I want to get your opinion to it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUSAN RICE, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: For the first time that I can remember, our democracy is under assault. Our country is in effect under attack.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You write that in your book, but you still believe.</p><p>RICE: And that attack -- that attack is coming now from within. It's coming from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>RICE: And for all the security threats I saw as national security advisor, all the challenges we face, I never thought I'd see that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: What do you think of that?</p><p>GOWDY: I think that might be the same Susan Rice that went on the Fox Sunday morning talk shows and botch every single fact about what happened in Benghazi, Libya to four of our fellow citizens. I think it's the same Susan Rice who threatened to run against Susan Collins because she had the unmitigated temerity to vote for Brett Kavanaugh for U.S. Supreme Court justice.</p><p>The biggest threat we have to our democracy is when people who don't like Trump and didn't vote for him want to undermine and reverse election results. That's what's going to do with (Inaudible) in a Republic.</p><p>Look, she didn't vote for Trump. I feel really confident saying that. She didn't vote for him, but you still have to respect the fact that lots and lots of people did and he won the electoral college to say that that is a threat to democracy because you happen to disagree with someone? The threat is when you undermine the election by trying to impeach and get rid of someone simply because you wish they weren't in office.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. Wise words. Thank you very much, Trey. Good to see you tonight.</p><p>GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. You too.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, coming up next, the Supreme Court will soon take up an abortion case for the first time with Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the bench. Governor Mike Huckabee joins us with his thoughts on that big move tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Roe v. Wade. Are you familiar with the case?</p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT: I am, senator.</p><p>GRAHAM: Just how the system works, can you sit down with you and four other judges and overrule Roe v. Wade just because you want to?</p><p>KAVANAUGH: Sir, Roe v. Wade is an important precedent to the Supreme Court, been reaffirm --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRAHAM: Don't you have to have a case, I mean, you just can't.</p><p>KAVANAUGH: Yes.</p><p>GARHAM: What are you doing for lunch, let's overdo Roe v. Wade.</p><p>KAVANAUGH: I --</p><p>GRAHAM: It doesn't work that way, right?</p><p>KAVANAUGH: I see what you're asking, Senator. Right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So now for the first time since Justice Kavanaugh and Gorsuch have joined the Supreme Court the high court is about to take up the question of abortion over a Louisiana law that requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 miles of their clinic.</p><p>Supporters say that the law is about keeping women's safe. Opponents say that it will leave that state with only one abortion clinic. It is the first abortion case that the high courts are going to hear with this new majority in place, will the decision likely come four months before the presidential election. We will see you.</p><p>Here now Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor and Fox News contributor. Good to see you this evening, Governor.</p><p>This is going to be interesting with the configuration of this court and the question that will be before them is whether or not having this rule that stipulates that these doctors have to have admitting privileges at the hospital that's not too far away supersedes the issue that it would limit the entire state to only one abortion clinic in a state where abortion is legal, and the federal law that says that abortion is legal.</p><p>FMR. GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE (R-AR): Well, first of all, it doesn't outlaw abortion. I wish it did. I'd love to see abortion a thing of the past, I'd like to see it go away with slavery. That's something that we stopped doing when we got civilized enough to realize how barbaric this practice is. But that's not what this case will do.</p><p>It doesn't even say that there will be one abortion clinic, there may be one that meets this criteria, but it's a criteria that should be met. Martha, this is a serious surgical procedure.</p><p>I'm amazed that women don't insist that the abortion clinics have the most sophisticated medical equipment available and that the doctors who perform these procedures should be licensed and should be required to be licensed to have admitting privileges at a hospital in case something goes wrong, which is something does. And women do die in these clinics.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know, given -- absolutely. And I think the more medical care that's close by in these situations, you wanted to be as rare as possible but the safer it is. But it obviously raises these broader questions in a country where abortion at this moment in time is legal, and as you said you'd like to see it a completely overturned.</p><p>The Planned Parenthood today put out this statement. \"The Supreme Court just announced that it will take up a case which could decide the future of abortion access in this country. Our right to safe, legal abortion hangs in the balance.\"</p><p>So, for them they clearly feel that the big question is on the table here. Do you think it is or do you think that the court sort of finds a way to push that kind of decision off into the future?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, the court needs to decide whether or not abortion clinics ought to have to have the same kind of medical requirements that, let's say, Botox clinic or a plastic surgery clinic or even some dental clinics have to have depending on the procedures that they do where the people performing the procedures have to have --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- medical admitting privileges.</p><p>Again, it doesn't get rid of abortion. I think if Planned Parenthood is so intent on it and apparently, they are, then they should make sure that the doctors are certified, that they have access to hospitals, and that they can admit.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. We'll see.</p><p>HUCKABEE: The abortion issue, Martha, is ultimately going to be settled when we decide on the personhood of the unborn child, not whether or not the doctor has admitting privileges to a hospital.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, that's a good point.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But this would be one step to protect those women.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And when that question comes to the Supreme Court, it's going to be a historic moment on all sides, to be sure.</p><p>This was a very interesting moment. I mean, this to me is one of the big stories of the week, it seems like. Obviously, there's a lot of big stories out there this week. But this judge, Tammy Kemp, walked over to this woman, Amber Guyger, who has a -- is headed to jail for 10 years for the killing of a man who lived in an apartment nearby her. She shot him twice.</p><p>The judge handed her a bible. An Atheist group came out and said, \"It is perfectly acceptable for private citizens to express their religious beliefs in court but the rules are different for those acting in a governmental role. We believe that our criminal justice system needs more compassion from judges but here compassion cross the line into coercion.\"</p><p>What do you say about that?</p><p>HUCKABEE: That group needs to get a grip and a life because they don't have either one. Here's what I would say to them. If you'd like to provide a book, go ahead and tell us which one you like to provide to that person.</p><p>I was grateful that the judge decided that there was a role for both justice and mercy in the same courtroom and that's what she exhibited and I thought it was powerful. And right after that incredible moment that I think brought the entire nation to tears --</p><p>MACCALLUM: I did too.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- where the brother of the victim asked to hug the person who killed her brother and embraced her. We need more of that.</p><p>MACCALLUM: We sure do.</p><p>HUCKABEE: We need to see God's grace in action. And I just don't know what this group possibly can see wrong with the judge, again extending both arms of both justice and mercy at the same time.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, I agree.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Thank God for her.</p><p>MACCALLUM: It is a beautiful human moment that we need to see a lot more of in this country and they set an example for all of us in that courtroom this week. It's good to see you, governor. Thank you very much.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Thank you, Martha. Have a great weekend.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You too. So, Hillary Clinton getting very candid this week with a stunning confession about her personal life.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: I think the gutsiest thing I've done -- well, personally, make the decision to stay in my marriage.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Wow, a special edition of ladies' night with the women of Fox Business Network coming up next.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, the day after President Trump was elected, economist Paul Krugman made this prediction. He said, still I guess people want an answer. If the answer is when will the markets recover, a first pass answer is never. Never.</p><p>So, here's what happened. The Dow was up nearly 45 percent. The S&amp;P up 38 percent. The NASDAQ -- look at that, up 53 percent since President Trump was elected and on top of that you've got unemployment at a 50-year low, 3.5 percent.</p><p>So, now, nearly three years later, Krugman is out with another prediction, warning people to prepare now for the coming Trump slump. \"He may well be the first president,\" he says, \"of modern times to preside over a slump that can be directly attributed to his own policies rather than bad luck.\"</p><p>Join me now, three of my colleagues from Fox Business which had a big refresh this week, we've got beautiful pictures of them all over the building outside. Cheryl Casone, Susan Li, and Kristina Partsinevelos. Great to have all of you with us.</p><p>You know, I'm not sure why anybody listens to Paul Krugman. He's made a lot of really false assessments --</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Yes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: -- of where things are going, so I'm not sure that's the best stop. I would stop at Fox Business, personally. But what do you think?</p><p>CASONE: Well, look he made some interesting points in that piece in the New York Times. He isn't wrong that, yes, no president can really take full 100 percent credit for great economy or bad economy. That's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. Everybody knows that. That's no revelation.</p><p>CASONE: But Wall Street is not red or blue. But, frankly, let's be honest too. The markets as the numbers just prove they wanted a business person --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: -- in that chair, in that seat, and they got it. And remember, look at all the regulations that he's rolled back, look at the pro-business policies, look at the tax reforms --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, definitely.</p><p>CASONE: -- the companies to go out and hire and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: They love the president - small business, I can tell you.</p><p>CASONE: -- and grow up.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I've talked to a lot of business owners who are very enthusiastic. You know, another thing that I think is interesting is I spoke to -- I speak to folks on Wall Street who say that they think the market has factored in a Trump win. Do you think that?</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Seventy-five percent of the market actually expects him to win in 2020.</p><p>MACCALLUM: That's pretty remarkable given the polls --</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: -- and everything else, Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, you actually see the action when Warren starts to lead, there is a sell-off because they believe that she'll roll back a lot of those regulations that you talk about.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Which she's been pretty clear she would.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Exactly.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: And especially go after big tech which is why you see a lot of reaction in the technology sector but as a whole, I think that Cheryl pointed really aptly that with his -- the economy doing great. The only concern though is this trade war and that would be the self-inflicted wound --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Definitely.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: -- because business investments wouldn't increase.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, definitely. All right. Let's move on to some juicy topics of the night. Let's play this Hillary Clinton's thought which shocked her own daughter Chelsea. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: I think the gutsiest thing I ever done -- well, personally, make the decision to stay in my marriage.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Chelsea, how about you?</p><p>CHEALSEA CLINTON, HILLARY CLINTON'S DAUGHTER: No. Goodness, I think I'm so overwhelmed by my mother's answer that I'm a bit out of words.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: I can tell one of the most real movement that I've ever seen from Hillary Clinton.</p><p>CASONE: To be honest with you --</p><p>MACCALLUM: I thought it was very, very interesting.</p><p>CASONE: I mean, I think that is it really a normal marriage though? That's a political marriage and it's been that way for decades.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I don't think that's fair of anyone to say honestly. I mean, I don't know. Who knows what goes on --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: Who knows what's going on?</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know what I mean?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Yes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: But I just think that, you know, I think it does take guts to stay in a marriage that has been through that and I think a lot of women would say well you should walk away, you know what I mean, you got trampled on.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Yes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And you should walk away. But the very courageous tougher choice, Susan, is to stay.</p><p>LI: Is to stay. Forty-four years of marriage and we've all been through personal trauma, right, and personal difficulties.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes.</p><p>LI: But to be able to withstand that in the public of disdain and scrutiny as well, I thought that was really honestly very truthful and vulnerable of Clinton.</p><p>MACCALLUM: What do you think, Kristina?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: I agree and I think that could be one part, gutsy, because she was lied too personally by her partner and then in front of the public.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: However, it could -- and this may sound crass, it could come as self-serving because she knew that one day she too would run --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Maybe.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: -- as a politician, as a president candidate -- presidential candidate. Who is going to vote for a divorcee? That's the --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. You know, I know a lot of people think it's not a real marriage. And like I said to you, Cheryl, I mean, it's not an uncommon assessment. I think it's a very strong political partnership, to be sure --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: It's a partnership and a friendship, I think.</p><p>MACCALLUM: But I think there is something there.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know, I think there are some people who, you know, really do horrible things to each other, like, have on some level have like this deep connection, and I remember reading a book about them that they talk to each other three hours on the phone every single day no matter where they are.</p><p>I think that they have a mind meld that goes beyond, you know, the normal - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Forty-four years.</p><p>MACCALLUM: -- kind of thing or marriage. Yes. So, I mean, here I am like that. I'm a marriage therapist, but that's just my personal assessment.</p><p>CASONE: Well, they have a a great daughter, I will say that. I think Chelsea is very impressive.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. They do. They do. I mean, and you know, I think that this whole thing is probably part of maybe her political future. We'll see.</p><p>Meghan Markle. Holy cow -- this letter, she writes this heartfelt letter to her father who, you know, everybody knows is just like talk to every tabloid about her and she's begging her father the person who brought her into the world, please, dad, back off. \"I pleased with you to stop reading the tabloids on a daily basis. You are fixated and clicked on the lies that they were writing about me.\"</p><p>And goes on to say, \"especially those manufactured by your other daughter who I barely know. You watch me silently suffer at the hands of vicious lies and I crumbled inside.\"</p><p>I mean, what's next for this one.</p><p>CASONE: Well, and Prince Harry is coming out. I mean, they are now suing the tabloids --</p><p>MACCALLUM: That's right.</p><p>CASONE: The Mail. Good for Prince Harry --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: As they should.</p><p>CASONE: -- for getting there and supporting his wife and going after the British press. President Trump thinks that the American press is bad. Try the British tabloids.</p><p>MACCALLUM: They're brutal.</p><p>CASONE: They're brutal.</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And Prince Harry said, look, I saw this happened to my mother and I don't want to see this happen to my wife.</p><p>LI: But is this new to media scrutiny? I mean, isn't she an actress, isn't she used to the public -- to the public arena?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes.</p><p>LI: So, is she really that surprised that given that she's married what, to the fourth in line for the British crown, that this is what happens to her?</p><p>MACCALLUM: I mean, it happened to Fergie, it happened to Diana. You know, playing nicely nice doesn't sell a lot of magazines, I guess. Kristina?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: But she's a royal now, and royals are normally supposed to be quiet and you're not supposed to invade their privacy, and they're not supposed to talk out and go on tours. That's not the case with this relationship now.</p><p>But like you guys talked about. The British press is just crazy. They are so invasive. And so, this is good, it's good that they were going after them because it's not only this. Think of the hacking in the early 2000s, so it's not journalism.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, indeed. Let's put up this quick thought from President Trump today and we'll get a quick thought. Go ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Under the Me Too generation, we're not allowed to say it. So, all you young brilliant guys never, ever call a woman beautiful. Please. You're not allowed to do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: We've gotten to -- we've gotten too sensitive --</p><p>MACCALLUM: I agree.</p><p>CASONE: -- we've gotten too sensitive in this country. Come on.</p><p>MACCALLUM: We like to be called beautiful, don't you?</p><p>LI: Well, I like to be called beautiful. Women are beautiful. We celebrate that.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Exactly. Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Because I moves here a year and a half ago and I have to say, I'm Canadian. I would say that it's more P.C. here than I ever imagined.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I think you are all beautiful. All beautiful. All right. We got to leave at that. Thank you so much, ladies. Congratulations on the refresh, Fox Business.</p><p>LI: Thank you.</p><p>MACCALLUM: More of THE STORY coming up next.</p><p>MACCALLUM: That is THE STORY on this Friday, October 4, 2019. But as always, THE STORY goes on. Have a great weekend, everybody. I will see you back here on Monday at seven. Good night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019100401cb263</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6G-Y7B1-JB20-G1HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8181\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

But it does immediately become one of the highest priority items on the White House's already crowded to-do list. It's more than possible that with impeachment work, the smoldering conflict in Saudi Arabia, immigration and ICE issues, and innumerable other issues and legal challenges, something like social media regulation may simply not be important enough to actively pursue.<br/>The Trump administration has a complicated relationship with the tech industry. Many would say that it was the savvy leveraging of social media that helped the man get elected. And Trump has embraced Twitter so closely as to make it effectively the main instrument of his office. But he has also repeatedly lashed out against companies like Facebook and Google for a variety of reasons, often having to do with a perceived bias against him or conservatives in general.<br/>This summer, for example: In July the president said there \"may or may not be National Security concerns with regard to Google and their relationship with China.\" Then the next week he suggested Google had taken \"very illegal\" actions, specifically that they \"suppressed negative stories on Hillary Clinton, and boosted negative stories on Donald Ttump [sic].\" Shortly after that, he accused Google of having \"manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes\" in favor of Clinton in the 2016 election, saying \"Google should be sued.\"<br/>This is only a handful of examples, from a period of weeks. While these events individually appear to have occurred spontaneously in response to what the president was watching or being told at the time (for instance in the last case, Fox News had mentioned the report minutes earlier), they amount to a semi-organized collection of actions that in aggregate may have eventually been called policy.<br/>The multi-state investigation of potential antitrust violations by Google does not seem to in fact have been instigated by the White House, though the FTC and Department of Justice investigations were likely spurred by the Executive in some form or another.<br/>But Trump has also found himself at least notionally on the side of Big Tech elsewhere; for instance, on the question of privacy and user protection laws. States like Illinois have had highly robust laws in place for years that have proven a thorn in many a company's side. With California enacting its own, the industry decided that enough was enough, and has been calling loudly for federal intervention. The logic is that a federal law on the matter of, say, selling personally identifiable information to advertisers, would be more lenient and preempt state laws. And they are right not to expect anything of the scale or rigor of GDPR.<br/>While some of these machines are already in motion, the White House has yet to set others on their way - for example a puzzling rumored order that would have put the FCC in charge of regulating social media. Tech companies are likely breathing a sigh of relief at the thought that Trump's attention will be elsewhere as impeachment proceedings begin and blend into the 2020 election.<br/>Tech will remain at the center of many national debates and actions, but impeachment may very well have pushed these troublesome but ultimately not urgent efforts from the back burner and onto the floor.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-136562</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4M-6XJ1-DYDW-708J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 25, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And the post-debate polls showed Mr. Trump had good reason to be concerned: Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton were essentially tied in the polls going into the first debate, but she received a bump after each of the three face-to-face matchups....</p><p>After his performance in one of the debates was panned, Mr. Trump blamed a 'defective mic' and questioned whether it was done 'on purpose' to put him at a disadvantage.

Trump would become only the third president in US history to be impeached, along with Andrew Johnson  and Bill Clinton.  ( Richard Nixon resigned before his pending impeachment.)</p><p>House leaders appear to be on schedule to hold their Wednesday vote, with the judiciary committee releasing its report this morning on the two articles of impeachment - abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.</p><p>In the 658-page report, Democrats  on the judiciary committee accuse Trump of committing constitutional and criminal bribery by trying to press Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden  and the 2016 election as the country's military aid was held up.</p><p>\"Applying the constitutional definition of 'bribery' here, there can be little doubt that it is satisfied,\" the report reads. \"President Trump solicited President Zelensky for a 'favor' of great personal value to him; he did so corruptly; and he did so in a scheme to influence his own official actions respecting the release of military and security assistance and the offer of a White House meeting. Although President Trump's actions need not rise to the level of a criminal violation to justify impeachment, his conduct here was criminal.\"</p><p> Republicans  on the judiciary committee wrote a dissent to the report, arguing their Democratic counterparts had committed a grave mistep that could jeopardize future presidencies. The starkly different perspectives on Trump's actions toward Ukraine likely foreshadow the Wednesday impeachment vote, which is expected to fall almost entirely along party lines.</p><p>    Actors hold up flowers as they perform during a ceremony to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in Bastogne, Belgium.

The gathering will include 'senior administration officials along with representatives of a range of companies,' White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a press statement[1]. He did not name the companies who would be present. </p><p>The meeting comes shortly after 22 people were killed during a mass shooting[2] Saturday in El Paso, Texas. Trump pledged Wednesday to 'do something about' online hate, telling reporters outside the White House that he is 'concerned for any group of hate, I don't like it whether it's white supremacy or any other kind of supremacy.'(Article Continues Below Advertisement) The El Paso gunman posted a manifest on 8chan, an internet message board known for its anything-goes mentality with respect to how it govern's content. The portal is offline after security and hosting companies dropped the site. 8chan can still communicate with followers through a verified Twitter account. Trump received criticism in July for not inviting [3]tech companies to a summit that month discussing the extent of big tech's censorship of conservatives. Some of those who were invited believe Facebook, Google and other big tech companies should be broken up or more aggressively regulated.

President Donald Trump's top aides have scheduled a July 11 social media summit event, which aims to talk about the country's online environment, The Washington Post reported Tuesday. Some of those who are invited believe Facebook, Google, and other big tech companies should be broken up or more aggressively regulated. </p><p>'Bigtech needs to be held accountable for their actions, and the general public needs to be aware of what's going on,' Craig Strazzeri, chief marketing officer PragerU, told reporters. He believes PragerU, a conservative group that produces videos on political issues, was invited to discuss its current lawsuits[1] against Google.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Google suppressed PragerU's videos about Islam and guns, making it more difficult for people to find the group's content. One of the group's lawsuits claims YouTube's restrictions on Prager's content restricts the nonprofit's freedom of speech contrary to the California constitution, discriminates against Prager on a religious basis in violation of the state's civil rights act, and breaches of contract for violating YouTube's own terms of service.Pragerpreviouslyfiled suit against Google[2], YouTube's parent company,in federal court[3]. That suit lost at the district level and is currently pending on appeal before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The White House, which has not responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment, also invited other big tech critics to the summit. Conservative groups Media Research Center and the Heritage Foundation are among those who are attending, according to representatives with both groups. Brent Bozell, the co-founder of Media Research Center, previously[4] recently asked the Department of Justice to investigate Facebook, Google and Twitter.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) 'I applaud the DOJ for heeding our call. Online giants Google, Facebook and Twitter wield unprecedented power to shape public opinion and even directly influence elections,' Bozell said in June following reports suggesting the DOJ is considering ways to open antitrust probes against Google. House Democrats also opened[5] up investigations on the same month into big tech platforms. All of this comes as Trump is growing more frustrated with what he believes is conservative bias within Silicon Valley. He frequently criticizes Facebook,telling[6] his Twitter followers in March that he's looking into accusations of big tech censorship.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Accusations commonly levelled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long assertedtheir products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet \"offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.\"</p><p>Its members' platforms \"don't have a political ideology or political bias\",the group's presidentMichael Beckerman said in a statement.

In March, he signed an executive order requiring UScolleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding.</p><p>The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers. But critics called the order unnecessary.</p><p>The president himself was dealt a setback on Tuesday in his legal battle against Twitter, his favoured means of communicating. A federal appeals court in New York City ruledthe president cannotban critics from his Twitter account, saying the First Amendment calls for more speech, rather than less, on matters of public concern.</p><p>Donald Trump Tweets bizarre Democratic debate spoof video</p><p>Mr Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter. He has accused Twitter of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message\".</p><p>Thursday's conference raised questions about whether Mr Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.</p><p>Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Mr Trump's 2016 campaign.</p><p>A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress.

Voters will encounter long lines at the polls and struggle getting ballots through the mail. Ideally, of course, these voters will be Democrats.If Trump loses reelection in November, any whiff of problems will allow him to question the legitimacy of the results. He has even held up the specter of chaos to call for delaying the Nov. </p><p>3 election.'With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp;#38; FRAUDULENT Election in history,' he tweeted on July 30[2]. 'It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???'These problems are not inevitable. They are being encouraged by Trump, who has done all he can to make it harder for people to vote during the coronavirus pandemic. He has baselessly claimed that mail-in voting[3] is ripe for fraud and abuse (it isn't) and admitted to depriving the postal service of funds in order to make it harder for people to vote by mail.In a recent Fox News interview, Trump said that if they didn't get the billions that Democrats are requesting to help the post office stay afloat, 'that means you can't have universal mail-in voting[4] because you they're not equipped to have it.'The $25 billion that Democrats wanted to provide the post office was not exclusively for mail-in voting.Trump and his allies have been laying the groundwork to question the legitimacy of the November election results for months, raising the troubling question of what will happen if the election doesn't go the president's way. Trump may act like every other president and step aside graciously \u2015 but he certainly seems to be leaving the door open to something more sinister.'Is the president saying if he doesn't win this election that he will not accept the results unless he wins?' a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday.'The President has always said he'll see what happens and make a determination in the aftermath,' she replied[5].President Barack Obama warned voters on Wednesday that nothing less than the future of democracy is at stake in November.'[T]his president and those in power \u2014 those who benefit from keeping things the way they are \u2014 they are counting on your cynicism,' he said in his speech at the Democratic National Convention. 'They know they can't win you over with their policies. So they're hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote doesn't matter. ...This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that's what it takes to win.'A look at the comments Trump has made undermining whatever happens in November.'It will end up being a rigged election or they will never come out with an outcome. They'll have to do it again, and nobody wants that.' [8/18/20[6]]'[I]f we are waiting for one state [to count the votes] and it is a very great, important state, big state \u2015 if we are waiting for that state, you don't know what the answer is going to be until after maybe seven days. But it's not going to be seven days. It's going to be months or years.' [8/5/20[7]]'In an illegal late night coup, Nevada's clubhouse Governor made it impossible for Republicans to win the state. Post Office could never handle the Traffic of Mail-In Votes without preparation. Using Covid to steal the state. See you in Court!' [8/3/20[8]]'Glad I was able to get the very dishonest LameStream Media to finally start talking about the RISKS to our Democracy from dangerous Universal Mail-In-Voting (not Absentee Voting, which I totally support!).' [7/30/20[9]]'Must know Election results on the night of the Election, not days, months, or even years later!' [7/30/20[10]]'Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. Even testing areas are way off. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. Even beyond that, there's no accurate count!' [7/30/20[11]]'With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp;#38; FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???' [7/30/20[12]]'New York Mail-In voting is in a disastrous state of condition. Votes from many weeks ago are missing - a total mess. They have no idea what is going on. Rigged Election. I told you so. Same thing would happen, but on massive scale, with USA. Fake News refuses to report!' [7/29/20[13]]'The 2020 Election will be totally rigged if Mail-In Voting is allowed to take place, &amp;#38; everyone knows it. So much time is taken talking about foreign influence, but the same people won't even discuss Mail-In election corruption. Look at Patterson, N.J. 20% of vote was corrupted!' [7/26/20[14]]'Mail-In Ballot fraud found in many elections. People are just now seeing how bad, dishonest and slow it is. Election results could be delayed for months. No more big election night answers? 1% not even counted in 2016. Ridiculous! Just a formula for RIGGING an Election.... ....Absentee Ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your voting privilege. Not so with Mail-Ins. Rigged Election!!! 20% fraudulent ballots?' [7/10/20[15]]'Mail-In Ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud and a rigged 2020 Election. Look at all of the cases and examples that are out there right now, with the Patterson, N.J., being the most recent example. Republicans, in particular, cannot let this happen!' [7/2/20[16]]'If people can go out and protest, riot, break into stores, and create all sorts of havoc, they can also go out and VOTE \u2014 and keep our Election Honest. With millions of mail-in ballots being sent out, who knows where they are going, and to whom?' [6/22/20[17]]'Because of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, 2020 will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history - unless this stupidity is ended. We voted during World War One &amp;#38; World War Two with no problem, but now they are using Covid in order to cheat by using Mail-Ins!' [6/22/20[18]]'RIGGED 2020 ELECTION: MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS. IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!' [6/22/20[19]]'MAIL-IN VOTING WILL LEAD TO MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE. IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS TRAGEDY BEFALL OUR NATION. BIG MAIL-IN VICTORY IN TEXAS COURT TODAY. CONGRATS!!!' [5/28/20[20]]'So ridiculous to see Twitter trying to make the case that Mail-In Ballots are not subject to FRAUD. How stupid, there are examples, &amp;#38; cases, all over the place. Our election process will become badly tainted &amp;#38; a laughingstock all over the World. Tell that to your hater @yoyoel' [5/28/20[21]]'Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!' [5/27/20[22]]'Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that........happen  again. Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.' [5/27/20[23]]'There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp;#38; even illegally printed out &amp;#38; fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....' [5/26/20[24]]'. @Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post....' [5/26/20[25]]'The Democrats are trying to Rig the 2020 Election, plain and simple!' [5/24/20[26]]'The United States cannot have all Mail In Ballots. It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history. People grab them from mailboxes, print thousands of forgeries and 'force' people to sign. Also, forge names. Some absentee OK, when necessary. Trying to use Covid for this Scam!' [5/24/20[27]]'Absentee Ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens, military, and others who can't get to the polls on Election Day. These ballots are very different from 100% Mail-In Voting, which is 'RIPE for FRAUD,' and shouldn't be allowed!'

This should scarcely need restating, but has been sorely tested by Brexit, which, rightly or wrongly, the great bulk of big business, the City, and a fair old chunk of the SME sector, believe to be an act of economic self harm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet with the other hand he promises, in addressing the perceived political threat from Jeremy Corbyn's hard-Left Labour Party, to further shackle and tax the business communities and free markets he claims to champion. \"I am an enthusiast for the [technological] change which is coming, and for the benefits it will bring to our country\", he declared, only then to suggest that such change needs to be regulated if it is to serve society well, \"so that the capitalism of the 21st century looks nothing remotely like that of the 19th\".</p><p>Frustrated by the lack of progress in achieving international agreement on how best to tax the global internet giants, he also said that Britain would go it alone in introducing its own \"digital services tax\". This, by the way, is not the first time he has threatened such action, but he went further this week by saying that the time for international dialogue was over. Detailed proposals are promised in the Budget at the end of this month.</p><p>I don't want to labour the point on the self-evident contradictions in Hammond's speech, or indeed the difficulties the Tories face more generally, post the calamity of the financial crisis, in establishing a fully-fledged, free-market narrative that resonates with voters. It's hard to sell unbridled capitalism when it is seen so spectacularly and recently to have failed. I'll come back to the partial success Donald Trump has enjoyed in doing just that in the US, where a tax-cutting, deregulatory agenda helped secure the presidency.</p><p>But for now, I want to focus instead on the proposed digital services tax. This has been the holy grail of global tax policy for a long time. Yet, despite the best efforts of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation to knock heads together, there has been little progress in securing international agreement.</p><p>To the extent that there are global rules for taxation, the system was designed for a bygone, physical age when you could be fairly sure where companies had an established presence, where they were creating value and where the profits were being made. Definition was so much easier back then. The internet has turned things on their head, leading to a growing chorus of complaint from governments who fear the erosion in their tax base, and from Left-wing populists who depict the likes of Amazon as modern day robber barons.</p><p>Increasingly, they dominate our lives and usurp our established industries, but in many jurisdictions they pay little or no corporation tax. In a position paper last year, the UK Treasury said: \"It is essential that the international corporate tax rules ensure that UK corporation tax payments [by digital businesses] are commensurate with the value they generate from the UK market and specifically the participation of UK users.\"</p><p>Yet with 110 countries to satisfy, it is small wonder the OECD has struggled to find common ground. Some of the more obstructive nations may surprise you. We might assume, for instance, that as a manufacturing powerhouse, Germany would be desperate to tax the digital cuckoos in the nest as much as it could. Not so, for that assumption fails to recognise the degree to which the producer and service elements of modern manufacturing have, via the digital interface, grown together.</p><p>When a car sold in China goes in for its first service, it will be plugged into a computer. The data extracted will then be used to enhance and modify the design. China might reasonably think of this as value creation courtesy of the Chinese consumer, and want to tax the profit accordingly.</p><p>In the absence of wider international agreement, nations have unilaterally been taking their own \"interim measures\". Leading the way was the UK, with George Osborne's so-called \"Google tax\" - or diverted profits tax. This was a calculated response to Labour's constant attacks on the evil lords of the internet. From Israel to Italy, Hungary, India and Australia, countries have in frustration and under growing pressure from voters abandoned the multilateral approach, and in a half hearted sort of a way adopted their own solutions. None of them, on the other hand, have so far succeeded in raising much money. What's more, most of them involve simply patching up the old, largely broken, system and are therefore substantially ineffective.</p><p>Perhaps ironically, the biggest hope for a catch-all international solution comes from Donald Trump's America. I say ironically, because Trump is no fan of multilateral frameworks. But there are three things that work in its favour in this instance. One is that his predecessor as president, Barack Obama, was one of the big obstacles to progress. He was proud of America's new corporate titans, and took the view that if there were profits to be taxed, it should be in the US. Everyone else could go whistle. All attempts at internationalisation for tax purposes were blocked. To Mr Trump, anything Obama stood for must, by definition, be bad, and this is a case in point.</p><p>Despite his \"America first\" rallying cry, Mr Trump is also far less supportive of Silicon Valley vested interests than Obama, believing it to be a nest of hypocritical, self-regarding liberalism that wants to do him down.</p><p>And third, he sees an opportunity to rip up the old rule book and start afresh with a new international order that properly recognises national borders and rolls back the unaccountable globalism of big tech. Attempting to dictate radical international solutions may not be an option for the UK, which lacks America's economic and international clout. But nor is going it alone. It won't work in raising money, and would doubtless deter much digital inward investment and innovation. Any \"solution\" ultimately has to come from America; the Government should support the Trump administration's faintly nihilist, free-market efforts to secure one.</p><p>'Most of the unilateral attempts involve patching up the old, largely broken, system and are therefore ineffective'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Frustrated by the lack of progress in international agreement on how best to tax the global internet giants, the Chancellor said that Britain would go it alone with a 'digital services tax'I EDDIE MULHOLLAND FOR THE TELEGRAPH</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-142191790</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TD7-5GT1-DYTY-C3V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1082\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 3, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLPE</classCode><className>UK POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLR8</classCode><className>UK CONSERVATIVE PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

CNN reports that Trump is planning an executive order that could have significant implications for how internet companies moderate content. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. President Donald Trump is planning an executive order that could have huge ramifications for how tech companies moderate online content. </p><p>According to a report from CNN on Friday, the White House is drafting an order[2] that would give the Federal Communications Commission responsibility for overseeing how tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and others keep their services clear of unwanted content. It comes amid the American right-wing backlash a big tech, which has repeatedly been accused \u2014 without proof \u2014 of censoring conservative voices and being politically biased. At the heart of the issue is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. In short, this law means tech companies can't be blamed for content users post on their platforms. CNN reports that the White House is planning to narrow the immunity tech companies get \"if they remove or suppress content without notifying the user who posted the material, or if the decision is proven to be evidence of anticompetitive, unfair or deceptive practices.\" Meanwhile, if the executive order ultimately goes ahead, the Federal Trade Commission will reportedly be tasked with opening a \"public complaint docket\" to receive allegations of anti-conservative bias from the public, and will \"work with the FCC to develop a report investigating how tech companies curate their platforms and whether they do so in neutral ways.\" The full text of the draft executive order has not yet been made public, and could be changed before being formally introduced \u2014 or not introduced at all. But it highlights how Section 230 is becoming an increasingly hot button issue politically, with potentially huge ramifications for how tech companies moderate themselves. Republican senator Josh Hawley, a frequent tech critic, has introduced a bill[3] that would end Section 230 protections unless a company's immunity unless if it wasn't considered \"neutral\" politically \u2014 despite the fact that the original regulation was never intended as a way to ensure political neutrality.

The market is now closed. A sharp, hefty gavel on a day where the market was up after a day when it fell out of bed. Trading around the world pretty much over. No major markets open. It's now Friday. It's the 11th of August.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the last hour, Donald Trump has issued new threats to North Korea. And the stock market takes it in its stride over the medium term. Kenya's president declares victory in the countries elections. Will be in Nairobi live as his supporters celebrate. And Snap's shares prices are spinning faster than its famous hot dog. The problem is the share price is spinning all the way down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Richard Quest live in London. Where I still mean business.</p><p>Good evening. There are two major breaking stories to bring to your attention tonight. In the past few minutes, President Trump has issued a fresh warning to North Korea's leader. Kim Jong-un after his locked and loaded threat that Trump sent this morning.</p><p>And in Kenya, finally, we have a result of the country's presidential election. The President, the incumbent won. Although the opposition is refusing to accept the result. We'll be live in Nairobi and just a moment.</p><p>But we do need to start with the events in North Korea and President Trump's latest comments. The President has gone from threatening fire and fury, to this morning saying that the military plans were in place and the military plans here locked and loaded. Now in a tweet, he said that the commander-in-chief said the military solutions are fully in place in the event North Korea decides to act unwisely.</p><p>Chinese state media issued its own warning to North Korea saying China would stay neutral if North Korea launched missiles. Countries in the region are protecting themselves militarily. Now in the last hour, I just need you to read this to be absolutely clear as to what the President actually said. In the last hour, let me find the President's comments. The President has basically said that it's warning North Korea, President Trump said Kim Jong-un will regret it fast if he issues an overt threat or attacks Guam or any U.S. ally.</p><p>We have three sentences from the President, well four if you take it. Firstly, fire and fury. Secondly, maybe it wasn't tough enough. Thirdly, this morning, locked and loaded. And now, in a statement in speaking in Bedminster he says, President Trump says Kim Jong-un will regret it fast if he issues an overt threat.</p><p>Both Russia and Japan have boosted their air defenses. We'll hear from Japan's ambassador to the United Kingdom in just a moment. Russia has earns the U.S. to remain calm. The president defended his rhetoric and warned it would regret threats of any attack on Guam.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We hope that they are going to fully understand the gravity of what I said. And what I said is what I mean. So hopefully they'll understand, Peter, exactly what I said and the meaning of those words. Those words are very, very easy to understand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: As the threats fly between the U.S. and North Korea, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, sad sanctions, not military are the answer. Moments ago, President Trump said the Chancellor was speaking to the United States, rather she was probably speaking for Germany. However, Mrs. Merkel warned harsh words will not calm the tensions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR: I believe that. I am fully convinced that an escalation of rhetoric will not contribute to a solution of this conflict. I do not see a military solution to this conflict. Rather, I see enduring work like we saw in the U.N. Security Council with members, with resolutions in view of the North Korea. And above all, tight cooperation with the countries involved. Especially the U.S. and China, but also South Korea, of course Japan. Germany will be intensely involved with the potential nonmilitary solutions that we see. But escalation of rhetoric is the wrong answer.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:05:00] QUEST: With me now is the Japanese ambassador in London. Good to see you ambassador. The position taken now by the Japanese government as related to North Korea, obviously is extremely serious. And this development of a missile defense system that people are now talking about, what's the goal here?</p><p>KOJI TSURUOKA, JAPANESE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K.: This is just being responsible for the defense of Japan and the protection of the Japanese people. We take all means that are necessary to defend ourselves. If there is no need to do that, we don't have to do it.</p><p>QUEST: Does your government see any situation whereby the U.S. President's response arguably is making a bad situation worse?</p><p>TSURUOKA: The situation has been made seriously worse by the North Korean leader when he launched a series of missiles and proceeding that also engaged in a nuclear experiment. These are all in serious violation of international commitments that they've made in the past. And also, a serious violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions. So, who has violated international agreed obligations? Is the first question that needs to be addressed and there's no question that it is North Korea that has consistently violated that.</p><p>QUEST: This is the first time, ambassador, we've seen a U.S. president or any of the Allied protagonists, actually ratcheted up. Actually, said lock and loaded, fire and fury, might not might not have been tough enough. This is a new -- when I say the word game I'm not being flippant. But this is a new game.</p><p>TSURUOKA: Once President Trump came in office, you may know very well, that the Japanese Prime Minister had a very powerful discussion with him. And one of the most important subjects they discussed is North Korea. How we could deal with this threat. The threat is now serious and great and we can't overlook this threat that is coming. And President Trump said to the Japanese Prime Minister as well as to the public, that all options are on the table.</p><p>The elaboration of that is in his words, what he would say. But it is publicly clear that all options are on the table. That has not been said in the past because we have been trying to resolve these issues peacefully through talks, but then, talks produced nothing. And this is the experience of the past 20 years.</p><p>QUEST: Let us talk if we may briefly about the issue of Brexit. There is a fascinating story that Japan has offered to help the negotiators, the Brexit negotiators. Because you've just concluded a trade agreement after many years of negotiating with the EU. What are you offering? Are you offering to help?</p><p>TSURUOKA: We have been negotiating with the EU for more than four years. And just last month we have agreed in principle of overcoming most of the political difficult issues in the negotiation. But that doesn't mean we have completed negotiations. There's much more to be done.</p><p>QUEST: You think you can help the Brits.</p><p>TSURUOKA: We would be happy to help both the Brits and the EU to conclude and finalize a smooth exit that will benefit all of us. Including the two of them. Including the world economy. This is the definite intention to help both. We are not standing on either side of it.</p><p>QUEST: Ambassador, good to see you, sir.</p><p>TSURUOKA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: The Japanese ambassador.</p><p>Moments ago, President Trump said the U.S. would be very successful, very quickly against Korea. He blame past administrations for failing to take on the issue. CNN's Barbara Starr is at the Pentagon. And Barbara, I fear I have an entire raft of questions for which you will not have -- we will not have full answers. But listen, let me just repeat the words that you heard the president, if he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat or if he does anything with respect to Guam or any place that an American territory American ally, he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast.</p><p>The President is now backing himself into a corner if Kim does something.</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well you know, let's pull those words apart for a minute, Richard. What the President is -- if you take him at his word -- what he is saying is if Kim does something to an American ally, Japan, South Korea, we have mutual defense treaties. I'm not sure if that's the right legal word, but basically, we have promised to help defend both of those countries from North Korea. That's point number one.</p><p>[16:10:00] If he does something to an American territory, Guam, Guam is America. If North Korea attacks America, any U.S. president would respond. Respond fast, he says. The military options are designed for a very quick response. So, I think that were looking at is a couple of different things here.</p><p>If there is an overt attack by the North Koreans. The U.S. certainly has every right and would be expected by everyone to respond to that. Perhaps the deeper question is whether he is poking at Kim and trying to provoke something. Which would be a political statement, not a military statement. And what do you do if Kim engages in some sort of provocation like firing missiles into the sea that is not a direct threat? That is lots of middle ground the here.</p><p>QUEST: And that's the tricky area, isn't it? Because if Kim just raises the temperature ever so slightly, then we get into very fine debating points with horrific consequences on is this an overt threat.</p><p>STARR: Well, you do. I mean, let's say, we've all seen Kim's rhetoric, right? He's making all of these threats, verbal threats, to turn the U.S. into a sea of fire, if you will. He's been doing this for years. He's put out propaganda videos showing parts of the America burning down because of North Korea weapons. That sort of thing. You don't launch a military strike just because somebody says something mean. I'm not sure that would qualify as a lawful military order for the United States. You have to have a threat and that is why the U.S. intelligence and the U.S. military are watching North Korea around-the-clock.</p><p>What they're looking for is any sign of an intermittent missile launch. Interesting question, I am no lawyer. So, let's say you see a sign of an intermittent missile launch. Do you engage in a preemptive strike to take it out? The President says he hasn't taken that idea off the table. Or do you think wait until it launches, until the threat launches and hopefully be able to shoot at North Korea missile down within minutes of launch? These are very difficult questions.</p><p>QUEST: Barbara Starr, thank you at the Pentagon.</p><p>Now tonight, our other major story that were following very closely. In Kenya, there's breaking news tonight. The election results have been announced.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I therefore wish to declare honorable Uhuru Kenyatta.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So, President Uhuru Kenyatta wins a second five-year term. He was reelected with 54.2 percent of the vote. The challenger, Raila Odinga, holds 44.7 percent. In the past few moments, Mr. Kenyatta, President Kenyatta has called for calm and urged Kenyans to unite.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UHURU KENYATTA, KENYON PRESIDENT: We are not enemies. We are all descendants of one Republic. As with any competition, there shall always be winners and there shall be losers. But we all belong to one great nation called Kenya. And I extend the hand of friendship. I extend the hand of cooperation. I extend the hand of partnership. I'm fully aware that this country needs all of us pulling together in order for us to succeed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The opposition has refused to accept the official results. And Farai Sevenzo is in Nairobi Kenya doing sterling work for us. Farai, as you have indeed all week. All right, you've got to the end of the week and we got the results. But how realistic is this opposition claim that they won't accept it? Are they just making a bit of huff and puff and a bit of noise? But eventually will full their tents and had off?</p><p>FARAI SEVENZO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Richard, I have to tell you that they left the tallying center at Bomas, Kenya just outside of Nairobi and made some very emotional and very, very assertive claims. They actually say that it was a charade. That it is a disaster. That they will take no part in this announcement of the results. And more importantly, they even saying that, they rounded on the observers, on John Kerry, on Marietje Schaake, on the former president of Ghana and said that these people should have been vetted.</p><p>[16:15:00] Because they have given the authority to this election commission to say what they are saying. And more importantly they say that they don't want to go to court. They've been there before. And which begs the question, what will they do.</p><p>QUEST: OK. So, what will they do? We will have to wait and see. But what I'm finding fascinating is this 10-point discrepancy. This 10-point margin of victory by the president, when we were told -- and obviously you're just reporting what the opinion polls say -- this was a tight race. This wasn't a tight race, this was a landslide.</p><p>SEVENZO: It seems like a landslide now, Richard. We spoke yesterday and you said you can believe the polls these days? But this is where we are. It's a huge margin. I think it's up to the 9 percent did points at the moment. And while I'm telling you this, we are hearing from our sources in Kibera, in Mathare, in Kisuma, all Mr. Odinga's strongholds, that there are people out there on the streets. In fact, we are also hearing news of police bullets to disperse them, from the police. We will yet confirm this for you by tomorrow. But this is a situation at the moment in these strongholds.</p><p>QUEST: Right, Farai, you've just left us with a very sobering thought. That what had been a model or we'd hoped was a model election in Africa in a strong democracy, tonight. Are you, hearing reports, does it seem as if this could all go wrong?</p><p>SEVENZO: I am not to sound alarmist. But we can only report what we're hearing. Kisibu is tense. Mathare, the high-density suburb in Nairobi is also tense. We are hearing -- our sources -- people who trust me well -- are telling us there are people on the streets and lots of shouting and phrases like Uhuru must go. So, it's really incumbent on the new president to try to unite this country. In of course, we hope that Mr. Odinga will kind of give some indication of where he wants this opposition Nasa alliance to go.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, Farai. Thank you very much and thank you, sir, for all the marvelous work you've done through the course of the week. Bringing us the importance of what's happening in Kenya.</p><p>To the markets. Down .5 percent to 1 percent, 1.5 percent on the Nasdaq yesterday. And today the U.S. market shrugged off the fresh threats between President Trump and North Korea. Look closely right end of the graph. You'll see the dip that where President Trump made his comment roughly at that time.</p><p>[16:20:08] QUEST: Welcome back to QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Tonight, coming from London. This is the way the trading day from New York goes. Although the market is positive for the entire session, just look at the choppiness. Small moments, I'll grant you, small moments but the markets taking a breath at the end of a tense and dramatic week. This area here is roughly where President Trump makes his latest comments about Kim Jong-un, when he says he will regret it. The market now having dipped following the comment, holds its own actually comes up and sells off. I suspect selling off because people don't want to go into the weekend in a long position or at least they want to square it off.</p><p>As the Asian and European markets sold off, American investors reverse some losses. And take a look at the week overall. And you see there's the Dow, which holds its own. The KOSPI stays lower. The FTSE continues to fall. And I think the reason the FTSE continues to fall is because it had seen the worst of the day from New York. The biggest losers on Friday. It was the worst week of the year for European stocks. The FTSE is off 2.7 percent. Overall, we can roughly say it's a large number. But $1 trillion was wiped from global markets. The traders and economists we've be speaking to this week are looking beyond the threat from North Korea, though.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TED WEISBERG, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES: They excuse is Korea, whether it's real or not remains to be seen. Hopefully it isn't. But that was the excuse.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obviously, we're focusing on price, not what's happening in politics. If you net-net, look at the action from this week. We made all-time forever highs on Tuesday. Let's remember that and now we're down about 1 percent now across the board for the week. So, it hasn't been a catastrophic drop in the markets. It's more a psychological shift.</p><p>RICHARD CLARIDA, GLOBAL STRATEGIC ADVISOR, PIMCO: It's too soon to tell whether it's just a blip or a trend. But obviously, you know, there is a lot of uncertainty around the world right now. And I think markets are appreciating that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Joining me is Bob Iaccino, the founder and chief strategist at Path Trading Partners at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. So, I'm fascinated -- earlier in the week the President makes a comment and the market falls out of bed. He makes another comment about Kim regretting it. The market falls. But it pulls itself back up again. So, what's the underlying trend -- not trend. What's the underlying sentiment I suppose is the best word?</p><p>BOB IACCINO, FOUNDER AND CHIEF STRATEGIST, PATH TRADING PARTNERS: Well, thanks for having me. There is a couple of things going on here in toward Friday. If you look back over the last say 15 to 20 Fridays, the moves have not been big at all. There would be absolutely no reason for anybody who wanted to come in and by dips. And big or small this is a dip and there's been consistent dip buying in this market since 2010.</p><p>If you were to buy in a dip a Friday going into a weekend, where the rhetoric continues to grow. And I don't know how it gets much hotter in terms of rhetoric. Then we're going to fire for missiles and we are locked and loaded. I don't know how it gets much hotter than that. But there's certainly is no reason to add to a long position or initiate a long position, on a Friday afternoon.</p><p>The last little dip you saw in toward the end of the day put us basically at unchanged. I think were up a few cents. Not enough to matter. They put is basically in unchanged, was exactly that. You saw people, a small batch of people, coming in and covering shorts that they put on after that comment. And there are no new longs being initiated in this market going into a weekend.</p><p>QUEST: And yet -- and this is where, this is where it all gets really tricky. Everyone I speak to says we are looking for that moment where it is considered to be a buy on the dips. And I'm not suggesting for a moment to any viewer that it's arrived or it's not arrived. But the market wants to go higher or seems to appear. And these are breathers.</p><p>IACCINO: We had really, a really good earnings season. With well over 70 percent beating on both ESP and revenue, 10.1 percent blended earnings growth as of last Friday. We'll see what the report card looks like later today for the rest of the week. That's a great earning season. Having said that, one of the keys that I noticed is in the S&amp;P got below the 50- day moving average yesterday and did not close back above it today.</p><p>That's not a good sign. It's happened a few times. It happened about four or five times since the middle of the last year and every time it closes below and does not get back above it the next day, it begets another couple of down days. Here's the key to the North Korea tensions, we have a target date. North Korea is talking about doing something in the last week or so of August. So, I think you've seen a struggle as the rhetoric gets hotter. Again, I don't know it gets hotter. You may sort of hobble along trying to get back above that 50-day moving average.</p><p>[16:25:00] QUEST: And as you say is this market, is this not the time when you want to be going into a weekend long. Thank you, Bob, we appreciate it.</p><p>IACCINO Thanks for having me.</p><p>QUEST: Snapchat is dancing hot dog was the star of Thursday's second- quarter earnings call. The chief executive, Evan Spiegel, called it the first augmented reality superstar. And boasted the twirling hotdog has been viewed more than 1.5 billion times. Can a twirling or swirling hotdog save snap and its investors anytime soon? The shares of snap, it's a fresh record low on Friday. The companies reported losses of around $450 million. And that's enough to buy, by the way, 100 million real hotdogs. Snap saw its user growth rise by 7 million. That pales in comparison to Facebook's Instagram, which added 50 million users from last quarter.</p><p>Paula La Monica is with us. The twirling or swirling hotdogs is a relatively new phenomenon, even to me. But it's not going to save Snap.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT: No. This was obviously not a quarter or a day for Snapchat investors to relish., Richard. And I apologize for that. But Snapchat is facing the Facebook, Instagram problem. As you point out, it's not hard for Facebook to come out with me- too products and then just steal away users from Snapchat. And that is something that Snapchat has to figure out. They need to come up with something that is not going to be just Soares's to replicated by Mark Zuckerberg and his minions at Facebook and Instagram. It's a problem.</p><p>QUEST: So, Paul, a moment ago I was looking down, and I'm looking just to see -- so, my snap investment, because as we know, we're all enjoying the schadenfreude of my misery with Snap.</p><p>LA MONICA: My condolences.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, but more than that. It's down now 58 percent from where I bought it. Because I bought the day after the IPO at the all-time high of around $28 a share. What more can I say on that. Talk to viewers, who are not as familiar. What happens in these scenarios where share prices just keep dwindling down to not quite nothing. But almost into oblivion.</p><p>LA MONICA: I think that the problem that people are having with Snapchat right now is that this should be a very good time for the company right now. You have a market that today and this week, not withstand, was done extremely well. The Nasdaq is red-hot. Companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon and Google, they are all doing extraordinarily well right now. Tech stocks are hot but Snapchat is not taking part. Because this market is different than I would say 2000, the last big tech bubble. They are more discerning and they are looking at earnings. And the lack of those earnings at Snapchat are a problem and they will be for the foreseeable future. Facebook, remember, was profitable when it went public. The issue wasn't is Facebook a viable business. It's just can Facebook come up with a mobile strategy. Guess what, it did.</p><p>QUEST: Paul La Monica, have a lovely weekend with the family.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you, Sir.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>As we continue tonight, the egg scandal in Europe which threatens to get much worse, as millions of eggs are tainted and have to be destroyed.</p><p>[16:30:59] QUEST: I'm Richard Quest. There's more Quest Means Business in just a moment. When Google is forced to stop an all-hands meeting after employee questions are leaked to the press.</p><p>And something is rotten in Europe's egg industry. More than a dozen countries having to deal with tainted eggs. But before that this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first.</p><p>President Trump has issued a fresh warning to North Korea's Kim Jong on after his locked and loaded tweet this morning. Now the president says the North Korea leader will regret it fast in his words. If he issues an overt threat to the US or its allies.</p><p>Egyptian authorities are trying to figure out what caused two trains to collide. Killing at least 37 people more than 100 were injured. In the crash in Alexandria.</p><p>The country's prosecutor's dispatch teams to begin an investigation</p><p>Well, Uhuru Kenyatta is urging pace after he was declared the winner of the presidential election Kenya. This will be a second term in office. He defeated Odinga, who refuses to accept the results claiming the vote was hacked.</p><p>The European Union is calling an extraordinary meeting to tackle a growing scandal after tainted eggs. The eggs have been found in 15 countries including Switzerland and Hong Kong. They are tainted with the pesticide. Now, official say it is not a public health emergency, two arrests have been made, and millions of eggs or egg products have now destroyed and full off the shelves.</p><p>CNN Money's Europe editor, hang on, they are tainted with the pesticide but it is not a public health emergency?</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN MONEY EUROPE EDITOR: they are tainted with the pesticide called Fipronil which it seems Dutch farms, poultry farms have been spraying some on their laying chickens since back in last year. Perhaps even November, it seems though this was discovered, now Fipronil should not get into the food chain. It is technically band for this kind of use, that is why we have seen two arrests so far. But in theory it is only toxic if it builds up in very large quantities in certain internal organs. So, a lot of people are saying here, especially health officials. That yes, people should be cautious about these products, but they will not build up in significant amounts to do any lasting harm.</p><p>Having said that though what we have seen as you quite rightly pointed out, Richard, a lot of eggs, thousands, millions across the European continent have been destroyed, and also products, remember that products also contain powdered egg products. As seems that a lot of people may have already have consumed some of the powdered egg products and baked goods and so on and so forth.</p><p>QUEST: How did all this come about? I mean how do we find out about?</p><p>DOS SANTOS: This is the big furor here across the European Union because you and I know having covered Brussels that there is one thing at the heart of euro-crats psyche it is protecting agriculture and food safety standards. So, the big question is how exactly does this happen? And already we are seeing a bit of war of words between a number of EU countries about this. Seems as though there may have been a chicken manufacturer in the Netherlands in particular that bought this pesticide. Now, a director from the pesticide company in Belgium has been arrested, I director from a chicken firm in the Netherlands has been arrested as a result of this. And they were spraying these chickens because they had an outbreak of lice. So, parasites here. But the reality is they should've perhaps told officials how much of this particular spray that they were using. They should not have been using it.</p><p>And then if it's gone through the chickens into the eggs, as I was saying, it might take some time for significant amounts of quantities to build up from there, but again there are questions whether or not about poultry meat should be tested as well across the EU. The EU is having an emergency meeting only, Richard, on 26 September. It seems as though Dutch authorities already knew that there was a problem with this chemical getting into food chain back in November. So, there is a lot of questions here that need to be answered. But they probably won't until those European officials have come back from holiday in September.</p><p>[16:35:00] QUEST: Officials say it is not a public health emergency, I am guessing it is one of the stories where we have to eat a ton of eggs to get enough of the pesticide. I mean you don't want any of the pesticide in you but I mean I don't know.</p><p>DOS SANTOS: That's exactly right, but the big question again is how much of this kind of egg product has been powdered and ended up into baked goods. In fact, it is countries like the U.K. actually, that are screaming the loudest about this. I believe we can see some of the U.K. headlines today as you mentioned the tabloids have had a field day here with a kind of gallows humor, because remember the you and I know here in this country we had a big scandal surrounding salmonella in eggs that cost a big government minister her position about 20 odd years ago.</p><p>QUEST: I was going to say you don't remember that.</p><p>DOS SANTOS: I do. But I should say that Edwina Curry.</p><p>QUEST: Curried eggs.</p><p>DOS SANTOS: That is right curried eggs and it cost her position. If we just look at the headlines again from some of these newspapers, even though the United Kingdom is a country that imports far fewer eggs than any other EU country, 85 percent of our eggs come from the United Kingdom. And we do not have this pesticide in the food chain, as you can see the daily mail saying things like scrambled to clear these poison eggs off of people's shelves. And many supermarket chains have been taking products off of their shelves as a result, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you, have a good weekend. Thank you.</p><p>As we continue tonight, European shares posted their worst week of the year amid uncertainty over the North Korea crisis, the FTSE lost one percent on Friday, the DAX closed flat, CAC also lost about 1 percent and that is the reason because they are seeing what is happening in New York.</p><p>Ten years ago, this week, there was a very simple press release. A French bank admitted not knowing the true value of one of its U.S. investment vehicles. This was the starting pistol for a decade of financial misery. BNP Paribas temporarily suspends the calculation of the net asset value of the following funds -- Parvest Dynamic, BNP Paribas ABS EURIBOR, and BNP Paribas ABS EONIA.</p><p>Upon that simple and deadly and dastardly press release, well, followed bankruptcies, bank collapses and central banks that took us into absolutely uncharted territory with quantitative easing. It all happened 10 years ago this week. It all started.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let's look at the situation now, the Dow woke up this morning with a downward tumble after opening down 121 points at this moment.</p><p>Two words that you're going to hear a lot of today, subprime mortgages. There is a fear that problems with those housing loans are sparking a credit crunch and that could impact economic growth and corporate profits. BNP says it is freezing 3 refunds that invested in U.S. subprime mortgages. Because it was not able to properly value their assets.</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The American economy is the envy of the world, and we need to keep it that way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Since word got out that Northern Rock Bank had applied for emergency funding from Bank of England, panicky customers like these have lined up and taken out a reported $4 billion from Britain's fifth- largest mortgage lender.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nothing but fiction this idea this problem can be contained within subprime, whatever that means. It is just not going to be the case for the balance of the year or even beyond.</p><p>QUEST: All right, what does the investor do? Sit on their hands, selling the cash, or selling may go away, it's a bit late for that now, but you know what I mean.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Very difficult question, Richard, obviously we are seeing extreme volatility minute to minute, hour to hour. I think the one dominant theme that we are seeing in markets is a repricing of risk. So, stay away from those risky investments.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Two big British banks both hit hard in the credit crunch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Lehman Brothers a company that was too big to fail but did.</p><p>QUEST: Good evening, we know of course what happened, we know the financial world has changed now, a year to the day that Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:40:00] JIM BOULDEN, JOURNALIST: It was really what triggered it.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, but here is the chain reaction. Northern Rock happened because BNP Paribas happened, because all of these, there was a sudden lack of confidence and trust.</p><p>BOULDEN: And credit freeze.</p><p>QUEST: Credit freeze, nobody was prepared to lend to anybody else. And North Rock relied on that.</p><p>BOULDEN: And they relied on it too much, because they were trying to spend, everybody thought this is a game that we can't lose, we have got to get in. Icelandic banks, Irish banks, U.K. banks all of those collapses were yet to come.</p><p>QUEST: Once Lehman Brothers went, then of course it mushrooms, the credit crunch continues and now we are going from a banking crisis to an economic crisis.</p><p>BOULDEN: And remember, we haven't had the debt crisis yet in the euro zone.</p><p>QUEST: But that followed on.</p><p>BOULDEN: So, we have the great recession, and we had Icelandic banks collapse, we had the Irish government collapse and their banks collapse, and then we had the whole thing about European debt. The Greek crisis which we still are talking about to this day hadn't even surfaced, we weren't even talking about that yet, 10 years ago.</p><p>QUEST: I mean we could argue some people say we should have foreseen it, the question of course how much damage did this crisis to do?</p><p>BOULDEN: It is extraordinary I think when we think back of all the issues, we talked about how unemployment in places like Spain.</p><p>QUEST: Twenty five percent.</p><p>BOULDEN: And we saw it in Greece. We can say that Greece was not a recession but a depression, and they are still in that to this day. And you talk about the U.S., so many people losing their homes, I know that does not sound right today, we are talking about that happening. An entire class of people absolutely got wiped out.</p><p>QUEST: Jim, you and I sat in this room covering this. Some days the Dow fell 1000 points. Some days it went up 500. Did you ever fear that it was going to get away from regulators or the central banks, and they would lose control?</p><p>BOULDEN: I sat in this very room and Sunday nights having to do live shots because we are waiting for a message from the ECB or someone to say something before the Asian markets opened. Every Friday for several months, every Saturday, every Sunday the bankers were getting together and trying to make sure when markets reopened on Monday that they had said something to try to get it from going out of control. And a lot of people I talked to absolutely thought the euro was going to collapse after all of this. And of course, it didn't.</p><p>QUEST: Great to have you, sir. Really good to have you, have a good weekend. Thank you</p><p>As we continue tonight the controversial memo leaks to the press as a companywide meeting is canceled at the last minute.</p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Google has announced the new computer science grant for young people from diverse backgrounds. So, diversity within the company remains a headache. The chief executive Sundar Pichai canceled and all hands town hall meeting on diversity at the last minute on Thursday. He was supposed to address the widely circulated memo which said Google was a hostile workplace for conservatives. The meeting was canceled after employees' questions were leaked.</p><p>Now, the original goal according to the chief executive had been to answer the question, how do we create a more inclusive environment for all? That was the goal of the town hall meeting. The clearly, anything that was going to happen was going to be highly controversial. And conservative Googlers are wondering what is leadership doing when Googlers like me feel invited and accepted. In other words, whether or not they subscribe to the outrageous views of the man who wrote the manifesto, there are still a lot of people at Google who probably are conservative or maybe right wing and therefore feel that they have a right, as indeed they do to be included and invited.</p><p>And then of course this got leaked, and then everything else gets leaked. The question of the leaks concerned Googlers wants to know, can we get an update on progress towards identifying leakers? Put all of this together, and you have what can only be described as a Google mess.</p><p>Laurie Segall is with me in New York. How does Google extricate itself from this with something approaching humility and indeed dignity?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN CHIEF TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: It is interesting because a source inside said this is the biggest PR disaster Google has had in a while. I think it is difficult because you are saying this tension of free speech, and you saw when these folks came forward in the town hall, you have Sundar Pichai literally coming back from vacation to have this public town hall. And he could not have the town hall without the question is immediately leaking to the press to us here at CNN and in general.</p><p>Then you have this other problem which is a lot of the stuff that is getting leaked, a lot of Google employees are being harassed. You have this environment full of political tension, and you know it is a very big issue. I think what Sundar said was he was going to have small meetings with individuals. He wanted to hear people out, he wanted people to email him. But he wasn't going to do it in a big public forum. Now, the ethos of Google which is almost what got him into this mess too, is all about free speech. About putting your ideas out there on these internal forums about challenging each other. So, I think the company has really taken a hit because that this is one of those issues that is just very, very complicated. Because it wasn't just about gender. And it is about politics as well.</p><p>QUEST: All right, but here is the real tricky question, in a sense, Laurie, how many people are not going to open a Google search box because of this? And therefore, you know, I mean, at the end of the day look, I have got Internet Explorer, I have got all of the different search options here. But how many people are not going to use Google as a result?</p><p>SEGALL: I think that is a good question, I don't think many people are going to take this and say I am not going to use Google. Even look at the controversy over Uber which is almost to a lesser degree a lot of folks are upset with Uber over a lot of the sexual harassment claims, and a lot of things going on internally. And if you ask anyone who still has the app, are you still using it? And their answer is generally yes. I don't think this will impact immediately the business, but one really interesting point I will make is I spoke to the CEO of a billion-dollar company, he did not want to be named.</p><p>And I asked him about this, and what he said to me was, Laurie, companies in Silicon Valley now are like democratic institutions, and they have to create and protect their own culture. Because that is how they protect their talent, their engineers that make the culture. And he said look what happened with Uber, they could not afford to keep this guy. They could not afford to keep him on board because he had offended so many people. And what he said to me, I love this line, he said, talent can vote with their feet. They can walk out the door if they don't like the ethos.</p><p>[16:50:00] QUEST: No, Laurie, Laurie, your billionaire has merely discovered what every other major company has no for generations that it is all about talent and the retention of talent.</p><p>SEGALL: Sure, but we are at a point, of course, it's about that, but we are at a point where this could have gone either way. Sundar Pichai was in a very specific position where he didn't have to fire this engineer, he did not have to do it. But he did make a statement by doing it, and it was a very politically sensitive one because while these ideas were offensive towards women in many ways, he also made some comments about Google saying that it was an ideological echo chamber.</p><p>And they knew by firing him, by pushing him out the door they will have proven his point to a degree. And he will have his following. He has become kind of a fixture in the alt right movement as well. I think that now they have opened themselves up to a lot of new problems, and conservatives within the company are afraid to speak out. And I do think that does say something about this open environment.</p><p>QUEST: Good to talk to you, have a lovely weekend. Come back to us next week.</p><p>Out with the old and in with the new, Lego is celebrating its 85th birthday. And a young CEO seems to be the company's gift to itself.</p><p>QUEST: Lego is celebrating its 85th birthday this week and on that big birthday, the company's chief executive announced he would be leaving after only eight months on the job. Lego announced that Bali Padda is being replaced by a younger man. A Dane Niels Christiansen, in New York I asked David Robertson who wrote a book on Lego's innovation, why had the board basically decided to ditch the CEO now?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID ROBERTSON, AUTHOR: The one thing we do know is that Lego had this production shortfall last year. They have eight years of 21 percent average annual growth from 2007 to 2015, that falls to 6 percent last year. And what I hear from inside the company it is not a demand saying, it is a supply thing. They could not make enough bricks. And given the business model of Lego which is that they pay a dollar a pound U.S. for ABS plastic, they sell to us for $50 a pound. Whenever you have unfulfilled orders, that is all profit that is lost.</p><p>And so, there is also a new factory in China that is coming online. And that came online at the end of November, and you know, we will find out soon enough, are they continuing to be supply constrained. And Bali Padda of course was responsible for operations last year. And so maybe there is something there, but the other explanation could be that, Niels Christiansen has been on the market for eight months. And it could be that maybe he got some other offer. Right, maybe he came to Lego and said, look, I would love to work for you guys but I have got this other offer on the table, make up your mind. So, they had to rush this faster than they wanted.</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST: Finally, if we look at Lego, such a phenomenally successful company, do you see this as a blip, both the production problems and the chief executive being fired and replaced within eight months, just a blip in an otherwise stellar performance?</p><p>ROBERTSON: Yes, so far, it's only a blip in otherwise a stellar performance. There are a lot of companies that would be thrilled to have 25 percent gross profit margins on 6 percent growth. But again, Lego before that was 21 percent growth with 34 percent gross profit margin. So, it is a major step down, now, if that just happens for one year while he a new factory gets up to speed. But we all know that a lot of ships have crashed on those rocks of trying to get Chinese factories up and going to the level of quality for the rest of their factories around the world. And so, if there is a blip in China then this may be something that is more than just a temporary hitch in an otherwise stellar performance.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Problems of Lego. We will have a Profitable Moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment, 10 years ago the crisis started and became known as the great financial crisis. We know the reasons why we don't need to back through them all over again. But just to get a bit of a feeling of what it was like sitting here covering it at that time, what we were told by regulators and bankers again and again is we dread the moment that a consumer puts their cash card into an ATM in the machine says not today.</p><p>That was the financial Armageddon that everyone was fearing. That is what could have brought the entire global financial system crashing down. But it did not happen because central banks moved in fast. It didn't happen because there was repair work done quickly enough. But let me tell you, it was closest any of us have covered this or have been involved with this has ever seen that we ever want to get close to a financial disaster.</p><p>And that is quest MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London, whatever you are up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. Have a lovely weekend, I'm back in New York on Monday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017081101cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P78-T421-JB20-G4TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7330\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 11, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As far as antitrust is concerned, we'll have to take a look at that but I want them to do well.\" He also seemingly took issue with the European Union's regulation of big tech companies, saying that the EU \"takes a lot of money out of our companies\" and that it should be the United States., not the EU, placing regulations on tech.</p><p>On antitrust law specifically, the White House has no direct authority over the enforcement of such issues, which are principally handled by the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice.</p><p>\"The White House could certainly suggest to both agencies that they look at it, but the White House itself won't do anything,\" said Gigi Sohn, a fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology &amp; Policy. \"The gap between 'looking at' and 'doing something' can be very, very wide.\"</p><p>While Big Tech has a chorus of critics nowadays -- Congress has held a number of hearings this year around data protection, election interference and related issues -- major overhauls of antitrust law or enforcement may not be an immediate threat. But with a potential shift in power coming after  , a new Congress could take a stab at strengthening existing antitrust laws.</p><p>\"Congress can definitely make it easier or harder for a company to win antitrust cases; they can change the burden of proof,\" Sohn said. In strengthening the government's hand in antitrust cases, Congress would be likely to have greater success should Democrats take control of the House and the Senate remain closely split between the two parties on Tuesday, she added.</p><p>\"Shoring up antitrust and giving increased scrutiny to these companies is definitely on the Democrats' agenda,\" Sohn said.</p><p>Sally Hubbard, an antitrust expert and former Asst. Attorney General in New York State's Antitrust Bureau, added that state attorneys general could be motivated to kick. On Sept. 25, the Department of Justice convened a meeting with legal officials from 19 states broadly focused on tech companies' power.</p><p>\"I wouldn't be surprised if there was at least an investigation started, either by state attorneys general banding together or the federal government, but these things do take time,\" Hubbard said. \"[The Sept. 25 meeting] was even more of an indicator that we could see movement coming from the state AGs.\"</p><p>Wherever anti-trust enforcement of tech comes from, there may have been another agenda entirely in Trump's comments to Axios: Simply keeping tech companies on their toes, according to Sohn.</p><p>\"I think what's going on here is Trump wants to keep these companies guessing,\" she added.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

The tech giant removed their accounts, fan pages and affiliated groups on Facebook as well as its photo-sharing service Instagram, charging that their presence on the social networking sites had become \"dangerous.\"</p><p>In doing so, Facebook pointed to its efforts to remove users who \"promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology.\" Before its permanent ban, Facebook had taken more limited action targeting users such as Jones, who has threatened journalists and attacked the victims of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Jones and others sharply criticized Facebook for its decision.</p><p>Trump Jr.'s tweet marked his latest criticism of tech companies on grounds that they silence conservatives, a charge that Facebook, Google and Twitter long have denied. The fears pervade the upper echelons of the Republican Party, even prompting GOP lawmakers to hold a series of hearings over the past two years to probe if Silicon Valley censors right-leaning users and news.</p><p>President Donald Trump similarly has accused popular social-networking sites of exhibiting political bias, and he's repeatedly threatened to regulate Silicon Valley in response.

Plus, I cannot vote for those who tormented me. Former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe breaks his silence ahead of the country's first election since his ouster. And why are people jumping out of moving cars to the sound of Drake's latest hit? If you're not caught up on the latest social media craze, I've got you covered later this hour. Live from the CNN center here in Atlanta, I'm Cyril Vanier, it's great to have you with us.</p><p>The firefighters are hoping that they have now reached the turning point in their fight to contain a massive wildfire in Northern California. In just a week, the so-called car fire has burned more than 36,000 hectares and for the moment it's only five percent contained. At least six people have died so far including two children and their great-grandmother. The widowed great-grandfather told CNN that he spoke to his family as the fire was closing in on them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLEDSOE: I talked to -- I talked to Jr. on the phone until he died. He just kept saying grandpa, he said, it's a coming at me. He said it's coming in. The fire is coming in at the back door. Come on grandpa. I said, I'm down the road. He said come and get us. Emily said, I love you, grandpa. Grandma says, I love you grandpa and Jr. says I love you come and get us. Coming and get us. I said I'm on my way. I said -- he talking until he died. I tried to call him back and it just went to nothing. Poor babies, and my wife. I go (INAUDIBLE) I said, what did I do wrong with life? Just wonderful, wonderful people. My wife was the greatest woman in the world and my grandkids was excellent, them kids, they're the smartest kids in their school. They give them top honors on everything. It just -- it kills me. All I think about is him talking to me and begging me to come and get them out of the fire and he just -- he's kept saying grandpa come get me, come and get us. Come get us. Please come and get us. Now, all I could say was I'm just down the road. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. But they only wouldn't let me through there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VANIER: Meanwhile, a second firefighter has died battling the Ferguson fire near Yosemite National Park. That blaze has torched 22,000 hectares. It is currently 30 percent contained. These are just two of the 17 fires burning up and down California. Our Dan Simon has the latest from one of the worst-hit neighborhoods.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For the first time we're now beginning to hear fire officials expressed optimism about the overall effort. They indicated that the containment number is going to go up. That means that the resources that they put into this fire now seem to be working. You have about 3,500 firefighters on the frontlines and obviously a lot of aircraft dumping water on the hotspots. In the meantime, we are in the Lake Redding Estates subdivision and you can see this is one of the homes that has been destroyed. You can see this is a two-car garage.</p><p>You see the two vehicles right here and underscore the random nature but all you can see next door. You see this house that is perfectly intact. You have 38,000 people that are under an evacuation order. You have these people who are very restless. Obviously, they want to try to get back into their homes and people, of course, have hopes to get back into. You can't get a hotel in the area. It's just impossible and some of the evacuation shelters have also reached maximum capacity. But now that this containment number seems to be going up hopefully it means that fire crews will soon have this place under control.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VANIER: Earlier, I spoke to Brian Rice, the President of California Professional Firefighters and I asked him what makes this car fire so dangerous.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN RICE, PRESIDENT, CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS: It's intermixed right on the border of the city of Redding, it's community of about 100,000. You're talking about grass, tall grass, a lot of timber debris, and then timber also, then the other piece of it is the weather has very much been against firefighters. We're starting to see a little bit of change but the daytime temperatures have exceeded 105 degrees and in a couple -- last couple of days have actually been over at about 110 and the fuel moistures are incredibly dry, single- digit humidity and all of that is a very explosive combination for the firefighters that are on the line tonight.</p><p>[01:05:19] VANIER: But Brian, is it easier for you to fight the fire at night? That is my understanding.</p><p>RICE: Yes, it is. In fact, today on the car fire, we're getting a little bit of relief from the weather. The winds aren't quite as high as they were. We are seeing the temperatures drop and what that's going to lead to is what we would say the fire is going to lay down a little bit, meaning the firefighters can do a far more aggressive attack and that has been the strategy change over the last 24 -- about 36 hours that they're really shifting into a posture of an offensive fire attack instead of being completely defensive and trying to save lives.</p><p>VANIER: It's easy to get the impression if you look at this year and last summer as well that these fires are getting worse. They're worse now than they used to be. Is that -- is that fair? Are you getting the same impression?</p><p>RICE: I would say that every firefighter in California would probably agree with that. You know, we're in the midst of a long-term drought. Some of these areas haven't burned in you know, up to a decade and you know, just this year we have firefighters on the fire line on Christmas. In my 30-year career, this is the first time I can say that the fire season has extended from 2017-2018 (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>VANIER: So do firefighters need more resources than in light of this, in light of this harsher fire environment?</p><p>RICE: I mean, the easy answer, Cyril, it's yes. Right now in the state of California, our Fire Departments, both our state fire department and our local government fire departments were stretch very, very thin. Many departments have not recovered their staffing strength that they had prior to the great recession so we are seeing some staffing shortages badly. And then the explosive fire behavior that (INAUDIBLE) they're all contributors to it.</p><p>VANIER: Brian Rice, thank you so much for joining us on the show today. Thanks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VANIER: CNN Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri joins us now from the CNN Weather Center with the latest on the fire conditions. Pedram, what do you have?</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: You know, there is some improving weather conditions in store there. We're watching this very carefully of course because when you take a look at how things are going to play out here, the satellite imagery kind of shows you exactly what we're looking at. From space, looking down towards the San Joaquin Valley across this region, the haze, the smoke, it's all present there so we know the conditions certainly have been dire in the last couple of days, the pollutants very high in the atmosphere.</p><p>We're waiting for a pattern change here on the weather for the temps to cool off, the winds to die down and of course maybe some rain in the forecast. Unfortunately, not all of those on is coming together. But you take a look, certainly, some improving conditions are going to be in store and still at five percent containment but again as you heard firefighters saying and the officials saying that conditions are going to be more favorable to at least gain some ground on that but farther towards the southeast. The (INAUDIBLE) fire upwards of about 30 percent contained and also similar numbers coming in for the Ferguson fire farther towards the east as well. But talk about nearly 90 wildfires that are large in scale across the western United States, almost every single one of them exacerbated because of the drought scenario across that region.</p><p>And you notice, not much going on as far as the eastern U.S. is concerned. Not much in the way of drought, not much in the way of wildfire. So the weather pattern looks as such here. And of course when you go down and look at the lay of the land, really doesn't help because a lot of these fires are set up on very elevated terrain and oftentimes when you look at landscape like this it'll tend to increase the speed at which the fire grows is it goes upstream, kind of I use the analogy of taking a lighter or a match and lighting and I should say holding it next to your finger if you kind of bend that and give it a little bit of a slope if you'll notice the flames burning towards your finger much more rapidly. The same sort of a setup here occurs with every 10-degree increase in slope on an elevated terrain.</p><p>So if the fire is traveling at 20 km/h at 20 degrees slope, you bump that up just by 10 degrees in slope, you'll double the speed of the wildfire, precisely what happens when you kind of bend that match on your finger there and see the fire burn rapidly towards your finger so that sort of a pattern is taking place across this elevated terrain. Of course, the 40 degrees is helping. The conditions are going to remain locally gusty. Because of the extreme temperatures and the fire is on the ground there, we're going to see gusty winds generated through to the extreme heat in these mountain terrains. And then we know the drought situation remains moderate. Unfortunately no rain in the forecast as well. And both also seen reports of fire whirls or fire nato's as their call here across this region as intense heat is generated near the ground, Cyril.</p><p>We're getting all of that energy of the heat kind of rushing in like a vacuum towards the center. All of that air wants to rise and you get these vortices that spin up that are essentially a fireboard of seas that move downstream. They toss embers farther downstream making it really a difficult scenario for firefighters here to try to get some ground on these fires. But you notice the temperature trend remains into the lower 40s but then we see a noticeable drop there down into the upper 30s as we go in towards Wednesday. So that brings in some improvement and hopefully, with that, we'll see a little improvement and the humidity is being bumped up as well, Cyril, so Mother Nature at least maybe giving us a little bit of a break here later in the week.</p><p>[01:10:36] VANIER: All right, Pedram Javaheri, marshaling the resources of the weather center here at CNN. Pedram, we appreciate it. Thank you. And last week it was another wildfire we were telling you about. The families in Greece and now trying to rebuild after that blaze which killed more than 80 people and devastated villages.</p><p>This was shot by a resident as the flames were coming in. He only realize that he got trapped outside his house when the wind slammed his door shut. He could feel the heat on his head so he grabbed a bucket of water and doused himself. The flames were so intense he said that he was dry again in seconds. Thankfully the man was able was able to call someone in the house and get to safety.</p><p>A critical moment for the future of Zimbabwe, the country's first election since former President Robert Mugabe was ousted but he is not going out quietly and is taking a jab at his former party.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are going to build a great border wall. President Trump threatening to shut down the government if he doesn't get the border wall that he promised his voters. It could be a bruising political battle for Republicans with the midterm elections just around the corner</p><p>VINCE CELLINI, CNN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS ANCHOR: I'm Vince Cellini with your CNN World Sports headlines and what a ride. The Tour de France says a new champion Geraint Thomas says become the first Welshman to win cycling's most prestigious bicycle race. Thomas proved to be the strongest rider over the 2,082 miles spread over 21 stages. And the 32-year-old beat out Dutchman Tom duMoulin by one minute, 51 seconds and teammate Chris Froome by two minutes 24 seconds. At Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton had a bit of an advantage over his rivals. He loves the race and no one has led more laps on his track than he has.</p><p>[01:15:01] He easily closed out his sixth win at the Hungarian Grand Prix. The drama happened behind him. His teammate, Valtteri Bottas, kept running into trouble. First, clipping the back of Sebastian Vettel as the Ferrari passed him toward the end. And then, he ran into the side of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. Bottas ended up in fifth place.</p><p>Manchester United will kick off their Premier League season in less than two weeks, but they are nowhere near midseason form. Jose Mourinho's men went up against their Premier League rivals, Liverpool, in front of over a hundred thousand fans in Michigan. They were thrashed, 4-1, thanks in large part to the stunning overhead kick from their newly signed Xherdan Shaqiri. And that is a look at your sports headlines. I'm Vince Cellini.</p><p>VANIER: There are just a hundred days until the U.S. midterm elections and the President Trump is returning to a main campaign issue that fired up his voters in 2016, namely his promise to build a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We are going to build a great border wall. We will build a great, great wall. We're going to build a wall, don't worry about it. I worked on of this. I promise we will build the wall. And who's going to pay for the wall?</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: Mexico!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VANIER: So, who's going to build that wall again? President Trump apparently expects Congress now to put the bill. And he's threatening a government shutdown if he doesn't get his way. Tweeting today, \"I would be willing to shut down the government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for border security which include the wall.</p><p>Meanwhile, more than 700 children separated from their parent at the border still have not been reunited with their families after the court-ordered reunification deadline passed on Friday. Our Kaylee Hartung has more from McAllen, Texas.</p><p>KAYLEE HARTUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As we've reported on the impact of President Trump's zero-tolerance policy, we've learned that no two family stories are the same. But there have been some common threads among them that is confusion and frustration. At times chaos and incredible challenges in communication.</p><p>The story that best encapsulates where we are today though is that of a woman we'll call Alejandra. About a month and a half ago, she and her six-year-old daughter crossed the U.S. border. They had fled their home country of Honduras because of the gang violence there.</p><p>When they crossed the border, they were detained and separated. 11 days ago, Alejandra was told that she would be reunited with her daughter later that day given her paperwork for release. But that never happened.</p><p>As of today, she continues to sit in a detention facility in Texas. Her daughter remains in New York. And as Alejandra asks questions as she sits in limbo, here's what she says she's told.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEJANDRA, ASYLUM SEEKER (through translator): The first thing that I ask is always, \"Do you know when will be my girl will be brought here so she can be reunified with me?\" And they tell me, \"No, I don't know anything,\" they say to me.</p><p>HARTUNG: Alejandro's daughter's attorney has been told a red flag has been raised in the child's case. HHS says they won't comment on specific cases. But a spokesperson tells CNN that any family who hasn't been reunited yet is because of specific concerns they have for that family. As I said, no two stories are alike, but frustration remains for so many. Kaylee Hartung, CNN, McAllen, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VANIER: Amid an increasingly bitter trade dispute, we've learned that the America first president is producing his re-election campaign flags in China.</p><p>The manager of a factory in an eastern province tells Reuters that they have made some 90,000 of these, the banners that since March. That looks like them, all right.</p><p>But an official for Mr. Trump's reelection campaign actually says that they must be knockoffs because he insists that 100 percent of their merchandise is made in the USA.</p><p>President Trump's stance on immigration is just one area of agreement that he has with Italy's Prime Minister. The two men will meet at the White House on Monday, and the atmosphere is expected to be much warmer than recent talks Mr. Trump has had with other European leaders. Delia Gallagher, reports.</p><p>DELIA GALLAGHER, CNNVATICAN CORRESPONDENT: President Trump may see some European countries as foes, but in Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, he's got a friend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: Giuseppe's a new the Prime Minister of Italy is great, we got to meet him. Very strong on immigration like I am, by the way.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Closing ports and borders to illegal immigrants is one area where Trump in Italy see eye to eye. Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini visited the U.S. president in 2016 on the campaign trail, and written more than a few pages out of trumps playbook for his own election campaign, even the winning slogan, Italian's First.</p><p>More than 600,000 refugees most from North Africa have landed in Italy in recent years. But in June, more than 600 refugees at sea were turned away from Italy, Salvini was defiant. They will only see Italy on a postcard he said. They were eventually accepted in Spain.</p><p>Professor Federigo Argentieri, says Italy's government is similar to Trump's in random decision making and an apparent incoherent plan.</p><p>[01:20:28] FEDERIGO ARGENTIERI, DIRECTOR, GUARINI INSTITUTE, JOHN CABOT UNIVERSITY: Trump has understood or at least is being told that Italy must be coddled, so to speak. Because it's-- so far, the only -- the only real similarity in Western Europe.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Although Italy has refused Trump's request to give more money to NATO, they're behind the president in his support of Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Prime Minister Conte tweeted, \"I agree with the president, Russia should be back in the G8. Matteo Salvini's made no secret of his admiration for Putin, calling him one of the best politicians of our time. And publishing a photo on Facebook wearing a Putin T-shirt in Moscow's Red Square.</p><p>Italy's government coalition received 69 percent of the vote in March elections.

I don't have a problem with the present attacking certain people for admitting information or purposely not covering information, or downplaying certain things and accomplishments he's having.</p><p>I do -- I am concerned when you have entire broadband reach where people say all the media is evil are all the media is bad. I'm part of the media. I'm a commentator in the media. I'm at talk shows in the media. But I want it to be clear and concise when you're attacking the media -- it's something I've about this president for quite some time -- I don't want it be where all media is evil or all media is bad.</p><p>[01:29:55]</p><p>But at the same time, I do think that there are some in the media that are incredibly biased against this president and they act like they're not bias when they are doing some of the reporting.</p><p>VANIER: So Ellis -- supporters of the President and critics of the media -- and there are many in the U.S. would argue that Trump hasn't actually restricted the freedoms of the press, freedoms of the media so that there's no point over reacting to what are mere words. What do you think?</p><p>HENICAN: Now the words -- words matters. I mean this is the communication business. I don't think I'm an enemy of the people. And frankly, I don't think Ben is either although I don't want to rule out a short stay in reeducation camp, maybe.</p><p>No, but seriously guys. I mean this is dangerous stuff, you know. It's fine to have a debate. We all live -- we love having a robust back and forth and all kind of different opinions being expressed. That's what this country is all about.</p><p>But when you start trying to delegitimize, in effect, kind of threaten -- I mean let's be honest. A lot of this stuff really is threatening. You're in some dangerous territory. He needs to stop this right now.</p><p>FERGUSON: You know, I don't think it's dangerous territory because there is -- first of all the media should be challenged.</p><p>I mean you look at this president last week. He gets a new trade deal with the E.U. and doesn't get much credit of it. You had GDP at 4.1 percent when the media was writing articles in October before the election of '16 saying that the President has lost his mind that quote, \"pigs\" -- one economist was quoted as saying \"Pigs don't fly. The President is crazy or Donald Trump is crazy to think this is a possibility.\"</p><p>You had the Federal Reserve say the President was -- then-candidate Trump was also crazy and we can only expect 1.5 percent GDP growth and the President said -- responded with I'm going to give you tax cuts. I'm going to give you better trade deals. And I'm going to give more manufacturing jobs, America. That's how we get to 4 percent.</p><p>Where is the media talking about how the President was right about that? So when he is upset or frustrated that he doesn't feel like he's getting a fair shake on these types of issues. I think he has a legitimate point to be making there</p><p>VANIER: So if I can jump in -- a couple of things about that -- Ben.</p><p>Because we were dealing with that news and we did report all of that news some of time. Some of the time, the President, I want so say from a media coverage standpoint tends to shoot himself in the foot because he goes out and says something which is totally unnecessary which we have to cover because it's a tweet it's a sound bite of the President and he is the President of the United States.</p><p>And then we end up instead of talking about the economy which admittedly is doing great we ended up talking about a number of things including the economy but not just that.</p><p>So to that point --</p><p>FERGUSON: I agree.</p><p>VANIER: Hold on. To that point, I want to play to you the President's short-lived communications adviser Anthony Scaramucci. He was speaking to my colleague Jake Tapper earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER: Having a war declaration or having that level of antagonism with the press does not help the President, does not serve his interests going into midterms or the reelection.</p><p>I understand the frustration. I understand the President's personality where he likes to punch back and he likes to be combative. But what I think that also does -- and Jake, you'd probably agree with me in this -- it galvanizes the press vis a vis the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VANIER: So this is my question, and I want to hear both of you on this, this is a strategy by the White House, right, to engage in confrontation with the media.</p><p>My question is wouldn't he be better served by cultivating a more appeased relationship with the media?</p><p>Ellis -- you first.</p><p>HENICAN: Yes, clearly. I mean the Mooch is right. And listen, there's a distinction that the both of us need to make, I think. There's a difference between debating, combating or arguing with or offering to share a perspective and trying to delegitimize.</p><p>And that's really what this is about. Enemy of the people -- I mean that is -- that's despot talk. That's not two reasonable people disagreeing about whether someone's being fair to a politician or not. That's -- this is a whole different level which is frankly why I do call it dangerous.</p><p>VANIER: Ben -- on the specific issue of whether this is the best political strategy, confronting the media like that. Do you think it works?</p><p>FERGUSON: Scaramucci and I and others have said that we thought there should be a different strategy and clearly it has not been the strategy that has worked for this President. I thought he was too combative during the primaries, yet it worked. I thought he was too combative during the general election, yet it worked.</p><p>I thought he was too combative once he became the President yet it seems to be working. I mean Donald Trump is a different person. And one of the best things I've ever heard is let Trump be Trump and you're not going to change that.</p><p>And when the President gets angry at the media for the way he feels like they're covering an issue or over exaggerating one issue and under covering another one, he's going to call them out every time.</p><p>[01:39:55] And Scaramucci, with all due respect to him -- look I think Scaramucci would love to be a member of the media right now which is what I think he's auditioning for. It's like watching \"The Apprentice\" except in real time. He's dying to be relevant again since he lost that big job. And so, of course, he's going to side with the media right now.</p><p>But I promise you if he was in the White House --</p><p>VANIER: Well, hey Ben -- to his credit.</p><p>FERGUSON: -- right now --</p><p>VANIER: To his credit, when he was --</p><p>FERGUSON: He would be saying the opposite of this.</p><p>VANIER: I'm not sure. To his credit when he was White House communications director, he gave that one big press conference to sort of herald his new job and the coming of Scaramucci to the White House --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes, but --</p><p>VANIER: -- and he did start to cultivate a better relationship with the media.</p><p>I want to bring up --</p><p>FERGUSON: -- you remember what cost him his job. It's what cost him his job was him ripping on people and using foul language. So the idea that, you know, Scaramucci was going to do it differently, I laugh it. It's what cost him his job.</p><p>VANIER: I want to bring up one specific instance that occurred this week. Earlier this week the White House barred a CNN reporter from attending an open press event ostensibly because they simply did not like her questions to the President earlier that day.</p><p>Listen to Shepard Smith, anchor on the normally Trump-friendly Fox News. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHEPARD SMITH, FOX NEWS HOST: When the President attacks journalists, we question his motivation and try to discover the underlying reason, for historically those who regularly and as a matter of pattern attack the messenger, who degrade and belittle the purveyors of truth, and work to diminish the free press often find the facts displeasing and endeavor to keep you from knowing them. We are on guard and we hope politics aside, for the greater good, that you are too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VANIER: Ellis -- if you look at the short history of this administration, you kind of know you've crossed a red line when you have Fox calling you out.</p><p>HENICAN: It is. It almost makes me uncomfortable honestly. Yes. Everything in the media makes us want to compete with each other and throw punches at each other. But this is something that we all do or hold (INAUDIBLE). I know Ben's going to join me in this one.</p><p>We've got to ask tough questions of every politician. We cannot tolerate our colleagues being tossed out because they ask questions the administration doesn't like. This is what we do. It's defined in the constitution and it makes America better. We need to stick together.</p><p>VANIER: Ben -- real quick, last words.</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes, look. You can disagree with members of the press. You can call them out on it. You can have a meeting with them. You can say that you thought they badger the President and ask the same question too many times in a setting.</p><p>But you don't ban them. I actually agree with Ellis. I agree with many of my colleagues all over the country in different news organizations including Shepard Smith on this one. I don't think banning a reporter is a good look for this White House. I don't think saying you're not going to get invited to this is a good look for this White House.</p><p>You can call them out. You can let the public decide if it was appropriate or not. You can have a meeting for decorum issues but just saying you're gone and you're going to sit out this one, I just don't think it served the President well. I think it gave many people that don't like this President something to talk about. I think it was just a bad moment for this White House from the communications standpoint and I doubt they'll do it again.</p><p>VANIER: Ben, Ellis -- you agree. That doesn't happen very week. Listen -- thank you very much.</p><p>HENICAN: I like it.</p><p>VANIER: It's always a pleasure talking to you -- thanks.</p><p>HENICAN: Good seeing you.</p><p>FERGUSON: Thanks.</p><p>VANIER: Polls opened in Zimbabwe this hour and it will be a major test for the strength of the country's democracy. It's the first election since former President Robert Mugabe was ousted under military threat after ruling the country for 37 years.</p><p>You're watching live pictures right now.</p><p>And on the eve of the election Mugabe turned his back on the party he helped create, the ZANU-PF. And instead suggested that he would support the main opposition.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT MUGABE, FORMER PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE: I have also said Mujuru (ph) and Khuphe (ph) don't offer very much. So there is Chamisa left. ZANU-PF -- I can't vote for ZANU-PF.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VANIER: Mugabe said he can't support those who quote, \"brought me into this state\" alluding of course to his ouster. Mugabe's late announcement is seen as a political stab in the back of his successor.</p><p>Up next the tragedy that this species can ill afford -- the death of a polar bear off Norway is making people look again at how the animals might be kept from human harm.</p><p>Plus Britain battles \"fake news\" -- Lawmakers are setting their sights on social media companies to stop the spread of misinformation.</p><p>[01:39:38] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VANIER: A Palestinian teenager who became a symbol of resistance is back home with her family. Ahed Tamimi was released from an Israeli prison on Sunday after serving an eight months' sentence for assaulting an Israeli soldier.</p><p>In a news conference after her release she was defiant saying her fight against Israeli occupations continues. She was arrested in December when this video emerged of her slapping and kicking Israeli soldiers after her teenage cousin was allegedly shot by Israeli forces.</p><p>CNN's Ian Lee has more on Tamimi's homecoming in the West Bank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IAN LEE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): It's quite the celebration here in Nabi Saleh, Ahed Tamimi's hometown. You can see her picture is on the walls, also that of Nariman, her mother. Flags lie in the street but it wasn't your typical homecoming. There's a lot of symbolism. The first stop she made was to the house of a family member who died, to pay her respects. The second stop was to the grave of former Palestinian president Yasser Arafat where she laid a wreath.</p><p>Then she met the current Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and she brought up a couple of issues that are closer. That of Palestinians who are in the Israeli prison-- she'd like to see continued support for them. The other thing she brought up was Palestinian unity. And there is a split between Fattah and Hamas. She urged the Palestine president do lay aside their differences and come together in unity.</p><p>After that she came here to her hometown where she was greeted by family members, by friends as well as the international press. And when asked what she plans to do next, we have remember, this is a girl who went into prison at 16. She came out at 17. She graduated high school in prison.</p><p>She says her next step is going to college. She says she wants to learn and study law so she can help Palestinians who are in her position or could become in her position in the future.</p><p>Ian Lee, CNN -- Nabi Saleh, the West Bank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[01:45:02] VANIER: Outrage is growing in some corners after a polar bear was killed by a guard from a cruise ship. The image we're about to air of the dead bear might be disturbing to some. So I want to give you a head's up.</p><p>This happened on Saturday in an area known as the realm of the polar bears between mainland Norway and the North Pole.</p><p>The German cruise ship company says four guards were on land leading tourists off the ship when the polar bear attacked the guard and another guard shot it in self-defense. The guard was airlifted out with head injuries but he is expected to recover.</p><p>Meanwhile environmental activists are coming to the bear's defense. Wildlife expert Jeff Corwin spoke to CNN earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF CORWIN, WILDLIFE EXPERT: They are critically endangered and are slipping towards extinction. So when there's only 25,000 polar bears left on the planet, every one matters.</p><p>This is a species that you've just said, accurately so, is under distress. It is being stressed because its environment is changing because of warming seas. The perennial ice that these bears depend upon has all but disappeared. This is ice that's supposed to be there permanently.</p><p>A polar bear has the ability to swim 60 miles a day, yet they are drowning in open water because the ancient ice they relied on (INAUDIBLE) has gone away. So yes, oftentimes we now (INAUDIBLE) polar bears foraging and hunting for food that they normally would not need.</p><p>But this is polar bear habitat -- Fredricka. This is a place where we know they live. So when you are in this ecosystem as a tourist or as an explorer, as a scientist, you have the responsibility to follow the protocols to ensure that you stay safe and don't interfere with the wild behavior.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VANIER: Now the German cruise line has apologized for the incident.</p><p>Members of the British Parliament are warning that fake news is a threat to democracy. The committee investigating the issue wants the government to stop using that term altogether preferring misinformation instead. And it is calling for greater regulation of social media.</p><p>CNN's Samuel Burke has been working on this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: It's a blueprint for regulation sure to reverberate across Silicon Valley, this 89-page report released Sunday by a British parliamentary committee.</p><p>The report called on companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to face financial and legal liability when they fail to police fake news on their platforms.</p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, BRITISH COMMONWEALTH MP: We have to correct this sense of liability for them to say that if you don't proactively look for and monitor harmful content, and I think they ought to classify the real hard fake news, real lies being spread during election as harmful content.</p><p>If you don't act to identify that and the sources then you could be liable for that information having been spread. I think if we introduce that liability as law, we'll see them take it more seriously.</p><p>BURKE: The committee recommended new taxes on social media companies and stiff fines when they promote political ads that lack transparency.</p><p>COLLINS: The tech companies are saying themselves they want to give more transparency. What we could do is write it into our laws.</p><p>BURKE: If adopted the recommendations would radically change the way tech companies are treated in the U.K. less like passive platforms and more like publishers.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.</p><p>BURKE: But British lawmakers said they weren't satisfied with efforts by social media companies to regulate themselves.</p><p>COLLINS: What they do is they pre-empt regulation. They don't like being regulated. So if they think the threat of regulation is real they will try and design their own way of solving the problem.</p><p>BURKE: The committee which has been working closely with members of the U.S. Congress also proposed measures to combat election interference and it slammed Facebook in particular for failing to fully investigate how and if Russia uses its platform to influence voters.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook said, \"The committee has raised some important issues. We share the goal of ensuring that political advertising is fair and transparent and that electoral rule changes are needed. We will work closely with the U.K. government as we develop these new transparency tools.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST: The chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg is $16 billion poorer than when he woke up this morning.</p><p>BURKE: Last week, the stock prices at Facebook and Twitter each fell almost 20 percent after both companies said they were spending heavily to combat misinformation and clean up fake accounts on their platforms.</p><p>COLLINS: You look to the near future and this problem is probably going to get worse using, you know, virtual reality, augmented reality (ph) techniques, you can already create fake speech given by someone in a place they never were with an audience they never met. They'll pass it off as real and share that online.</p><p>Now, we're going to need the help of the tech companies to stop that sort of information spreading, otherwise that could have a real outcome on elections in the future.</p><p>BURKE: Big tech's willingness to help out will surely be tested now that regulation is going to closer to becoming law.</p><p>Samuel Burke, CNN -- London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VANIER: The latest viral trend of people hopping out of cars to the tune of a Drake song. #InMyFeelings challenge.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>[01:50:02] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, AMS METEOROLOGIST: A tale of two different stories across portions of the United States. You slice the U.S. in half and you see what's happening on the Eastern periphery, it's all about the clouds, the storms, the thunderstorms in the afternoon hours; while the western United States is all abut sunny weather and also extreme heat that's been in place literally across much of that region. But notice this -- tremendous amount of moisture really east of the Mississippi over the next couple of days. We're talking 50 to 100 millimeters widespread. Some areas across the coastal region with the Carolinas there could see some -- see some downpours there going in towards the beginning of this week.</p><p>New York City cools off a little, up to 27; Montreal same score with thunderstorms possible while (INAUDIBLE) places across say Denver, upper 20s. Otherwise Vancouver, British Columbia -- what an incredibly hot July. I think they're going to wrap that up here and maybe bring in some cooler weather as we bring the month of August in.</p><p>But you notice around the Midwestern U.S. if any comfortable readings have been in place they're going to gradually chip away at that. You're up into the 30s in St. Louis, up into the upper 20s around Chicago and even New York City sees a brief warming trend in store.</p><p>But this is where we're watching for some relief. Of course we know these firefighting efforts across northern places of California entering Oregon. But notice temps across Seattle and Portland had been at historic values. Going to see a cooling trend beginning the month of August there with temps dropping back toward seasonal values. While down to the Caribbean -- Havana around 32, Nassau 31 degrees.</p><p>VANIER: Ever find yourself bored while stuck at a traffic light? Well, a dance company in Mexico City decided to entertain drivers while they're waiting for the light to change. They're taking classical ballet to the streets.</p><p>Twirls, leaps are choreographed for 58-second performances -- the precise length of time for a Mexico City traffic light to turn green. The dancers belong to the Ardentia Theater Company and their street appearances have had a very positive response in the two weeks since they began.</p><p>Now, before we end up the show, I have been warned against reporting this next story, shamed in fact by younger colleagues in the NEWSROOM who told me that this would expose career ending ignorance of social media trends. Still I must.</p><p>If you are like me, you could be forgiven for wondering why things like this are popping up on your social media.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>VANIER: So random people hopping out of cars to dance to rapper, Drake's recent hit \"In My Feelings\". And by the way, if you don't know who Drake is, I can't help you at this point.</p><p>[01:55:02] This is called the Shiggy challenge and if you were cool, you probably would have done it three weeks ago and posted it on Twitter. Like these celebrities -- NFL star Odell Beckham, Jr.</p><p>And we've also got this one from singer Ciara and his famous boyfriend.</p><p>And Will Smith probably gets the medal for this one.</p><p>So just to set the record straight, it all started with social media borderline celebrity Shiggy. He posted this.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>VANIER: And it just took off from there, the rest is history. However, not everyone is playing it safe -- ouch. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is actually taking this seriously and they're urging people not to jump out of their cars to dance.</p><p>They call this, I wonder why -- they call this foolish and dangerous.</p><p>That's it from us. Thanks for watching CNN NEWSROOM. Have a great day.

Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) plan to break up large tech companies, which she discussed in a speech last Friday in Queens, positioned her as one of the most aggressive anti-monopolists running in a crowded Democratic field.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But while the proposal was meant to serve as a benchmark for others seeking the nomination, it managed to spark a tangible amount of interest in conservative quarters, where the perception exists that the social media giants are too powerful and liberal-oriented. On Tuesday, several of those conservatives found themselves doing the previously unthinkable: claiming common ground with a senator whom President Trump routinely mocks as a fraud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cDue to their rampant censorship, these companies risk radicalizing conservatives to support policies like what Elizabeth Warren is proposing and that will continue unless they start grappling with their inherent biases and the issue of censorship,\u201d said Andrew Surabian, Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s political adviser, who argued that conservatives could back Warren\u2019s proposal because of their own grievances with Silicon Valley.</p><p>Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), an ardent Trump ally, said he hadn\u2019t followed the specifics of Warren\u2019s proposal but said a similarly aggressive antitrust push from Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), the chair of a House antitrust subcommittee, could win bipartisan support.</p><p>\u201cCicilline in the House is going to go gangbusters on big tech and I'm excited to see what he puts together in legislation,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cIt may get lots of bipartisan support.\u201d</p><p>Even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) got in on the act, tweeting that Warren was \u201cright\u201d that tech giants have too much power while noting that Warren herself had ads on the matter removed from Facebook because of the use of the company\u2019s corporate logo.</p><p>First time I\u2019ve ever retweeted @ewarren But she\u2019s right\u2014Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech. They shouldn\u2019t be censoring Warren, or anybody else. A serious threat to our democracy. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/VoesOKSqhA\">https://t.co/VoesOKSqhA</url></p><p>\u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 12, 2019 </p><p>Beyond the overtures from GOP lawmakers and top Trump advisers, elements of the online right also cheered on Warren\u2019s call to break up the tech giants. On \u201cThe Donald,\u201d the leading pro-Trump forum on Reddit, posters praised the senator\u2019s proposal\u2014in part because they expected that it would alienate Democrats from wealthy Silicon Valley donors.</p><p>\u201cWatch Google and Amazons political ideologies change overnight,\u201d predicted one post that received more than 1,000 votes in support.</p><p>Warren\u2019s goal is hardly to alienate Big Tech from the Democratic Party, though she most likely will not win plaudits in Silicon Valley for the argument that Facebook, Amazon and Google had \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d</p><p>The Massachusetts Democrat had two specific prescriptions for ending what she viewed as the monopoly these companies enjoyed. The first was to pass legislation that would designate a new category for large companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more that \u201coffer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties.\u201d Warren proposes that those companies be classified as \u201cplatform utilities,\u201d and be prohibited from both owning the platform and any of its participants. Additionally, under her plan, the utilities would have to \u201cmeet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users,\u201d and they would not be allowed to share or transfer data to third parties. Warren suggested that the Amazon Marketplace, Google\u2019s ad exchange, and Google Search would turn into platform utilities.</p><p>The second aspect Warren suggested was appointing regulators to undo recent mergers like Amazon\u2019s ownership of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook\u2019s ownership of WhatsApp and Instagram and Google\u2019s ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>\u201cWe have these giant tech companies that think they rule the earth,\u201d Warren declared at a boisterous rally in Queens on Friday night, where Amazon had intended building half of its second headquarters before folding in the face of local and national resistance. \u201cThey think they can come to towns, cities, states and bully everyone into doing what they want.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Trust Busting, FTW</p><p>How Democrats Learned to Love Being Anti-Monopoly</p><p>Sam Stein,</p><p>Gideon Resnick</p><p>Though Warren\u2019s regulatory agenda has long been an object of ridicule for conservatives, many flocked to her call to break up the tech giants, which they view with increasing suspicion. In particular, conservatives have grown increasingly convinced that social media companies are engaged in a pattern of shadow and even overt censorship of their viewpoints\u2014through algorithmic changes to user feeds and even outright bans from the platforms.</p><p>Hot points have included the banning of right-wing provocateurs and a short-lived Twitter prohibition on a campaign ad from then-Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN). Last year, pro-Trump commentators \u201cDiamond &amp; Silk\u201d appeared at a congressional hearing to allege that Facebook was \u201cshadow-banning\u201d conservatives on social media to reduce their visibility.</p><p>Those tensions have prompted more calls from the right for the tech giants to be broken up. In 2017, conservative columnist Kurt Schlichter called for then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to assign Justice Department attorneys to \u201cbreaking up these enormous, bloated, anti-competitive conglomerates.\u201d And in language reminiscent of Warren\u2019s own progressive rhetoric, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">National Review</emphasis> writer Victor Davis Hanson has called the tech founders the \u201cnew robber barons.\u201d</p><p>Sarah Miller, deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, which advocates against corporate concentration and monopoly power, said that it was not surprising to find Republicans and Democrats agreeing about the pernicious effects of tech companies becoming more and more monopolistic.</p><p>\u201cThese corporations becoming more and more like private governments is just becoming more apparent to people on both sides of the aisle who are in democratically elected government,\u201d Miller told The Daily Beast, adding that part of their advocacy is centered on pushing the Federal Trade Commission to take more action.</p><p>With a growing conservative appetite for a proposal now being championed by a leading Democratic presidential candidate, President Trump could find himself in an odd position: forced to tiptoe around a signature policy of a lawmaker at which he\u2019s directed racist attacks. On Monday, that tiptoeing began. In an interview with Breitbart, the president called Warren\u2019s proposal \u201cfunny\u201d because of tech leaders\u2019 traditional support for Democrats.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny? Elizabeth Warren called for their total breakup,\u201d he said. \u201cI do smile, though, they\u2019re so protective of her.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u2014Sam Stein and Lachlan Markay contributed reporting </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2190798097</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMV-VTK1-DY0W-430G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1172\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He has accused Twitter of making it ``very hard for people to join me'' and ``very much harder for me to get out the message.'' He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators.Trump frequently lashes out at the press, and did so again Thursday, tweeting that, ``Fake News is not as important, or as powerful, as Social Media'' and predicting outlets ``will quickly go out of business'' when he leaves office. </p><p>He asserted that ``even Social Media would be driven out of business'' if he loses in 2020.The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election. <url normalizedValue=\"https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-07/AP_17104561831130.jpg?itok=v-R3yeU7FILE\">https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-07/AP_17104561831130.jpg?itok=v-R3yeU7FILE</url> - Christian Ziegler, the Florida Republican Party vice chairman photographed April 14, 2017, is among those expected to attend a social media summit Thursday in Washington. Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. But while some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet ``offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.''Its members' platforms ``don't have a political ideology or political bias,'' the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies ``succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.''Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, in a statement, said ``We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.''Thursday's conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants' market dominance. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121562857603639251764500193</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ7-DD01-DXN1-C27R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><timeReceived>3:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He was accompanied by Attorney General William Barr, who said the administration would also push legislation to rein in the online companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under the executive order, Trump said he is asking regulators to reinterpret a law that shields internet companies from lawsuits over content on their sites, a safeguard that has allowed Silicon Valley's giants to generate some of the world's biggest fortunes.</p><p>\"My executive order calls for new regulations ... to make it that social media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield,\" he said,</p><p>But any such action depends on independent agencies and state attorneys general agreeing with the administration's stance, and would certainly provoke a legal fight that would last long past November's election.</p><p>Trump told reporters he would gladly quit Twitter - the platform where he has amassed 80.4 million followers - if the mainstream media weren't biased against him. He has frequently used the platform to attack publications and individual news reports he deems \"fake.\" The White House pulled the trigger on the executive order targeting social media - an option it has floated in the past - after Twitter added fact-check warnings this week to two of Trump's posts containing inaccurate information about mail-in ballots. Twitter has said those posts violated its policies against misinformation about elections and other civic processes.</p><p>The president also singled out Yoel Roth, the head of site integrity for Twitter, holding up a cover of the New York Post with Roth's photo. Roth has drawn attacks from conservatives in recent days after people unearthed old tweets in which he appeared to disparage Trump and his supporters.</p><p>Both the order and the push for new legislation target Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 law that shields online platforms from liability for content created or shared by their users.</p><p>Barr declined to provide details on legislative effort, saying the department is considering options for what it will look like, but indicated litigation was likely on the horizon as well.</p><p>\"One of the things that I found has the broadest bipartisan support these days is the feeling that this provision, Section 230, has been stretched way beyond its original intention, and people feel that on both sides of the aisle,\" Barr said. Both Democrats and Republicans raised the prospect of changes to Section 230, though for opposite reasons. The Democrats want more fact-checking of misinformation and misleading posts, such as those by Trump that Twitter slapped with warning labels.</p><p>Vice President Joseph Biden's campaign called Trump's action an \"extreme abuse of power.\" Though Biden has argued for Section 230 to be revoked, arguing social media sites don't do enough to police misinformation, his campaign said Thursday that Trump is crafting policy for personal benefit.</p><p>\"It will not be the position of any future Biden Administration -- or any other administration that is aware of our basic constitutional structure -- that the First Amendment means private companies must provide a venue for, and amplification of, the President's falsehoods, lest they become the subject of coordinated retaliation by the federal government,\" said spokesperson Bill Russo.</p><p>The order drew condemnation even before it was finalized from both internet industry advocates and civil liberties groups, including some who regularly criticize Silicon Valley, after the language began circulating on social media and in news reports. Some called it dangerous to free speech; some dismissed it as bluster.</p><p>\"This reads like a stream of consciousness tweetstorm that some poor staffer had to turn into the form of an Executive Order,\" said Daphne Keller, a former Google attorney who now leads the Program on Platform Regulation at Stanford's Cyber Policy Center.</p><p>The order nevertheless adds more ammunition to a talking point that resonates with Trump's online base and will appease some Washington conservatives who are skeptical of the tech industry's influence over political discourse. And Trump's escalation of the issue could have a chilling effect on internet companies weighing whether to make rulings on misinformation or other content as Election Day nears.</p><p>\"This executive order is a naked attempt by the president to bully into silence Twitter, other social-media sites and anyone who attempts to correct or criticize Trump,\" said Gaurav Laroia, senior policy counsel at advocacy group Free Press, in a statement.</p><p>Twitter was just as unsparing in its response. \"This EO is a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law,\" the company's global public policy team tweeted late Thursday night. \"#Section230 protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it's underpinned by democratic values. Attempts to unilaterally erode it threaten the future of online speech and Internet freedoms.\"</p><p>Google and Facebook released statements defending their content policies and their handling of controversial posts, saying their decisions are not partisan.</p><p>\"We believe in protecting freedom of expression on our services, while protecting our community from harmful content including content designed to stop voters from exercising their right to vote. Those rules apply to everybody,\" Facebook said.</p><p>Section 230 is considered sacred in tech circles and many credit it for the rise of the modern internet. Lawmakers created the statute with the rationale that online sites are conduits of information, rather than publishers that pick and choose what content to offer - a principle Trump and Barr accuse the Big Tech platforms of violating.</p><p>\"It is the policy of the United States that the scope of that immunity should be clarified,\" the order declares.</p><p>The Trump administration argues that social media platforms forfeit those protections when they exercise editorial judgment, particularly after engaging in \"deceptive or pretextual actions restricting online content.\" It also directs the Commerce Department to request FCC rules determining when social media companies have not acted in \"good faith\" when restricting access to content, as Section 230 requires.</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said Thursday the agency will \"carefully review\" the rulemaking request, though last year he said that his agency does not have the authority to regulate social media under current law. His Republican colleague Commissioner Mike O'Rielly tweeted that the president \"has [the] right to seek review of statute's application.\"</p><p>Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel was not keen on the agency being drafted into Trump's social media war.</p><p>\"Social media can be frustrating. But an Executive Order that would turn the FCC into the President's speech police is not the answer,\" she tweeted before the final order was released. \"It's time for those in Washington to speak up for the First Amendment. History won't be kind to silence.\"</p><p>The FCC is legally independent of the president, although Trump appointed its five board members and elevated Pai to the chairmanship. Political power on the commission would shift, though, if Democrat Joe Biden wins the November election.</p><p>Congress wrote Section 230 in the mid-1990s, when the internet was still a newfangled thing for most Americans, and its implementation has been shaped in recent decades through court decisions. The administration's interpretation is likely to face legal challenges from both internet advocates and industry players.</p><p>Trump \"can't just unilaterally determine how a law can be interpreted, especially not with all of the years of precedent behind it,\" said Kate Klonick, a St. John's University assistant law professor who reviewed the order. \"So it's unlikely that the order will be upheld if there's like an injunction or it goes to the courts.\"</p><p>The executive order also moves to ban federal agencies from advertising through social networks that \"restrict free speech,\" and gives agencies 30 days to report their spending so the DOJ can evaluate whether they're paying platforms with \"viewpoint-based speech restrictions.\" That policy could restrict the government from advertising their services and programs, potentially even the U.S. Census, to millions of Americans on the platform.</p><p>Finally, it directs the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, in partnership with the Justice Department, to review whether internet companies have deceived or been unfair to users by censoring political speech beyond what they have publicly disclosed.</p><p>\"The FTC is committed to robust enforcement of consumer protection and competition laws, including with respect to social media platforms, and consistent with our jurisdictional authority and constitutional limitations,\" said Peter Kaplan, the agency's spokesperson.</p><p>The FTC has previously been reluctant to get involved in evaluating political speech, said Bill Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University.</p><p>\"For a regulator, this is exactly the kind of work you don't want to do,\" said Kovacic, who served as chairman of the FTC during the George W. Bush administration. The executive order does not require the agency to act. Even if it did do so, it does not have the authority to issue fines. It's most common action against companies is to order them to stop a practice the agency deems deceptive.</p><p>The White House gathered its own evidence of political bias last year when its Office of Digital Strategy created an online survey where people could submit examples of times they've felt big technology companies unfairly took action against them because of their views. The White House received 16,000 submissions at the time, and now plans to pass along complaints to the FTC, DOJ and state authorities, according to the executive order.</p><p>\"In a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand-pick the speech that Americans may access and convey online,\" the executive order reads. \"This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.\"</p><p>Trump has lost his own court battles over online speech. In 2017, Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute successfully sued the president after he blocked multiple Twitter users for criticizing his policies. An appeals court unanimously agreed Trump's actions violated the First Amendment.</p><p>Jameel Jaffer, the institute's executive director, said in a statement Thursday that Trump's executive order was \"born unconstitutional\" because it amounts to retaliation against Twitter for calling out the president's misleading tweets. Some of the provisions also raise constitutional concerns because they appear to punish the companies for decisions protected under the First Amendment.</p><p>\"There may well be regulation and legislation worth considering in this sphere, but whatever else this order may be, it is not a good faith effort to protect free speech online,\" Jaffer said.</p><p>The executive order marks an escalation of Trump's longstanding love-hate relationship with social media companies like Twitter and Facebook, which he has frequently accused of being biased against him but which also serve as his primary method of communication with supporters.</p><p>Indeed, Trump regularly turns to Twitter to pump up campaign rallies, attack political and personal rivals, pronounce new federal policies and tout forthcoming media appearances. His prolific use of the platform has helped him amass 80.3 million followers, more than any political leader except for former President Barack Obama.</p><p>But Trump and his allies have also accused the major social networks operating out of liberal Silicon Valley of censoring conservative speech and making it difficult to find or follow their accounts, a practice known as shadow banning. That perceived bias was the subject of a White House summit in July that brought together online pundits who have emerged as the president's most vocal advocates.</p><p>Barr said in December that the Justice Department would launch its own review of Section 230.</p><p>\"I was expecting this executive order to come at the end of that review,\" said Rachel Bovard, a senior adviser to the Internet Accountability Project, a conservative group partially funded by Oracle that is pushing for antitrust tech probes. \"I think Twitter's action sort of sped it up. And in that regard, Twitter just scored the biggest own goal in history.\"</p><p>John Hendel and Leah Nylen contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-288122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-HNX1-F118-904G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2181\"/><timeReceived>2:19 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The URL in question, G20.In, ends in the .in suffix often used for Indian websites and caused Twitter's automatic link parsing software to spring into action. Atlanta web designer and Pixel Riot founderJason Velazquez saw the opportunity for a jab at the modern political world, and bought up the URL, then put an anti-Trump message on the page. </p><p>Giuliani, seemingly thinking that Twitter was behind this and confused by the fact that the URL parser did not hyperlink a similar typo that did not contain a commonly used domain, sent out a followup Tweet accusing Twitter of being anti-Trump and calling for fairness.Background:Politicians in the Untied States, on the whole, tend to be on the older side, so it's not a stretch to logically conclude that most of them would not be terribly tech-savvy. Knowing the cause of this particular gaffe, for instance, requires knowledge of both the somewhat niche concept of cybersquatting, along with knowing that Twitter's link parser only picks up on commonly used domain names. The worrisome element here is in Giuliani's reaction to the whole affair, instantly assuming that Twitter[1] was to blame and accusing the company of political bias. This attitude toward Silicon Valley and the tech world in general is not hard to find among American lawmakers, and the saga of this Tweet is just further evidence of that. Many big names in the tech world, such as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, have grappled with this perception not just in the digital space and across miles, but sitting face-to-face with lawmakers, judges and more in courtrooms and meeting rooms.Impact:It's commonly known that tech knowledge is not generally a strong suit for American politicians as a group, but that didn't stop swarms of Twitter users from descending upon Giuliani's original Tweet and the subsequent reaction to put in their two cents. While the internet at large took a moment from this incident to laugh at what is ultimately the current decade's manifestation of a social convention that goes back thousands of years, being the older crowd having less of a grip on newer developments and technologies than the younger crowd, the implications here are no laughing matter. This incident, and similar ones, mark a disturbing trend of the US government trying to regulate and officially comment on[2] technology that it doesn't know much about. That, in turn, could lead to tone-deaf legislation and other political decisions surround the tech world. Big tech is growing more and more integrated with daily life each week, it seems, making this proposition quite worrisome. As of this writing, Giuliani has not taken down the Tweets, the G20.In link is still live with an anti-Trump message and relevant news article links, and Giuliani has yet to comment on the situation on Twitter. The usually Twitter-happy President[3] seemingly also has yet to comment on this situation in any official fashion.

Based on a few scant remarks from Trump such as opposing Apple's stance during its legal tussle with DOJ over unlocking a cellphone or supporting government surveillance, some said they weren't hopeful he would be an advocate for greater privacy. A drone lobbyist said Trump's pro-business and pro-technology approach will help his industry.</p><p>FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said during remarks at an International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) event in Brussels, where she noted the election results were a surprise (perhaps given recent polling), that she doesn't think that change in administration would affect the U.S. and EU work on Privacy Shield and related data protection and privacy issues. \"Historically, there has been less of a swing across administrations when it comes to agency priorities, so, there's no question in my mind that even in the face of a change in leadership, these issues will continue to be important,\" Ramirez said in IAPP's report. It said that she didn't \"fear or foresee an unraveling of the progress\" made between the EU and the U.S. under the Obama administration, the IAPP story said. Article 29 Working Party Chairwoman Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads France's data protection authority, was quoted as saying the relationship between the EU and the U.S. is valuable. \"It's a common subject we have together, and I hope the new administration is going to carry along the same lines.\"</p><p>Ryan Hagemann, Niskanen Center technology and civil liberties policy analyst, noted in an interview that Trump did call for a boycott on Apple regarding the encryption fight with the government to break into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters (see 1603290059). \"He's going to be something of a hawk on encryption and he's going to be very clearly on the side of law enforcement when those types of debates come up, which inevitably they will,\" Hagemann said: The president-elect's views on privacy and surveillance are a bit more unclear. Nearly a year ago, Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he would \"err on the side of security\" and essentially would reauthorize U.S. bulk collection and storage of phone metadata.</p><p>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology Vice President-Policy Chris Calabrese expects \"broad attacks\" on privacy and internet openness. He said Trump has \"staked out some pretty aggressive positions,\" citing the Apple fight. With Republicans remaining in control of the House and Senate and now taking the White House, Calabrese said he sees pro-surveillance policies becoming \"even more aggressive,\" pointing to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is a controversial provision that permits the government to conduct mass surveillance on people's communications (see 1605100001). That section is set to expire in December 2017 unless reauthorized. He said Trump may also make attempts to monitor the internet since he has talked about fighting radical Islamists.</p><p>Hagemann said on broader emerging technology issues, \"it's best to wait and see what happens.\" Trump has indicated a moratorium on new regulations (see 1608080045), but Hagemann said the incoming commander in chief hasn't surrounded himself with any big tech or telecom hitters other than American Enterprise Institute visiting scholar Jeffrey Eisenach (see 1611040057). Trump's \"going to have to sort of buckle down and get some wizened tech folks into his transition team and into his cabinet before we can actually get a clearer understanding of what a Trump administration's policy on these types of issues look like,\" Hagemann added.</p><p>Akin Gump Senior Policy Adviser Michael Drobac, a spokesman for the Small UAV Coalition, told us that Trump's pro-business stance and views on limiting regulations will have a positive effect on the drone industry when it comes to data security, privacy and safety (see 1609160003 and 1608260020).

Based on a few scant remarks from Trump such as opposing Apple's stance during its legal tussle with DOJ over unlocking a cellphone or supporting government surveillance, some said they weren't hopeful he would be an advocate for greater privacy. A drone lobbyist said Trump's pro-business and pro-technology approach will help his industry.</p><p>FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said during remarks at an International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) event in Brussels, where she noted the election results were a surprise (perhaps given recent polling), that she doesn't think that change in administration would affect the U.S. and EU work on Privacy Shield and related data protection and privacy issues. \"Historically, there has been less of a swing across administrations when it comes to agency priorities, so, there's no question in my mind that even in the face of a change in leadership, these issues will continue to be important,\" Ramirez said in IAPP's report. It said that she didn't \"fear or foresee an unraveling of the progress\" made between the EU and the U.S. under the Obama administration, the IAPP story said. Article 29 Working Party Chairwoman Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads France's data protection authority, was quoted as saying the relationship between the EU and the U.S. is valuable. \"It's a common subject we have together, and I hope the new administration is going to carry along the same lines.\"</p><p>Ryan Hagemann, Niskanen Center technology and civil liberties policy analyst, noted in an interview that Trump did call for a boycott on Apple regarding the encryption fight with the government to break into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters (see 1603290059). \"He's going to be something of a hawk on encryption and he's going to be very clearly on the side of law enforcement when those types of debates come up, which inevitably they will,\" Hagemann said: The president-elect's views on privacy and surveillance are a bit more unclear. Nearly a year ago, Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he would \"err on the side of security\" and essentially would reauthorize U.S. bulk collection and storage of phone metadata.</p><p>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology Vice President-Policy Chris Calabrese expects \"broad attacks\" on privacy and internet openness. He said Trump has \"staked out some pretty aggressive positions,\" citing the Apple fight. With Republicans remaining in control of the House and Senate and now taking the White House, Calabrese said he sees pro-surveillance policies becoming \"even more aggressive,\" pointing to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is a controversial provision that permits the government to conduct mass surveillance on people's communications (see 1605100001). That section is set to expire in December 2017 unless reauthorized. He said Trump may also make attempts to monitor the internet since he has talked about fighting radical Islamists.</p><p>Hagemann said on broader emerging technology issues, \"it's best to wait and see what happens.\" Trump has indicated a moratorium on new regulations (see 1608080045), but Hagemann said the incoming commander in chief hasn't surrounded himself with any big tech or telecom hitters other than American Enterprise Institute visiting scholar Jeffrey Eisenach (see 1611040057). Trump's \"going to have to sort of buckle down and get some wizened tech folks into his transition team and into his cabinet before we can actually get a clearer understanding of what a Trump administration's policy on these types of issues look like,\" Hagemann added.</p><p>Akin Gump Senior Policy Adviser Michael Drobac, a spokesman for the Small UAV Coalition, told us that Trump's pro-business stance and views on limiting regulations will have a positive effect on the drone industry when it comes to data security, privacy and safety (see 1609160003 and 1608260020).

In a somewhat contradictory interview with Axios[1], the 45th President of the United States also argued that the three tech giants were great companies, but his quotes included vaguewarnings about looking into regulating the three. The president refused to give any definitive answers when asked about Google, Facebook and Amazon enjoying a monopoly, highlighting his seemingly muddled view on the tech industry and leaving many in Silicon Valley unsure where they or the US government stands. </p><p>\"I leave it to others, but I do have a lot of people talking about monopoly when they mention those three in particular,\" he said. \"We are looking at antitrust very seriously. \"Look, that doesn't mean we're doing it, but we're certainly looking and I think most people surmise that I would imagine.\" Trump was pushed on the issue and asked if his administration would ever break the companies up, but again he didn't commit to a definitive answer. \"They were talking about this years' ago, you know, they were actually talking this same subject, monopoly, years ago, long before I was in office. A lot of people thought it was going to happen, but then I guess the previous administration stopped it from happening,\" Trump said.Previously the president has taken issue with Google, which he claimed rigged its search engine against politically conservative viewpoints[2]. \"Google search results for \"Trump News\" shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me ...hers, so that almost all stories ...ws is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative ...ir Media is shut out. Illegal?\" he tweeted.But, after the EU fined Google \u20ac4.3 billion following a lengthy antitrust investigation[3] into its Android mobile operating system, the President sided with the US tech giant saying: \"The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google. They truly have taken advantage of the US, but not for long!\" The subject was brought up again in the interview, but this time Trump was less complimentary towards Google and instead suggested that it should be his administration imposing regulatory actions - despite not confirming whether there would be any. \"You look at the European Union, they fined, I guess it was Google, billions of dollars and frankly I don't like that they're doing that because that's an American company,\" he said. \"I don't think it's good that they're doing that. But if anybody does that, that should be us doing it. That shouldn't be the European Union.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-big-tech-google-amazon-facebook-957600ac-2d45-476c-a5ee-9bf534c85f80.html\">https://www.axios.com/trump-big-tech-google-amazon-facebook-957600ac-2d45-476c-a5ee-9bf534c85f80.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/network-internet/31790/google-denies-trumps-claim-that-its-meddling-with-search-results\">https://www.itpro.co.uk/network-internet/31790/google-denies-trumps-claim-that-its-meddling-with-search-results</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/google-android/31551/trump-slams-eus-38bn-android-antitrust-fine\">https://www.itpro.co.uk/google-android/31551/trump-slams-eus-38bn-android-antitrust-fine</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DENS1336351541417154259251766500230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DENS-133635</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TN9-GRS1-JCMN-Y1P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"526\"/><timeReceived>11:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Pro</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 5, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Laura Ingraham  and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE.  We have a jam-packed show for you tonight.   Busy primary tonight across the country.  And we'll give you some hints  about what November might look like.  This includes an extremely razor thin  margin in Ohio's 12th district.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former governor Mike Huckabee is also here to react to a loony left wing --  Rosie O'Donnell's latest stunt in front of the White House.  You could  almost hear it last night from our set.  Plus the president's legal team  expected to respond to Robert Mueller's demands as early as tomorrow.  So  that's news.  Dershowitz is here to tell us what should and should not be  included.  And Representative Steve Scalise joins us exclusively on the  increasing hostile that republicans face these days, including a death  threat that he just received.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, big tech and the new corporate censorship.  That's the focus of  tonight's ANGLE.  Remember what Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told the  Senate hearing back in April? </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  There's certain content that clearly, we  do not allow.  Hate speech, terrorist content, nudity, anything that makes  people feel unsafe in the community.  From that perspective, that's what we  generally try to refer to what we do as a platform for all ideas.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  A platform for all ideas.  Really?  Over the past few months,  Facebook and other tech giants have given us ample reasons to doubt that  proclamation.  The latest example started early yesterday morning when  Apple pulled several podcasts associated with the controversial and  incendiary Alex Jones.  Facebook followed suite, unpublishing four of  Jones' pages, claiming that the videos on those pages violated that hate  speech policy.  Hours later YouTube decided it wasn't going to miss out on  all that censorship fun and YouTube suspended the Alex Jones channel with  its 2.4 million subscribers.  </p><p>Well it's easy to dismiss concerns about big techs actions all coordinated  it seems to shut down Jones, because of course, he's the media's poster  child for conspiracy theories.  But this isn't about Alex Jones.  This is  about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as  individuals trust and like.  If big tech can control the information flow,  then they can also perhaps even influence the outcome of the midterms and  even future presidential elections.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Essentially, Alex Jones has been deleted, digitally  deplatformed from these websites, you wonder if he'll have any influence  going forward because these private companies do have an incredible amount  of control over the internet.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  And that's the point, controlling who has a voice and who  doesn't on these monster platforms is tantamount to limiting speech.  And  as you'll see in a moment, it's also viewpoint discrimination.  Back in  February, Facebook launched a new algorithm that would cause top  conservative pages to see a dramatic drop in traffic.  And this included  personal pages, by the way.  President Trump's Facebook page saw a 45  percent drop.  Diamond and Silk said their content was similarly blocked on  Facebook.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Facebook, along with other social media sites have  taken aggressive actions to silence conservative voices such as ourselves  by deliberately restricting and weaponizing our page with algorithms that  censor and repress our free speech.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Next it was YouTube, who let conservative influencers build up  an audience for years, only to end up limiting their channel temporarily,  demonetizing them with no warning at all.  This has happened to  conservative commentators like Ben Shapiro, Dave Ruben and Dennis Prager.   </p><p>For many on the left, the view seems to become if you can't beat them,  prevent them from speaking.  Just look at what's happened on the  conservative speakers on college campuses.  And after liberal radio hosts  flopped on Air America -- remember them -- well, some democrats thought to  revive the fairness doctrine to snuff out conservative talk radio.   Thankfully that went nowhere.  But now they've moved onto the internet and  squelching political speech there.  </p><p>A leaked proposal circulating amongst democrats outlines a detailed plan to  take over the internet by regulating digital platforms and purging content  they deem harmful or inaccurate.  In other words, information they don't  like.  They would require social media users to be tracked and labeled  according to how reasonable their content is deemed to be.  Democrat  Senator Chris Murphy even hinted at this yesterday, tweeting, Infowars is a  tip of a giant iceberg of hates and lies, that uses sites like Facebook and  YouTube to tear our nation apart.  These companies must do more than take  down one website.  The survival or our democracy depends on it.  </p><p>How dramatic.  Translation: the survival of the democratic party depends on  it.  There's an old saying in TV and radio that content is king.  Same goes  for the internet.  If they can shut down political speech on the grounds  that it's hateful, you have to ask where does this end?  If you want to see  hate, check out some of the comments on my Twitter feed after the show  tonight.  Then you'll see hateful.</p><p>Why do leftists always seem to escape big techs censors?  I don't know  Louis Farrakhan comes to mind.  He's a casual racist, of course, and an  anti-Semite who called white people \"potential humans,\" praised Hitler and  blamed Jews for 9/11.  </p><p>Well he's still standing tall on his Facebook page -- has a million  followers.  And what about those who traffic in violence?  If Facebook  really cares about standards or safety, I don't think they would be  granting ANTIFA chapters from coast to coast where their pages can plug  their next thuggish beat down of conservatives with their black hoods and  all.  And by the way, if there's so much concern over conspiracy theories  like the one Alex Jones peddles, well, do moments like this give social  media kings pause?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP</p><p>ROSIE O'DONNELL, TV PERSONALITY:  The fact of the matter is, he's not only  bad because he's a liar, he's bad because he doesn't know how to inspire  people or invoke that emotion in them.  </p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST:  What about his rallies?  </p><p>O'DONNELL:  First of all, people are paid, Chris.  You know that.  People  were paid since he went down on the escalator.  He pays people to show up  at those rallies.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Trump pays people to go to his rallies.  That would be a lot of  money.  She still has a YouTube channel.  The truth is we conservatives  always want more political speech, not less of it, even when it's offensive  to us.  Our only point usually about speech is limiting it if there's a  direct incitement to violence, or material that is injurious to children.   But political speech in general, we want more.  </p><p>Now, while Facebook and apple are private companies and thus aren't actors  for first amendment companies, they be really careful with these moves to  circumscribe certain groups political speech, because voters in the future  might just demand that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube be treated more like  public utility, public utilities that have to operate in the public  interest.  But since a utility can't refuse to give electricity to a family  because they disagree with their views or heaven forbid because they're of  a different race, they act in the public interest.  Ted Cruz, by the way,  in response to the Alex Jones purge said tech companies have quote a degree  of power and an ability to censor that William Randolph Hearst at the  height of Yellow Journalism could never have imagined.  They have the  ability if there is a speaker that is disfavored simply to silence the  speaker.  Your words float off into oblivion and nobody hears them.  </p><p>Well, he's right about their power.  The big five tech companies are now  worth an estimated $4 trillion.  Well, that figure puts them above the GDP  of all but seven countries on the planet.  The immense size of these  companies is concerning, but so too is the speed with which they can  succumb to external pressure.  Point in case, just three weeks ago, Mark  Zuckerberg defended keeping Infowars on his platform.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  If you look at the things that are getting the most  distribution, people flag them as potential hoaxes, we send those to fact  checkers and if those fact checkers say that it is provably false, then we  will significantly reduce the distribution of that content.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Why don't you want to just say, \"get off our  platform\"?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  As abhorrent as some of this content can be, it gets down to  this principle of giving people a voice.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  So why did he end up caving here?  We'll continue to demand  answers for you.  Remember when disgraced FBI agent Strzok texted Lisa Page  about an insurance policy to keep Trump from getting elected?  Remember  that?  Well maybe, just maybe these latest moves are the beginning of big  tech's own version of an insurance policy to see that someone with Trump's  views never reaches a position of authority in government again.  And  that's the angle.  </p><p>Joining us now with a reaction, Monica Crowley from the London Center for  Policy Research, Attorney Dan Gilleon and Elizabeth Heng, a Republican  Congressional candidate from California who had one of her campaign ads  temporarily blocked on Facebook.  It's great to see all of you.  Elizabeth,  let's start with you because I watched your campaign ad.  </p><p>And you had some images from your -- your parents' country of birth,  Cambodia and, you know, the brutality of Cambodia, the Cambodian purge.   And Facebook, you know, blocked it.  They said what to you when you brought  this up?  This is some of the images from the ad.  What did they say to you  when you brought this up ?  </p><p>ELIZABETH HENG (R), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, CALIFORNIA:  They said that my  -- the ad was shocking, disrespectful, and too sensational to be on  Facebook.  And that is -- that was absolutely maddening in so many ways for  me.  You know, my -- when I decided to run for Congress, I got into the  race because I -- and part of my message was that great things can come  from great adversity.  </p><p>My parents lived through the genocide in -- in Cambodia and came to the  United States as refugees.  And so for some reason, Facebook found that  offensive and removed my ability to advertise the campaign message.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Dan, this is kind of problematic.  I mean, I think for (ph)  civil libertarians -- this is more (ph) Democrats, ACLUs and (ph) amazingly  quiet on this.  And they have a statement on their website, but I don't  don't see them on any television shows.  They're too busy representing  illegal immigrants.  But Dan, where are the libertarians on this issue?  I  mean those are historical photos.  </p><p>I mean, the holocaust.  Are we not able to talk about that and the horrors  that were perpetrated on Jews on these social media platforms?  What's  going on here?  </p><p>DAN GILLEON, ATTORNEY:  Laura -- I -- I think you need to back up a little  bit.  And I want to restate something that you said earlier, which is  really important, that none of these companies you're talking about,  they're not state actors.  They're not the government.  And so this whole  First Amendment thing you've been talking about all along, it's out the  window.  </p><p>So what you're talking about here are decisions by companies on their  content, something that Fox News does, something that every single media  outlet does.  And I think for you to go and say, listen, this is all about  because we're Republicans, we're conservatives -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Where -- where's the -- where's the discrimination or the  similar actions against a myriad of leftists.  You saw the examples -- </p><p>GILLEON:  Let -- let me -- let me give you an example.  Let me give you an  example.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, now why isn't Antifa blocked from Facebook?  Why are they  still on YouTube?  </p><p>GILLEON:  Well maybe they should be, OK?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Laura.  Laura, listen, though.  But you just asked me a  question.  Let me answer it.  You know, back -- back in 2015, being liberal  was knocked right off of Facebook.  Right?  I -- I have a lot more -- I can  assure you, I have a lot more liberal friends on my Facebook feed than a  lot of your viewers do and I see them griping time and time again, every  night about Facebook acting against them too and knocking them off for  stupid things they say.  </p><p>Facebook has made a decision and it seems like it's not that hard to  understand, giving -- given the history and the $16 billion that Mr.  Zuckerberg took a hit on, that he's made a decision that his company is  going to start making different decisions on content they did before.  </p><p>But you know Infowars, it's still out there on Instagram.  It's still  there.  And Instagram, you know, is huge.  Twitter is out there -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  So -- so -- so Dan, you see no difference -- you see no  difference between a cable channel -- there's how many cable channels out  there?  I don't even know.  I mean, I don't watch most cable channels but  there are a lot.  From a cable channel and YouTube or Facebook or the  entire Apple platform worth a trillion dollars?  You see no difference as  far as their control of information?  Really?  What's the equivalent of  YouTube?  </p><p>GILLEON:  I'm not really sure where you're going.  They're non-state actors  -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Name a -- it's about controlling information.  What is the  equivalent of YouTube -- </p><p>GILLEON:  Well, Instagram -- Instagram -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  YouTube.  </p><p>GILLEON:  I don't know.  I mean you're -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  There isn't one is the point.  </p><p>GILLEON:  Instagram?  Instagram?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>GILLEON:  -- but they're all companies -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  -- no, no, no, no, no.  You don't know social media.  </p><p>GILLEON:  Laura -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  It does not compete -- YouTube and Instagram do not compete with  each other.  </p><p>GILLEON:  OK.  Well thank you for that information.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I got to go to Monica.  Monica, you see my point.  Of course  they're not state actors.  My point is when you have an overwhelmingly left  wing directorate, employees -- 100 percent of all Twitter employees for  instance in 2014 contributed to Democratic causes, that's not a, you know,  conservative website piece.  That's a factual determination, Twitter  admitted it.</p><p>CROWLEY:  Yes.  And it .</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Doesn't have any effect?  OK, I guess.</p><p>CROWLEY:  . I mean, come on.  Common sense points to -- to the truth about  this.  Look, the -- these Internet companies, they're giants, they're  behemoths.  They are incredibly influential and dominant.  And that's the  point.</p><p>To your point about Twitter, the guy who used to run tech for Twitter is  now running tech for the Democratic National Committee, just in time for  the midterm elections.  That's just one example.  We're not talking about  particular content, about Infowars et cetera.</p><p>What we are talking about is that a few select companies that have near  monopolies in the digital sphere are now having control over the  information that is available to you.  And it's only going to get worse.   So we are now on this slippery slope, Laura, where they're controlling the  Infowars website and so on.</p><p>But go a couple of years down the road or maybe even a shorter time period,  and they -- those leftist overlords in the digital sphere will be able to  deem anything that they consider unacceptable, and that's a subjective  standard, inappropriate for -- for consumption, whether that's statements  about Islamic fundamentalism, maybe it's .</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Abortion.</p><p>CROWLEY:  . to say -- abortion, maybe it's statements about .</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Pro-life.</p><p>CROWLEY:  . right -- pro-life or support -- support for the police.  They  will be able to use this sliding scale, based on what they think is  appropriate rather than the First Amendment standard.  And that is a very  dark and dangerous place for this country to be.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Elizabeth, in -- Mark Zuckerberg was questioned about this by  Ted Cruz back in April.  And he -- he said, look, we're -- there's no bias.   But we're going to have standards in place.  Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS:  To a great many Americans, that appears to be a  pervasive pattern of political bias.  Do you agree with that assessment?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I understand where that concern is coming  from because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley  which is an extremely left-leaning place.  And I -- this is actually a  concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company is making  sure that we don't have any bias in the work that we do.  And I think it is  a fair concern that -- that people would -- would .</p><p>CRUZ:  So -- so let me -- let me .</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  . at least wonder about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, that was a moment of candor from Zuckerberg.  I mean,  anyone who's spent any time in Silicon Valley, it's a -- it's a political  monolith.  I know there are conservatives there, but they probably hide  their views.  I don't know why, but they don't want to -- they don't want  to .</p><p>HENG:  Yes .</p><p>INGRAHAM:  . literally do not want to say they're conservative when they  work there or they'll -- they probably will lose their job.  I mean, I've  heard those comments, not -- not at Facebook but other high-tech companies.   Elizabeth.</p><p>HENG:  Yes, Laura.  It's undeniable that Facebook has algorithms that lean  towards and incentivize those that have more liberal tendencies.  And their  algorithms will promote those such as Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and my  opponent Jim Costa.</p><p>And it -- this just goes to show, why did it take five days and the whole  national movement for Facebook to respond to my -- my -- my ad here?  This  is my story.  This is -- this is -- the story in which I told that they,  I'm assuming had concerns with in the beginning of it, where it -- it shoed  glimpses of genocide.  Those weren't just photos, but my family has (ph) to  (inaudible) .</p><p>INGRAHAM:  So, Elizabeth, do you think -- do you think you're being  targeted?</p><p>HENG:  . through this.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Elizabeth, do you think you're being targeted as an Asian  conservative candidate in liberal California because you represent a  dangerous possibility for the left, is that what you're saying?</p><p>HENG:  Yes.  We constantly see this time and time again with conservatives.   That from these tech -- these tech giants that the algorithms that are in  place do -- do not support conservative ideologies.  It is so -- and this  important part about all of this is that it is so incredibly important for  platforms, such as Facebook who claim to be sort of the -- the online  community space, to have diverse political thoughts on there.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  That's (ph) better, yes.</p><p>HENG:  Time and time again we see that is not the case .</p><p>GILLEON:  Laura .</p><p>INGRAHAM:  More speech .</p><p>GILLEON:  . Laura, can I .</p><p>INGRAHAM:   is better for everybody.  Dan, go ahead.</p><p>GILLEON:  Yes.  There was an Ipsos poll today, 43 percent of Americans  support Trump's idea of -- of shutting down media outlets that don't  behave.  So this is -- this is -- goes both ways.  And this is not a  Republican versus a Democrat issue.  I mean, I -- I -- you mentioned the  ACLU.  I know the ACLU really does not like any sort of infringement on  anything -</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, where are they?</p><p>GILLEON:  - speech related.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p>GILLEON:  Well, I can assure -</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Where are they?  We got to get Monica.  They're nowhere.   They're nowhere.  They're focusing on illegal immigration and partisan  issues.</p><p>GILLEON:  Well -</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Monica, really quick.  We got thirty seconds.</p><p>CROWLEY:  Yes, I mean, I really feel for Elizabeth because she's trying to  tell the story of her family, which is the American dream, and, you know,  these tech giants are trying to crush that message which is particularly  appalling.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p>CROWLEY:  But as Elizabeth points out, they've got these algorithms.   They're clearly set in a certain direction, but then they'll say, \"well,  then we've got a next barrier of humans, actual human beings who are trying  to review these into artificial intelligence decisions and make sure -</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, yes.</p><p>CROWLEY:  - there's no bias because all of those people are on the left.\"</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right.  Now, they're on the left, and by the way, Jack  Dorsey of Twitter today, late tonight says that Alex Jones didn't violate  their policy, so Twitter so far seems to be the best of all.</p><p>Up next, President Trump made a campaign stop for him in Ohio.  Can he pull  off a win?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>President Trump tonight facing a political test of his influence in a House  special election in Ohio, and this race is neck and neck at the moment.   Fox News Correspondent Kristin Fisher joins us live from the election  headquarters, a republican Troy Balderson who's fighting Democrat Danny  O'Connor for that Ohio House seat.    Kristin, what is the latest there?</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well Laura, everyone is on the  edge of their seat here at Balderson's headquarters because this race is  shaping up to be exactly how the polls predicted.  It is razor tight, and  right literally everybody in the room has their eye on one country.  There  is only one country that does not have all of its precincts in, and that is  Delaware County.</p><p>And this is a big deal because Delaware County is the country that  President Trump came to on Saturday.  It is where he held his big rally for  Republican Troy Balderson.  This is also a county that has been reliably  Republican over the years, and yet when the early vote came in, Danny  O'Connor, the Democrat, won the early vote by about 2,000 votes.</p><p>So that has everybody here very nervous.  They're watching Delaware County  very closely.  And based on the unofficial results I'm looking at right now  on the Ohio secretary of state website, we have 95 percent of the  (inaudible) in Delaware County and -- and Balderson is ahead 54-45 (ph).   So we'll see if that holds.  The other county that we've been watching all  night, Franklin County.  </p><p>That's the county just outside the -- the suburbs of Columbus.  This is  where the Democrat, Danny O'Connor is from.  It's also what the Republican,  Troy Balderson had alluded to last night at his rally.  He made a little  bit of a (inaudible) he said, you don't want to see someone from Franklin  County representing us (ph) (inaudible) Democrat Danny O'Connor of course  is from Franklin County.  </p><p>And now O'Connor is ahead there, 65-35.  not a huge surprise there, but  this is so close, Laura.  The other thing I'm hearing a lot from people in  the room, the possibility of an automatic recount.  If the difference is  0.5 percent or less, that triggers an automatic recount.  It is very close.   But so far right now, still outside that automatic recount margin, Laura.  </p><p>It is very exciting in here but everybody's still very nervous and  cautiously optimistic.  That's crazy (ph).  I keep hearing over and over  (inaudible) -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Kristen, certainly loud there.  Great reporting.  We'll continue  to monitor this race and others throughout the hour and the night and bring  you the results as they come in.  Very exciting.  Of course even if  Balderson wins, the other networks will say it's really a loss for Trump.   So even if he wins, he loses.  So just make sure you get that right.  </p><p>Well, as we touched on earlier in the angle, one of your favorites -- and I  know you've missed her on daily television -- Rosie O'Donnell has gone into  full conspiracy theory mode with regard to President Trump.  And last night  -- about how many blocks is it?  16, 17 blocks from here?  O'Donnell led a  sing along protest -- I kid you not -- in front of the White House with  some of her fellow Hollywood and Broadway stars.  Even though no one told  them the president wasn't home.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>ROSIE O'DONNELL, COMEDIAN:  We are so thrilled to finally be here at the  Kremlin annex on night 22.  How many have been here every night?  Let's  hear it.  And we're going to keep coming back until he's out.  Let the  president know in no uncertain terms that we are alive, awake and we are  woke.  We are not going away.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Raise your hand if you're sick of woke.  I am.  Former Arkansas  governor Mike Huckabee joins us with a reaction.  Governor, first of all,  on my radio show, I played all the really bad singing.  I mean, these are  great Broadway stars, a lot of talent.  But I don't know.  The -- the  chanting, no rhyming.  They haven't updated the chant since like 1968 on  the left.  So it was very disappointing.  </p><p>But what do you make of her resurgence on the scene?  And the -- tonight,  they were -- I went by the White House tonight.  These -- these people are  still out there.  I guess until they feel like they can drive the president  from office.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER GOVERNOR, ARKANSAS:  Well, I think it's important  that you know that he wasn't even there.  I think they thought it was  Halloween and they were there to do some early trick or treating and they  scared the daylights out of people around the White House.  The other thing  that I believe that may perhaps solve this mystery.  Where did that noise  come from that damaged the ear -- the hearing of the people who were  working for the state department down in the Cuban embassy.  </p><p>I think we now know.  Rosie and her team had gone down there and that's  what caused that physical damage.  One other observation, Laura.  I thought  Rosie had moved to Canada.  You know, she promised that if Trump got  elected she would go.  So I don't know what she was able to do.  I guess  she was coming back into the country for a brief visit.  Because after all,  she's Canadian now, isn't she?  Did I miss something?  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well she -- she's a woman on a mission.  I mean, she actually  said to Chris Cuomo last night that Donald Trump and his organization pays  people to attend his rallies.  And Chris Cuomo is just like what?  Pay?   Well maybe -- he said, like, maybe some but he has tens of thousands of  people.  And then she said no he doesn't.  What -- I mean, I guess she  didn't remember the Mobile, Alabama rally in 2015 (ph) in August where he  had 70,000 people.  </p><p>I guess those were all cardboard cutouts in Rosie land.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well those cardboard cutouts are sure making a lot of noise.   And I'll tell you another thing.  It's absurd to say that those people are  paid.  Those people just happen to love their country.  Now let me be fair.   Rosie O'Donnell has as much right to protest and sing songs as anybody  else.  This is America.  We're all fine with that.  </p><p>But I think what we all find a little bit disingenuous is that her attitude  is rather than accept the election results from 2016, suck it up and say  we're going to do better next time, their idea is let's invalidate the  election results because we don't like how they turned out.  This is the  rantings of a seven-year-old who got defeated playing baseball and decided  that we're just going to overturn the game rather than just learn how to  play the game a little better next time.  </p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Governor, not just that but now the  entertainment industry on the left coast and the west Hollywood crowd has  voted, I'm sure the president is devastated, to remove the president's star  on the Hollywood walk of fame.  So no longer will they have to guard the  star.  People won't pickax.  This is what it's come to.  This is how petty  and pathetic they have become.  They're going after some -- what is that,  marble.  I don't know what it is.  But that I guess makes them feel better  and they feel like they've had a good -- that's their idea of victory.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, if they're going to chop up everybody's star who has done  something they don't like, they might as well rent a bunch of jackhammers  because there's a lot of people on that sidewalk who represent some pretty  crazy views and some things that have gotten them landed with the Me Too  movement.  So will we see a goodbye from Kevin Spacey, from Roman Polanski?   How many of the Hollywood elites are going to have their stars chopped up  because they didn't exactly do the right thing, to be charitable about it?  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  No.  It's such a double standard.  We have the -- if you're a  star like James Gunn and director of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and you had  bad tweets, they make an excuse for you.  But if you're anyone who is a  conservative, you apologize for something or make a mistake, they never  forgive you.  The forgiveness only ever goes one way.  Governor, thank you  so much.  </p><p>And by the way, the showdown between the Trump legal team and Bob Mueller  over that presidential interview is about to take a dramatic turn.   Details, reaction, Alan Dershowitz and Wisenberg next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  A dramatic new turn may be imminent in the showdown between the  Trump legal team and special prosecutor Bob Mueller.  According to FOX News  sources, Trump attorneys are preparing to send the special counsel a letter  largely turning down any questions related to obstruction of justice during  a potential presidential interview.  But Rudy Giuliani gave an interview  just posted on \"Politico\" where he leaves the door open to some limited  questioning about obstruction, which is an interesting new development.  </p><p>Will this spark, though, a major escalation between both sides in the  Russia probe?  Joining us now to analyze, Alan Dershowitz, author of the  big bestseller, \"The Case against Impeaching Trump,\" and Sol Wisenberg,  former deputy independent council in the Whitewater investigation.  We'll  also get into the cantankerous T.S. Ellis, the federal district judge who  is presiding over the Paul Manafort trial.</p><p>But let's get to this breaking news, Rudy Giuliani and this \"Politico\"  interview.  You probably haven't read it, either of you, but he seems to  leave open the possibility of a very narrow set of questions, if it can be  narrowed, on obstruction.  Alan, I'll go to you first.  What might be the  wisdom in that?  </p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS:  I think Giuliani's tactic  is to be able to say to the public, look, our president was willing to  speak and Mueller turned him down.  I think he's Mueller an offer that  Mueller can't really accept.  He's putting forth a kind of narrow window.   If Mueller accepts it, then game on and we'll see some narrow questioning.  </p><p>But if I were Trump's lawyer -- I'm not -- I would not under any  circumstances allow him to testify, because all you need is one question in  which he answers truthfully, but somebody else answers in a different way,  say he says, I didn't know about the meeting at the Trump Tower involving  the Russians, and Cohen says, yes, he did, then you have an opportunity to  spring that perjury trap.  So in the end, I don't think lawyers generally  will advise a client to testify or sit down with a prosecutor.  But I think  this client wants to be able to say I offered to sit down and it was  Mueller who turned me down.  So I think that's the strategy.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Here's some of the previous conditions, Sol, placed on any  potential interview that Giuliani had set out.  And we'll put it up on the  screen for our viewers.  It can only be two to three hours long, narrow set  of questions on collusion.  They provide info on FBI information first, so  they want that information, show proof that Trump committed a crime, show  testimony is needed to end a probe, and curtail obstruction questions.  So  that's the one that kind of was fleshed out a little bit more tonight in  Giuliani's comments to \"Politico,\" that last bullet point.  Sol, you're  reaction to these latest developments?  Do you agree with what Professor  Dershowitz is positing there?  </p><p>SOLOMON WISENBERG, PARTNER, NELSON-MULLINS:  No prosecutor worth his salt  is going to accept those kinds of preconditions.  But there's a reason --  and I do agree with, and have long agreed with Professor Dershowitz's  assertion that the president shouldn't go in and answer these questions.   It's far too dangerous.  But there's a reason Bob Mueller has put up with  this dance for so long.  And I think a lot of people don't understand it.  </p><p>If he issues the subpoena to force President Trump to be interviewed by  him, to go to the grand jury, for example, certainly President Trump has to  accept that subpoena.  You can subpoena a president.  But then when  President Trump invokes executive privilege, under the law, the current law  in the D.C. circuit in resealed case, it is going to be very difficult and  time-consuming for Bob Mueller to ask the questions he wants to ask,  particularly about obstructions.  And there is absolutely no guarantee that  he will win.  </p><p>You're talking about the heart of executive privilege here, presidential  communications and presidential thought processes.  And Mueller would have  to show that it's very, very important evidence and that he can't get it  anywhere else.  </p><p>And don't forget, when Jaworski won the tapes case against Nixon, and when  Cox won the earlier case, they knew their subpoenas were incredibly  narrowly drawn.  They knew the tapes existed.  They knew there were  potentially incriminatory conversations on those tapes.  Mueller does not  have that.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Very different.</p><p>WISENBERG:  And more than anything else, Mueller does not have the right to  even litigate executive privilege.  The first thing President Trump is  going to say is, I'm your boss.  You can't even be in court.  So the reason  why Mueller has put up with these ridiculous preconditions is that he  probably can't win if he goes to court.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And Alan, they have already gamed this out.  You have Emmet  Flood, one of the top partners at Williams and Connolly who's running this  side of the legal prep inside the White House.  He clerked for Justice  Scalia.  He was my co-clerk on the Secord Circuit for Ralph Winter.   Brilliant guy.  They've already gamed this out, correct?  This is probably  already briefed.  </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Yes, they had gamed it out a long time ago.  Remember, that  was the firm that represented Bill Clinton in his efforts to try to prevent  testimony.  </p><p>In addition to his claim of executive privilege, there's also  constitutional argument, and that is that since a senator and a congressman  can't be questioned about what they did on the floor of the Senate, I don't  believe a president can be questioned about why he pardoned or why he fired  or why he tweeted or why he exercised any of his powers under Article Two  of the Constitution or the First Amendment.  </p><p>So although I think in the end if a subpoena was issued and challenged, I  think Mueller would be able to get some testimony from the president if he  stayed away from issues that are covered by these privileges.  But in the  end it would be a Pyrrhic victory.  It would take him so much time that it  would guarantee that the report could not be written until after the  midterm election.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Wow, we don't even have time to get to T.S. Ellis and how he was  a little cantankerous.  But when we have you back -- I mean, this is going  to be going on for at least another week or so.  </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  He's a tough judge.  He's a tough judge to both guys.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I love when he says, you've got to look at me when I talk to  you.  That's what I say to my kids.  And then the lawyer's like, I'm  looking at you.  </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  He tells the truth. </p><p>WISENBERG:  He does this with everybody.  He does this with everybody.  But  it doesn't make it right.  He needs to really hold back and let the  litigators try their case.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right, guys.  </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  But he did the right thing when he talked about Manafort and  why they're going after him.  He told the truth about that, a truth too few  people are willing to recognize.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I think he went a little far --  </p><p>WISENBERG:  Yes, but he doesn't need to be doing that in front of the jury,  though.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  But when he's saying, you have tears in your eyes --  </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  That was not in front of the jury.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  He says, no, I don't.  I'm sorry, but it is very dramatic.  But  it might be a little too much.  All right, guys, thanks so much.  </p><p>That Ohio 12th race is still too close to call, by the way, but Republican  Troy Balderson has a slight lead.  We'll bring you updates when the race is  called, and perhaps in a matter of moments.  But next, an Iraqi immigrant  who was set to be deported is now accused of putting a police officer in  critical condition.  The tragic story next.     </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Our country's immigration laws lead to tragic consequences yet  again.  A Colorado police officer is in critical but stable condition  following a gun battle last week with Karrar Noaman Al Khammasi, an Iraqi  refugee.  Khammasi was in federal custody awaiting deportation in 2016  after he violated probation terms from a previous trespassing plea.  But  his removal was halted after a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision  invalidated the government's grounds for doing so.</p><p>Joining me to discuss all this is Dan Kovalik, who is an international  rights lawyer and a professor and the author of the book \"The Plot to  Scapegoat Russia,\" and Tom Homan is a former acting director of ICE live  from the studio with me tonight.  Tom, this guy was quite a beaut.  He was  arrested on a weapons charge, possession, a previous offender, that was in  January of this year, and then leads to this horrific shooting of this  police officer.  </p><p>THOMAS HOMAN, FORMER ACTING ICE DIRECTOR:  I think it's clear that somebody  shouldn't have been allowed to stay in the country.  It's a great privilege  to be allowed to come to this country as a refugee or a non-immigrant.  And  to anybody in this country that's given such a great privilege, that's  somebody that needs to leave.  They need to remove that privilege and be  removed from the United States and send them home.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  The 10th circuit initially said in their ruling that the  government didn't have a right, I think it was the description of what a  violent offense is, too ambiguous of a term.  So said no, that's not going  to work.  So once again, the courts end up making the job of enforcing  commonsense immigration law much more difficult.  </p><p>HOMAN:  Well, I disagree with the court's decision.  But as a law  enforcement officer, career law enforcement officer, they ran a law  enforcement agency, we have to salute and follow the court's order.   However, now it's up to Congress.  If they're saying the definition of  crime and violence is too vague, it's up to Congress to fix it and make it  not vague, because people that come to this country and commit crimes, they  need to go home.  We need to protect the sovereignty of this country and we  need to protect public safety.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Dan, President Trump wants to reduce the number of refugees in  the United States.  Currently about 40,000, Hillary wanted about 100,000.   He wants to bring it down to about 15,000 because difficulty vetting.   We're going to do extreme vetting but we don't know how well that's working  out.  What's your reaction to this particular story and then the broader  issue?  </p><p>DANIEL KOVALIK, INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY:  Well, first of all,  my response is that you can never extrapolate from one example.  There was  a very good story in the \"Washington Post\" in June by a guy named  Christopher Ingraham showing that in fact both illegal immigrants and legal  immigrants commit much less crimes in fact than natural-born Americans,  which needs to be kept in mind.  But I also want to note if we want to look  at the big picture issues, things we can extrapolate from.  These wars the  U.S. has been fighting, like in Iraq, have actually exacerbated the  immigration issue.  And if people want to deal with lower immigration, the  U.S. ought to start to think about withdrawing from these wars and avoiding  --  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, we're not here to debate the wars.  I would probably agree  with you on a lot of the wars issue.  We're talking about our right, our  sovereign right as a people to decide who gets to come in, and then when  you're here as basically a privilege that we grant you, who doesn't get to  stay.  And we have violent criminals who are released onto the streets,  people who are here illegally, and, Tom, as you know, who have been  deported multiple times, who come back, commit heinous crimes or DWI.  They  have a trail of tears behind them.  And we still have the ACLU out there  beating the drums for more illegal immigrants in the United States.  And I  think this has got to stop.  </p><p>KOVALIK:  Statistically, immigrants commit less crimes.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I don't care.  That is such a meaningless statistic.  They're  not supposed to be here.  </p><p>KOVALIK:  No, it's a very important statistic.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  They're not supposed to be here. </p><p>KOVALIK:  He was a legal immigrant.  He was legal.</p><p>HOMAN:  Let me respond to the meaningless quote that he just made that  illegal aliens and aliens here illegally commit less crimes than U.S.  citizens.  That's not the issue.  The issue is how many crimes could have  been prevented if they weren't here.  So for people to say they commit less  crimes.  The question is how many crimes could have been prevented if we  have secure borders and immigration law that made sense.  That's the  question.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And the John Lott study in Arizona which was the most definitive  of any jurisdiction that's ever been done, Professor John Lott, showed that  illegal aliens are 142 percent more likely to be arrested for a crime.   It's specific police data culled through.  It was painstakingly specific  and well documented.  So that's another fact.</p><p>By the way, I want to put it as one full screen.  We're running long.   Issues that are important to the American voters, America's top problem  facing the U.S., immigration, number one at 22 percent of the public.   Government, poor leadership, 19 percent, race relations down at seven  percent.  Healthcare is down at three percent.  Immigration, Dan, the  number-one issue for Americans.  And I don't think it's because Americans  want more illegal immigration in the United States.  You can close it out  real quick.  </p><p>KOVALIK:  I think immigrants are being scapegoated for a lot of problems  that are not theirs, and I don't like people being scapegoated.  I don't  like the Russians being scapegoated, and I think this is a country of  immigrants.  My grandfather was here from --  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Legal immigrants.  Legal.  </p><p>KOVALIK:  Yes, but I don't think there's any such thing as an illegal  immigrant.  But in any case --</p><p>INGRAHAM:  That's very revealing.  Borders don't matter, countries don't  matter.  Let's do I tall, John Lennon song.  There's no wars, there's no  borders, there's no countries, there's no sovereignty, and then ultimately  they'll be no freedom.  Love the segment.  Thank you both.  </p><p>By the way, police bust a man threatening the life of House Majority Whip  Steve Scalise barely a year after he was nearly killed by a gunman.   Congressman Scalise joins us exclusively with his reaction next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise facing new threats to his life  barely more than a year after he was nearly assassinated during that  Congressional softball team practice.  Police have arrested 63-year-old  Carlos Bayon of Grand Island, New York, charging him with menacing the  Congressman after leaving violent voicemail messages.  Authorities  discovered hundreds of rounds of ammo and firearm purchase receipts in  Dayon's home along with bomb-building information.  </p><p>Joining us exclusively now with his reaction is House Majority Whip Steve  Scalise.  Congressman, it's great to see you.  I'm so relieved this guy was  found, this was prevented.  Lord knows what might have happened.  We're  also awaiting the election results from Ohio 12, which we're going to talk  to you about, Congressman Scalise.  But your reaction to yet another  violent threat against your life.  </p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE, (R-LA) HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  Well, Laura, it's great to  be back with you.  And clearly, these kinds of disturbing things, there's  no place for it in politics.  I first want to thank, once again, our United  States capitol police.  They were very quick to act when my office received  this threat.  They sent the information on to Capitol police.  Capitol  police did research, found out that this man has had some real serious  concerns.  And it was hard to track him down because he was trying to use  aliases.  But ultimately they found him.  And he's in custody, in federal  custody.  And hopefully he gets a serious sentence, because you can't allow  this kind of threats and violence against peoples based on their political  views.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Congressman, did he have postings on social media about you?   Was it a purely political ax to grind?  Is he mentally deranged or a  combination of both?  </p><p>SCALISE:  I guess we'll find out a lot of that.  Clearly he had some strong  disagreements with my political views and others.  There were others that  he threatened as well.  And he's going to have to account to that.  The  Justice Department has him now.  But again, my thanks and true appreciation  goes out to our law enforcement, the United States Capitol police acted  quickly and working with New York authority to make sure that he got into  custody.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Does what you see with Antifa across the country, taking over  this Portland ICE office, black hoods, the beatdowns of conservatives,  intimidations of conservatives in public.  You saw what happened to Charlie  Kirk and his colleague Candace Owens the other morning in Philadelphia.   This seems to be ratcheting up.  The left blames President Trump.  They  say, well, he's calling the news fake news and calling them out and that's  making people more and more anxious.  </p><p>SCALISE:  No.  You look at some of the liberal rhetoric that's coming out  from the left.  They're encouraging and inciting, in many cases, violence.   And it's got to stop.  In fact, liberals need to call this out.  They need  to speak up, just as we're speaking up saying there's no place for it on  the Republican or Democrat siding.  I think people on the left need to be  as vocal about calling out this kind of violence.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  We were talking about Facebook and Apple moving against more  conservative voice beyond Alex Jones but to other conservatives who have  seen their voices diminished on these mega-platforms, trillions of dollars  of market cap in these companies.  Are you concerned that groups like  Antifa, which have incited violence at these rallies, they have -- I mean,  they continue on YouTube and so forth and Facebook seemingly with impunity,  other groups like them.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Yes, it's clearly a double standard.  We've pointed some of this  out.  In fact, when Mark Zuckerberg testified before the Energy and  Commerce Committee that I sit on just a few weeks ago, I brought this up,  the bias that we're seeing on Facebook since they put a new algorithm in  place to change the way that people get their newsfeeds, and where they're  literally starting to filter in, from what we've seen, a left-leaning way  and having a bias against conservatives.  We've raised it to them, and they  have gotten back to me to let me know that this is something they're  looking into.  But we need to watch it closely, because if they get into a  position where it looks like they're trying to become the platform of the  left, there are other social media sites people can go to and will go to if  it becomes a liberal site.  They don't want their site to become a liberal  --</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, a monopoly.  We don't want them to have monopoly power.</p><p>We're almost out of time.  You predict this Ohio 12 is going to go  Republican, Congressman, yes or no?  </p><p>SCALISE:  I do.  And the numbers that are coming in our strong.  President  Trump going in, Laura, I think really helped swing this race to the  Republican side.  It was neck and neck all the way.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Congressman Scalise, thank you so much.  We'll have results.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Before we go, let's take a quick look at the latest results in  that special election for Ohio's 12th Congressional district, still neck in  next with Republican Troy Balderson with a razor thin lead over Democrat  Danny O'Connor.  Balderson is expected to speak to supporters at any  moment.  </p><p>And lucky, Shannon Bream and the \"FOX News at Night\" team are up next.   They're going to have it all covered and the live event, the live presser  then.  Shannon, it doesn't get more exciting than this.  It's like less  than one point.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I'm Laura Ingraham and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. We have a jam-packed show for you tonight. Busy primary tonight across the country. And we'll give you some hints about what November might look like. This includes an extremely razor thin margin in Ohio's 12th district.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former governor Mike Huckabee is also here to react to a loony left wing -- Rosie O'Donnell's latest stunt in front of the White House. You could almost hear it last night from our set. Plus the president's legal team expected to respond to Robert Mueller's demands as early as tomorrow. So that's news. Dershowitz is here to tell us what should and should not be included. And Representative Steve Scalise joins us exclusively on the increasing hostile that republicans face these days, including a death threat that he just received.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, big tech and the new corporate censorship. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Remember what Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told the Senate hearing back in April?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: There's certain content that clearly, we do not allow. Hate speech, terrorist content, nudity, anything that makes people feel unsafe in the community. From that perspective, that's what we generally try to refer to what we do as a platform for all ideas.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: A platform for all ideas. Really? Over the past few months, Facebook and other tech giants have given us ample reasons to doubt that proclamation. The latest example started early yesterday morning when Apple pulled several podcasts associated with the controversial and incendiary Alex Jones. Facebook followed suite, unpublishing four of Jones' pages, claiming that the videos on those pages violated that hate speech policy. Hours later YouTube decided it wasn't going to miss out on all that censorship fun and YouTube suspended the Alex Jones channel with its 2.4 million subscribers.</p><p>Well it's easy to dismiss concerns about big techs actions all coordinated it seems to shut down Jones, because of course, he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories. But this isn't about Alex Jones. This is about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as individuals trust and like. If big tech can control the information flow, then they can also perhaps even influence the outcome of the midterms and even future presidential elections.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Essentially, Alex Jones has been deleted, digitally deplatformed from these websites, you wonder if he'll have any influence going forward because these private companies do have an incredible amount of control over the internet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: And that's the point, controlling who has a voice and who doesn't on these monster platforms is tantamount to limiting speech. And as you'll see in a moment, it's also viewpoint discrimination. Back in February, Facebook launched a new algorithm that would cause top conservative pages to see a dramatic drop in traffic. And this included personal pages, by the way. President Trump's Facebook page saw a 45 percent drop. Diamond and Silk said their content was similarly blocked on Facebook.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Facebook, along with other social media sites have taken aggressive actions to silence conservative voices such as ourselves by deliberately restricting and weaponizing our page with algorithms that censor and repress our free speech.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Next it was YouTube, who let conservative influencers build up an audience for years, only to end up limiting their channel temporarily, demonetizing them with no warning at all. This has happened to conservative commentators like Ben Shapiro, Dave Ruben and Dennis Prager.</p><p>For many on the left, the view seems to become if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking. Just look at what's happened on the conservative speakers on college campuses. And after liberal radio hosts flopped on Air America -- remember them -- well, some democrats thought to revive the fairness doctrine to snuff out conservative talk radio. Thankfully that went nowhere. But now they've moved onto the internet and squelching political speech there.</p><p>A leaked proposal circulating amongst democrats outlines a detailed plan to take over the internet by regulating digital platforms and purging content they deem harmful or inaccurate. In other words, information they don't like. They would require social media users to be tracked and labeled according to how reasonable their content is deemed to be. Democrat Senator Chris Murphy even hinted at this yesterday, tweeting, Infowars is a tip of a giant iceberg of hates and lies, that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart. These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival or our democracy depends on it.</p><p>How dramatic. Translation: the survival of the democratic party depends on it. There's an old saying in TV and radio that content is king. Same goes for the internet. If they can shut down political speech on the grounds that it's hateful, you have to ask where does this end? If you want to see hate, check out some of the comments on my Twitter feed after the show tonight. Then you'll see hateful.</p><p>Why do leftists always seem to escape big techs censors? I don't know Louis Farrakhan comes to mind. He's a casual racist, of course, and an anti-Semite who called white people \"potential humans,\" praised Hitler and blamed Jews for 9/11.</p><p>Well he's still standing tall on his Facebook page -- has a million followers. And what about those who traffic in violence? If Facebook really cares about standards or safety, I don't think they would be granting ANTIFA chapters from coast to coast where their pages can plug their next thuggish beat down of conservatives with their black hoods and all. And by the way, if there's so much concern over conspiracy theories like the one Alex Jones peddles, well, do moments like this give social media kings pause?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP</p><p>ROSIE O'DONNELL, TV PERSONALITY: The fact of the matter is, he's not only bad because he's a liar, he's bad because he doesn't know how to inspire people or invoke that emotion in them.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: What about his rallies?</p><p>O'DONNELL: First of all, people are paid, Chris. You know that. People were paid since he went down on the escalator. He pays people to show up at those rallies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Trump pays people to go to his rallies. That would be a lot of money. She still has a YouTube channel. The truth is we conservatives always want more political speech, not less of it, even when it's offensive to us. Our only point usually about speech is limiting it if there's a direct incitement to violence, or material that is injurious to children. But political speech in general, we want more.</p><p>Now, while Facebook and apple are private companies and thus aren't actors for first amendment companies, they be really careful with these moves to circumscribe certain groups political speech, because voters in the future might just demand that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube be treated more like public utility, public utilities that have to operate in the public interest. But since a utility can't refuse to give electricity to a family because they disagree with their views or heaven forbid because they're of a different race, they act in the public interest. Ted Cruz, by the way, in response to the Alex Jones purge said tech companies have quote a degree of power and an ability to censor that William Randolph Hearst at the height of Yellow Journalism could never have imagined. They have the ability if there is a speaker that is disfavored simply to silence the speaker. Your words float off into oblivion and nobody hears them.</p><p>Well, he's right about their power. The big five tech companies are now worth an estimated $4 trillion. Well, that figure puts them above the GDP of all but seven countries on the planet. The immense size of these companies is concerning, but so too is the speed with which they can succumb to external pressure. Point in case, just three weeks ago, Mark Zuckerberg defended keeping Infowars on his platform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: If you look at the things that are getting the most distribution, people flag them as potential hoaxes, we send those to fact checkers and if those fact checkers say that it is provably false, then we will significantly reduce the distribution of that content.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why don't you want to just say, \"get off our platform\"?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: As abhorrent as some of this content can be, it gets down to this principle of giving people a voice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: So why did he end up caving here? We'll continue to demand answers for you. Remember when disgraced FBI agent Strzok texted Lisa Page about an insurance policy to keep Trump from getting elected? Remember that? Well maybe, just maybe these latest moves are the beginning of big tech's own version of an insurance policy to see that someone with Trump's views never reaches a position of authority in government again. And that's the angle.</p><p>Joining us now with a reaction, Monica Crowley from the London Center for Policy Research, Attorney Dan Gilleon and Elizabeth Heng, a Republican Congressional candidate from California who had one of her campaign ads temporarily blocked on Facebook. It's great to see all of you. Elizabeth, let's start with you because I watched your campaign ad.</p><p>And you had some images from your -- your parents' country of birth, Cambodia and, you know, the brutality of Cambodia, the Cambodian purge. And Facebook, you know, blocked it. They said what to you when you brought this up? This is some of the images from the ad. What did they say to you when you brought this up ?</p><p>ELIZABETH HENG (R), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, CALIFORNIA: They said that my -- the ad was shocking, disrespectful, and too sensational to be on Facebook. And that is -- that was absolutely maddening in so many ways for me. You know, my -- when I decided to run for Congress, I got into the race because I -- and part of my message was that great things can come from great adversity.</p><p>My parents lived through the genocide in -- in Cambodia and came to the United States as refugees. And so for some reason, Facebook found that offensive and removed my ability to advertise the campaign message.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Dan, this is kind of problematic. I mean, I think for (ph) civil libertarians -- this is more (ph) Democrats, ACLUs and (ph) amazingly quiet on this. And they have a statement on their website, but I don't don't see them on any television shows. They're too busy representing illegal immigrants. But Dan, where are the libertarians on this issue? I mean those are historical photos.</p><p>I mean, the holocaust. Are we not able to talk about that and the horrors that were perpetrated on Jews on these social media platforms? What's going on here?</p><p>DAN GILLEON, ATTORNEY: Laura -- I -- I think you need to back up a little bit. And I want to restate something that you said earlier, which is really important, that none of these companies you're talking about, they're not state actors. They're not the government. And so this whole First Amendment thing you've been talking about all along, it's out the window.</p><p>So what you're talking about here are decisions by companies on their content, something that Fox News does, something that every single media outlet does. And I think for you to go and say, listen, this is all about because we're Republicans, we're conservatives --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Where -- where's the -- where's the discrimination or the similar actions against a myriad of leftists. You saw the examples --</p><p>GILLEON: Let -- let me -- let me give you an example. Let me give you an example.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, now why isn't Antifa blocked from Facebook? Why are they still on YouTube?</p><p>GILLEON: Well maybe they should be, OK?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Laura. Laura, listen, though. But you just asked me a question. Let me answer it. You know, back -- back in 2015, being liberal was knocked right off of Facebook. Right? I -- I have a lot more -- I can assure you, I have a lot more liberal friends on my Facebook feed than a lot of your viewers do and I see them griping time and time again, every night about Facebook acting against them too and knocking them off for stupid things they say.</p><p>Facebook has made a decision and it seems like it's not that hard to understand, giving -- given the history and the $16 billion that Mr. Zuckerberg took a hit on, that he's made a decision that his company is going to start making different decisions on content they did before.</p><p>But you know Infowars, it's still out there on Instagram. It's still there. And Instagram, you know, is huge. Twitter is out there --</p><p>INGRAHAM: So -- so -- so Dan, you see no difference -- you see no difference between a cable channel -- there's how many cable channels out there? I don't even know. I mean, I don't watch most cable channels but there are a lot. From a cable channel and YouTube or Facebook or the entire Apple platform worth a trillion dollars? You see no difference as far as their control of information? Really? What's the equivalent of YouTube?</p><p>GILLEON: I'm not really sure where you're going. They're non-state actors --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Name a -- it's about controlling information. What is the equivalent of YouTube --</p><p>GILLEON: Well, Instagram -- Instagram --</p><p>INGRAHAM: YouTube.</p><p>GILLEON: I don't know. I mean you're --</p><p>INGRAHAM: There isn't one is the point.</p><p>GILLEON: Instagram? Instagram?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GILLEON: -- but they're all companies --</p><p>INGRAHAM: -- no, no, no, no, no. You don't know social media.</p><p>GILLEON: Laura --</p><p>INGRAHAM: It does not compete -- YouTube and Instagram do not compete with each other.</p><p>GILLEON: OK. Well thank you for that information.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I got to go to Monica. Monica, you see my point. Of course they're not state actors. My point is when you have an overwhelmingly left wing directorate, employees -- 100 percent of all Twitter employees for instance in 2014 contributed to Democratic causes, that's not a, you know, conservative website piece. That's a factual determination, Twitter admitted it.</p><p>CROWLEY: Yes. And it .</p><p>INGRAHAM: Doesn't have any effect? OK, I guess.</p><p>CROWLEY: . I mean, come on. Common sense points to -- to the truth about this. Look, the -- these Internet companies, they're giants, they're behemoths. They are incredibly influential and dominant. And that's the point.</p><p>To your point about Twitter, the guy who used to run tech for Twitter is now running tech for the Democratic National Committee, just in time for the midterm elections. That's just one example. We're not talking about particular content, about Infowars et cetera.</p><p>What we are talking about is that a few select companies that have near monopolies in the digital sphere are now having control over the information that is available to you. And it's only going to get worse. So we are now on this slippery slope, Laura, where they're controlling the Infowars website and so on.</p><p>But go a couple of years down the road or maybe even a shorter time period, and they -- those leftist overlords in the digital sphere will be able to deem anything that they consider unacceptable, and that's a subjective standard, inappropriate for -- for consumption, whether that's statements about Islamic fundamentalism, maybe it's .</p><p>INGRAHAM: Abortion.</p><p>CROWLEY: . to say -- abortion, maybe it's statements about .</p><p>INGRAHAM: Pro-life.</p><p>CROWLEY: . right -- pro-life or support -- support for the police. They will be able to use this sliding scale, based on what they think is appropriate rather than the First Amendment standard. And that is a very dark and dangerous place for this country to be.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Elizabeth, in -- Mark Zuckerberg was questioned about this by Ted Cruz back in April. And he -- he said, look, we're -- there's no bias. But we're going to have standards in place. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: To a great many Americans, that appears to be a pervasive pattern of political bias. Do you agree with that assessment?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I understand where that concern is coming from because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley which is an extremely left-leaning place. And I -- this is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company is making sure that we don't have any bias in the work that we do. And I think it is a fair concern that -- that people would -- would .</p><p>CRUZ: So -- so let me -- let me .</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: . at least wonder about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, that was a moment of candor from Zuckerberg. I mean, anyone who's spent any time in Silicon Valley, it's a -- it's a political monolith. I know there are conservatives there, but they probably hide their views. I don't know why, but they don't want to -- they don't want to .</p><p>HENG: Yes .</p><p>INGRAHAM: . literally do not want to say they're conservative when they work there or they'll -- they probably will lose their job. I mean, I've heard those comments, not -- not at Facebook but other high-tech companies. Elizabeth.</p><p>HENG: Yes, Laura. It's undeniable that Facebook has algorithms that lean towards and incentivize those that have more liberal tendencies. And their algorithms will promote those such as Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and my opponent Jim Costa.</p><p>And it -- this just goes to show, why did it take five days and the whole national movement for Facebook to respond to my -- my -- my ad here? This is my story. This is -- this is -- the story in which I told that they, I'm assuming had concerns with in the beginning of it, where it -- it shoed glimpses of genocide. Those weren't just photos, but my family has (ph) to (inaudible) .</p><p>INGRAHAM: So, Elizabeth, do you think -- do you think you're being targeted?</p><p>HENG: . through this.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Elizabeth, do you think you're being targeted as an Asian conservative candidate in liberal California because you represent a dangerous possibility for the left, is that what you're saying?</p><p>HENG: Yes. We constantly see this time and time again with conservatives. That from these tech -- these tech giants that the algorithms that are in place do -- do not support conservative ideologies. It is so -- and this important part about all of this is that it is so incredibly important for platforms, such as Facebook who claim to be sort of the -- the online community space, to have diverse political thoughts on there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's (ph) better, yes.</p><p>HENG: Time and time again we see that is not the case .</p><p>GILLEON: Laura .</p><p>INGRAHAM: More speech .</p><p>GILLEON: . Laura, can I .</p><p>INGRAHAM: is better for everybody. Dan, go ahead.</p><p>GILLEON: Yes. There was an Ipsos poll today, 43 percent of Americans support Trump's idea of -- of shutting down media outlets that don't behave. So this is -- this is -- goes both ways. And this is not a Republican versus a Democrat issue. I mean, I -- I -- you mentioned the ACLU. I know the ACLU really does not like any sort of infringement on anything -</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, where are they?</p><p>GILLEON: - speech related.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>GILLEON: Well, I can assure -</p><p>INGRAHAM: Where are they? We got to get Monica. They're nowhere. They're nowhere. They're focusing on illegal immigration and partisan issues.</p><p>GILLEON: Well -</p><p>INGRAHAM: Monica, really quick. We got thirty seconds.</p><p>CROWLEY: Yes, I mean, I really feel for Elizabeth because she's trying to tell the story of her family, which is the American dream, and, you know, these tech giants are trying to crush that message which is particularly appalling.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>CROWLEY: But as Elizabeth points out, they've got these algorithms. They're clearly set in a certain direction, but then they'll say, \"well, then we've got a next barrier of humans, actual human beings who are trying to review these into artificial intelligence decisions and make sure -</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, yes.</p><p>CROWLEY: - there's no bias because all of those people are on the left.\"</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. Now, they're on the left, and by the way, Jack Dorsey of Twitter today, late tonight says that Alex Jones didn't violate their policy, so Twitter so far seems to be the best of all.</p><p>Up next, President Trump made a campaign stop for him in Ohio. Can he pull off a win?</p><p>President Trump tonight facing a political test of his influence in a House special election in Ohio, and this race is neck and neck at the moment. Fox News Correspondent Kristin Fisher joins us live from the election headquarters, a republican Troy Balderson who's fighting Democrat Danny O'Connor for that Ohio House seat. Kristin, what is the latest there?</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well Laura, everyone is on the edge of their seat here at Balderson's headquarters because this race is shaping up to be exactly how the polls predicted. It is razor tight, and right literally everybody in the room has their eye on one country. There is only one country that does not have all of its precincts in, and that is Delaware County.</p><p>And this is a big deal because Delaware County is the country that President Trump came to on Saturday. It is where he held his big rally for Republican Troy Balderson. This is also a county that has been reliably Republican over the years, and yet when the early vote came in, Danny O'Connor, the Democrat, won the early vote by about 2,000 votes.</p><p>So that has everybody here very nervous. They're watching Delaware County very closely. And based on the unofficial results I'm looking at right now on the Ohio secretary of state website, we have 95 percent of the (inaudible) in Delaware County and -- and Balderson is ahead 54-45 (ph). So we'll see if that holds. The other county that we've been watching all night, Franklin County.</p><p>That's the county just outside the -- the suburbs of Columbus. This is where the Democrat, Danny O'Connor is from. It's also what the Republican, Troy Balderson had alluded to last night at his rally. He made a little bit of a (inaudible) he said, you don't want to see someone from Franklin County representing us (ph) (inaudible) Democrat Danny O'Connor of course is from Franklin County.</p><p>And now O'Connor is ahead there, 65-35. not a huge surprise there, but this is so close, Laura. The other thing I'm hearing a lot from people in the room, the possibility of an automatic recount. If the difference is 0.5 percent or less, that triggers an automatic recount. It is very close. But so far right now, still outside that automatic recount margin, Laura.</p><p>It is very exciting in here but everybody's still very nervous and cautiously optimistic. That's crazy (ph). I keep hearing over and over (inaudible) --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Kristen, certainly loud there. Great reporting. We'll continue to monitor this race and others throughout the hour and the night and bring you the results as they come in. Very exciting. Of course even if Balderson wins, the other networks will say it's really a loss for Trump. So even if he wins, he loses. So just make sure you get that right.</p><p>Well, as we touched on earlier in the angle, one of your favorites -- and I know you've missed her on daily television -- Rosie O'Donnell has gone into full conspiracy theory mode with regard to President Trump. And last night -- about how many blocks is it? 16, 17 blocks from here? O'Donnell led a sing along protest -- I kid you not -- in front of the White House with some of her fellow Hollywood and Broadway stars. Even though no one told them the president wasn't home.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSIE O'DONNELL, COMEDIAN: We are so thrilled to finally be here at the Kremlin annex on night 22. How many have been here every night? Let's hear it. And we're going to keep coming back until he's out. Let the president know in no uncertain terms that we are alive, awake and we are woke. We are not going away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Raise your hand if you're sick of woke. I am. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee joins us with a reaction. Governor, first of all, on my radio show, I played all the really bad singing. I mean, these are great Broadway stars, a lot of talent. But I don't know. The -- the chanting, no rhyming. They haven't updated the chant since like 1968 on the left. So it was very disappointing.</p><p>But what do you make of her resurgence on the scene? And the -- tonight, they were -- I went by the White House tonight. These -- these people are still out there. I guess until they feel like they can drive the president from office.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER GOVERNOR, ARKANSAS: Well, I think it's important that you know that he wasn't even there. I think they thought it was Halloween and they were there to do some early trick or treating and they scared the daylights out of people around the White House. The other thing that I believe that may perhaps solve this mystery. Where did that noise come from that damaged the ear -- the hearing of the people who were working for the state department down in the Cuban embassy.</p><p>I think we now know. Rosie and her team had gone down there and that's what caused that physical damage. One other observation, Laura. I thought Rosie had moved to Canada. You know, she promised that if Trump got elected she would go. So I don't know what she was able to do. I guess she was coming back into the country for a brief visit. Because after all, she's Canadian now, isn't she? Did I miss something?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well she -- she's a woman on a mission. I mean, she actually said to Chris Cuomo last night that Donald Trump and his organization pays people to attend his rallies. And Chris Cuomo is just like what? Pay? Well maybe -- he said, like, maybe some but he has tens of thousands of people. And then she said no he doesn't. What -- I mean, I guess she didn't remember the Mobile, Alabama rally in 2015 (ph) in August where he had 70,000 people.</p><p>I guess those were all cardboard cutouts in Rosie land.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well those cardboard cutouts are sure making a lot of noise. And I'll tell you another thing. It's absurd to say that those people are paid. Those people just happen to love their country. Now let me be fair. Rosie O'Donnell has as much right to protest and sing songs as anybody else. This is America. We're all fine with that.</p><p>But I think what we all find a little bit disingenuous is that her attitude is rather than accept the election results from 2016, suck it up and say we're going to do better next time, their idea is let's invalidate the election results because we don't like how they turned out. This is the rantings of a seven-year-old who got defeated playing baseball and decided that we're just going to overturn the game rather than just learn how to play the game a little better next time.</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Governor, not just that but now the entertainment industry on the left coast and the west Hollywood crowd has voted, I'm sure the president is devastated, to remove the president's star on the Hollywood walk of fame. So no longer will they have to guard the star. People won't pickax. This is what it's come to. This is how petty and pathetic they have become. They're going after some -- what is that, marble. I don't know what it is. But that I guess makes them feel better and they feel like they've had a good -- that's their idea of victory.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, if they're going to chop up everybody's star who has done something they don't like, they might as well rent a bunch of jackhammers because there's a lot of people on that sidewalk who represent some pretty crazy views and some things that have gotten them landed with the Me Too movement. So will we see a goodbye from Kevin Spacey, from Roman Polanski? How many of the Hollywood elites are going to have their stars chopped up because they didn't exactly do the right thing, to be charitable about it?</p><p>INGRAHAM: No. It's such a double standard. We have the -- if you're a star like James Gunn and director of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and you had bad tweets, they make an excuse for you. But if you're anyone who is a conservative, you apologize for something or make a mistake, they never forgive you. The forgiveness only ever goes one way. Governor, thank you so much.</p><p>And by the way, the showdown between the Trump legal team and Bob Mueller over that presidential interview is about to take a dramatic turn. Details, reaction, Alan Dershowitz and Wisenberg next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: A dramatic new turn may be imminent in the showdown between the Trump legal team and special prosecutor Bob Mueller. According to FOX News sources, Trump attorneys are preparing to send the special counsel a letter largely turning down any questions related to obstruction of justice during a potential presidential interview. But Rudy Giuliani gave an interview just posted on \"Politico\" where he leaves the door open to some limited questioning about obstruction, which is an interesting new development.</p><p>Will this spark, though, a major escalation between both sides in the Russia probe? Joining us now to analyze, Alan Dershowitz, author of the big bestseller, \"The Case against Impeaching Trump,\" and Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent council in the Whitewater investigation. We'll also get into the cantankerous T.S. Ellis, the federal district judge who is presiding over the Paul Manafort trial.</p><p>But let's get to this breaking news, Rudy Giuliani and this \"Politico\" interview. You probably haven't read it, either of you, but he seems to leave open the possibility of a very narrow set of questions, if it can be narrowed, on obstruction. Alan, I'll go to you first. What might be the wisdom in that?</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: I think Giuliani's tactic is to be able to say to the public, look, our president was willing to speak and Mueller turned him down. I think he's Mueller an offer that Mueller can't really accept. He's putting forth a kind of narrow window. If Mueller accepts it, then game on and we'll see some narrow questioning.</p><p>But if I were Trump's lawyer -- I'm not -- I would not under any circumstances allow him to testify, because all you need is one question in which he answers truthfully, but somebody else answers in a different way, say he says, I didn't know about the meeting at the Trump Tower involving the Russians, and Cohen says, yes, he did, then you have an opportunity to spring that perjury trap. So in the end, I don't think lawyers generally will advise a client to testify or sit down with a prosecutor. But I think this client wants to be able to say I offered to sit down and it was Mueller who turned me down. So I think that's the strategy.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Here's some of the previous conditions, Sol, placed on any potential interview that Giuliani had set out. And we'll put it up on the screen for our viewers. It can only be two to three hours long, narrow set of questions on collusion. They provide info on FBI information first, so they want that information, show proof that Trump committed a crime, show testimony is needed to end a probe, and curtail obstruction questions. So that's the one that kind of was fleshed out a little bit more tonight in Giuliani's comments to \"Politico,\" that last bullet point. Sol, you're reaction to these latest developments? Do you agree with what Professor Dershowitz is positing there?</p><p>SOLOMON WISENBERG, PARTNER, NELSON-MULLINS: No prosecutor worth his salt is going to accept those kinds of preconditions. But there's a reason -- and I do agree with, and have long agreed with Professor Dershowitz's assertion that the president shouldn't go in and answer these questions. It's far too dangerous. But there's a reason Bob Mueller has put up with this dance for so long. And I think a lot of people don't understand it.</p><p>If he issues the subpoena to force President Trump to be interviewed by him, to go to the grand jury, for example, certainly President Trump has to accept that subpoena. You can subpoena a president. But then when President Trump invokes executive privilege, under the law, the current law in the D.C. circuit in resealed case, it is going to be very difficult and time-consuming for Bob Mueller to ask the questions he wants to ask, particularly about obstructions. And there is absolutely no guarantee that he will win.</p><p>You're talking about the heart of executive privilege here, presidential communications and presidential thought processes. And Mueller would have to show that it's very, very important evidence and that he can't get it anywhere else.</p><p>And don't forget, when Jaworski won the tapes case against Nixon, and when Cox won the earlier case, they knew their subpoenas were incredibly narrowly drawn. They knew the tapes existed. They knew there were potentially incriminatory conversations on those tapes. Mueller does not have that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Very different.</p><p>WISENBERG: And more than anything else, Mueller does not have the right to even litigate executive privilege. The first thing President Trump is going to say is, I'm your boss. You can't even be in court. So the reason why Mueller has put up with these ridiculous preconditions is that he probably can't win if he goes to court.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And Alan, they have already gamed this out. You have Emmet Flood, one of the top partners at Williams and Connolly who's running this side of the legal prep inside the White House. He clerked for Justice Scalia. He was my co-clerk on the Secord Circuit for Ralph Winter. Brilliant guy. They've already gamed this out, correct? This is probably already briefed.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Yes, they had gamed it out a long time ago. Remember, that was the firm that represented Bill Clinton in his efforts to try to prevent testimony.</p><p>In addition to his claim of executive privilege, there's also constitutional argument, and that is that since a senator and a congressman can't be questioned about what they did on the floor of the Senate, I don't believe a president can be questioned about why he pardoned or why he fired or why he tweeted or why he exercised any of his powers under Article Two of the Constitution or the First Amendment.</p><p>So although I think in the end if a subpoena was issued and challenged, I think Mueller would be able to get some testimony from the president if he stayed away from issues that are covered by these privileges. But in the end it would be a Pyrrhic victory. It would take him so much time that it would guarantee that the report could not be written until after the midterm election.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Wow, we don't even have time to get to T.S. Ellis and how he was a little cantankerous. But when we have you back -- I mean, this is going to be going on for at least another week or so.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: He's a tough judge. He's a tough judge to both guys.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I love when he says, you've got to look at me when I talk to you. That's what I say to my kids. And then the lawyer's like, I'm looking at you.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: He tells the truth.</p><p>WISENBERG: He does this with everybody. He does this with everybody. But it doesn't make it right. He needs to really hold back and let the litigators try their case.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right, guys.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: But he did the right thing when he talked about Manafort and why they're going after him. He told the truth about that, a truth too few people are willing to recognize.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think he went a little far --</p><p>WISENBERG: Yes, but he doesn't need to be doing that in front of the jury, though.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But when he's saying, you have tears in your eyes --</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: That was not in front of the jury.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He says, no, I don't. I'm sorry, but it is very dramatic. But it might be a little too much. All right, guys, thanks so much.</p><p>That Ohio 12th race is still too close to call, by the way, but Republican Troy Balderson has a slight lead. We'll bring you updates when the race is called, and perhaps in a matter of moments. But next, an Iraqi immigrant who was set to be deported is now accused of putting a police officer in critical condition. The tragic story next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Our country's immigration laws lead to tragic consequences yet again. A Colorado police officer is in critical but stable condition following a gun battle last week with Karrar Noaman Al Khammasi, an Iraqi refugee. Khammasi was in federal custody awaiting deportation in 2016 after he violated probation terms from a previous trespassing plea. But his removal was halted after a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision invalidated the government's grounds for doing so.</p><p>Joining me to discuss all this is Dan Kovalik, who is an international rights lawyer and a professor and the author of the book \"The Plot to Scapegoat Russia,\" and Tom Homan is a former acting director of ICE live from the studio with me tonight. Tom, this guy was quite a beaut. He was arrested on a weapons charge, possession, a previous offender, that was in January of this year, and then leads to this horrific shooting of this police officer.</p><p>THOMAS HOMAN, FORMER ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: I think it's clear that somebody shouldn't have been allowed to stay in the country. It's a great privilege to be allowed to come to this country as a refugee or a non-immigrant. And to anybody in this country that's given such a great privilege, that's somebody that needs to leave. They need to remove that privilege and be removed from the United States and send them home.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The 10th circuit initially said in their ruling that the government didn't have a right, I think it was the description of what a violent offense is, too ambiguous of a term. So said no, that's not going to work. So once again, the courts end up making the job of enforcing commonsense immigration law much more difficult.</p><p>HOMAN: Well, I disagree with the court's decision. But as a law enforcement officer, career law enforcement officer, they ran a law enforcement agency, we have to salute and follow the court's order. However, now it's up to Congress. If they're saying the definition of crime and violence is too vague, it's up to Congress to fix it and make it not vague, because people that come to this country and commit crimes, they need to go home. We need to protect the sovereignty of this country and we need to protect public safety.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Dan, President Trump wants to reduce the number of refugees in the United States. Currently about 40,000, Hillary wanted about 100,000. He wants to bring it down to about 15,000 because difficulty vetting. We're going to do extreme vetting but we don't know how well that's working out. What's your reaction to this particular story and then the broader issue?</p><p>DANIEL KOVALIK, INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, first of all, my response is that you can never extrapolate from one example. There was a very good story in the \"Washington Post\" in June by a guy named Christopher Ingraham showing that in fact both illegal immigrants and legal immigrants commit much less crimes in fact than natural-born Americans, which needs to be kept in mind. But I also want to note if we want to look at the big picture issues, things we can extrapolate from. These wars the U.S. has been fighting, like in Iraq, have actually exacerbated the immigration issue. And if people want to deal with lower immigration, the U.S. ought to start to think about withdrawing from these wars and avoiding --</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, we're not here to debate the wars. I would probably agree with you on a lot of the wars issue. We're talking about our right, our sovereign right as a people to decide who gets to come in, and then when you're here as basically a privilege that we grant you, who doesn't get to stay. And we have violent criminals who are released onto the streets, people who are here illegally, and, Tom, as you know, who have been deported multiple times, who come back, commit heinous crimes or DWI. They have a trail of tears behind them. And we still have the ACLU out there beating the drums for more illegal immigrants in the United States. And I think this has got to stop.</p><p>KOVALIK: Statistically, immigrants commit less crimes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I don't care. That is such a meaningless statistic. They're not supposed to be here.</p><p>KOVALIK: No, it's a very important statistic.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They're not supposed to be here.</p><p>KOVALIK: He was a legal immigrant. He was legal.</p><p>HOMAN: Let me respond to the meaningless quote that he just made that illegal aliens and aliens here illegally commit less crimes than U.S. citizens. That's not the issue. The issue is how many crimes could have been prevented if they weren't here. So for people to say they commit less crimes. The question is how many crimes could have been prevented if we have secure borders and immigration law that made sense. That's the question.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And the John Lott study in Arizona which was the most definitive of any jurisdiction that's ever been done, Professor John Lott, showed that illegal aliens are 142 percent more likely to be arrested for a crime. It's specific police data culled through. It was painstakingly specific and well documented. So that's another fact.</p><p>By the way, I want to put it as one full screen. We're running long. Issues that are important to the American voters, America's top problem facing the U.S., immigration, number one at 22 percent of the public. Government, poor leadership, 19 percent, race relations down at seven percent. Healthcare is down at three percent. Immigration, Dan, the number-one issue for Americans. And I don't think it's because Americans want more illegal immigration in the United States. You can close it out real quick.</p><p>KOVALIK: I think immigrants are being scapegoated for a lot of problems that are not theirs, and I don't like people being scapegoated. I don't like the Russians being scapegoated, and I think this is a country of immigrants. My grandfather was here from --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Legal immigrants. Legal.</p><p>KOVALIK: Yes, but I don't think there's any such thing as an illegal immigrant. But in any case --</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's very revealing. Borders don't matter, countries don't matter. Let's do I tall, John Lennon song. There's no wars, there's no borders, there's no countries, there's no sovereignty, and then ultimately they'll be no freedom. Love the segment. Thank you both.</p><p>By the way, police bust a man threatening the life of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise barely a year after he was nearly killed by a gunman. Congressman Scalise joins us exclusively with his reaction next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: House Majority Whip Steve Scalise facing new threats to his life barely more than a year after he was nearly assassinated during that Congressional softball team practice. Police have arrested 63-year-old Carlos Bayon of Grand Island, New York, charging him with menacing the Congressman after leaving violent voicemail messages. Authorities discovered hundreds of rounds of ammo and firearm purchase receipts in Dayon's home along with bomb-building information.</p><p>Joining us exclusively now with his reaction is House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Congressman, it's great to see you. I'm so relieved this guy was found, this was prevented. Lord knows what might have happened. We're also awaiting the election results from Ohio 12, which we're going to talk to you about, Congressman Scalise. But your reaction to yet another violent threat against your life.</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE, (R-LA) HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: Well, Laura, it's great to be back with you. And clearly, these kinds of disturbing things, there's no place for it in politics. I first want to thank, once again, our United States capitol police. They were very quick to act when my office received this threat. They sent the information on to Capitol police. Capitol police did research, found out that this man has had some real serious concerns. And it was hard to track him down because he was trying to use aliases. But ultimately they found him. And he's in custody, in federal custody. And hopefully he gets a serious sentence, because you can't allow this kind of threats and violence against peoples based on their political views.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Congressman, did he have postings on social media about you? Was it a purely political ax to grind? Is he mentally deranged or a combination of both?</p><p>SCALISE: I guess we'll find out a lot of that. Clearly he had some strong disagreements with my political views and others. There were others that he threatened as well. And he's going to have to account to that. The Justice Department has him now. But again, my thanks and true appreciation goes out to our law enforcement, the United States Capitol police acted quickly and working with New York authority to make sure that he got into custody.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Does what you see with Antifa across the country, taking over this Portland ICE office, black hoods, the beatdowns of conservatives, intimidations of conservatives in public. You saw what happened to Charlie Kirk and his colleague Candace Owens the other morning in Philadelphia. This seems to be ratcheting up. The left blames President Trump. They say, well, he's calling the news fake news and calling them out and that's making people more and more anxious.</p><p>SCALISE: No. You look at some of the liberal rhetoric that's coming out from the left. They're encouraging and inciting, in many cases, violence. And it's got to stop. In fact, liberals need to call this out. They need to speak up, just as we're speaking up saying there's no place for it on the Republican or Democrat siding. I think people on the left need to be as vocal about calling out this kind of violence.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We were talking about Facebook and Apple moving against more conservative voice beyond Alex Jones but to other conservatives who have seen their voices diminished on these mega-platforms, trillions of dollars of market cap in these companies. Are you concerned that groups like Antifa, which have incited violence at these rallies, they have -- I mean, they continue on YouTube and so forth and Facebook seemingly with impunity, other groups like them.</p><p>SCALISE: Yes, it's clearly a double standard. We've pointed some of this out. In fact, when Mark Zuckerberg testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee that I sit on just a few weeks ago, I brought this up, the bias that we're seeing on Facebook since they put a new algorithm in place to change the way that people get their newsfeeds, and where they're literally starting to filter in, from what we've seen, a left-leaning way and having a bias against conservatives. We've raised it to them, and they have gotten back to me to let me know that this is something they're looking into. But we need to watch it closely, because if they get into a position where it looks like they're trying to become the platform of the left, there are other social media sites people can go to and will go to if it becomes a liberal site. They don't want their site to become a liberal --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, a monopoly. We don't want them to have monopoly power.</p><p>We're almost out of time. You predict this Ohio 12 is going to go Republican, Congressman, yes or no?</p><p>SCALISE: I do. And the numbers that are coming in our strong. President Trump going in, Laura, I think really helped swing this race to the Republican side. It was neck and neck all the way.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Congressman Scalise, thank you so much. We'll have results.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Before we go, let's take a quick look at the latest results in that special election for Ohio's 12th Congressional district, still neck in next with Republican Troy Balderson with a razor thin lead over Democrat Danny O'Connor. Balderson is expected to speak to supporters at any moment.</p><p>And lucky, Shannon Bream and the \"FOX News at Night\" team are up next. They're going to have it all covered and the live event, the live presser then. Shannon, it doesn't get more exciting than this. It's like less than one point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018080701cb257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0B-K451-JB20-G4WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7961\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 7, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

I don?(EURO)(TM)t think anyone would argue that the terrorist on the 15th of March had a right to livestream the murder of 50 people. And that is what this call is specifically focused on.?(EURO)  </p><p>Even viewed in a vacuum, Ardern?(EURO)(TM)s specific focus poses complex questions: What do we define as terrorism? What types of groups do we allow on social media? And do we continue to permit anyone in the world to livestream when they please?  </p><p>Social media organisations get away with such a bare-minimum response to fake news and extreme content only because they have long been able to hide behind the fact that they are only platforms, not media channels. This rule remains enshrined in the Communications Decency Act passed by Congress in 1996.  </p><p>Without the burden of having to employ the staff numbers necessary to run a media company responsibly, the big tech companies?(EURO)(TM) profits have soared. And the tech giants aren?(EURO)(TM)t simply going to sit back and watch their margins being ripped apart by the efforts of a few foreign governments.  </p><p>Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s Mark Zuckerberg has already called in reinforcements, this week appointing Jennifer Newstead as general counsel, tasked with defending Facebook as international pressure mounts. Newstead isn?(EURO)(TM)t your standard, run-of-the-mill lawyer. She was plucked straight out of Trump?(EURO)(TM)s State Department and previously played a major role in selling the Patriot Act to the US Congress.  </p><p>Ardern and Macron better come prepared for a fight.     </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WANCHR-WIC27aprcomment</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WANCHR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W01-2901-F12B-J132-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459378</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NZME Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Whanganui Chronicle</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 27, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
