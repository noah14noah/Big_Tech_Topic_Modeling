Lawmakers want to tell you, but it's not that easy to calculate  Your social media data is immeasurably valuable. 13_Phunkhod/Shutterstock.com[1]  Courtesy ofSamuel Lengen[2], University of Virginia[3] New proposed legislation[4] by U.S. senators Mark R. Warner and Josh Hawley seeks to protect privacy by forcing tech companies to disclose the 'true value[5]' of their data to users. Specifically, companies with more than 100 million users would have to provide each user with an assessment of the financial value of their data, as well as reveal revenue generated by 'obtaining, collecting, processing, selling, using or sharing user data[6].' In addition, the DASHBOARD Act would give users the right to delete their data[7] from companies' databases. </p><p>As a researcher[8] exploring the ethical and political implications of digital platforms and big data, I'm sympathetic to the bill's ambition of increasing transparency and empowering users. However, estimating the value of user data isn't simple and won't, I believe, solve privacy issues. Data collectors The data collected by tech companies consists not just of traditional identifying information such as name, age and gender. Rather, as Harvard historian Rebecca Lemov has noted, it includes 'Tweets, Facebook likes, Twitches, Google searches, online comments, one-click purchases, even viewing-but-skipping-over a photograph in your feed[9].' In other words, big data contains the mundane yet intimate moments of people's lives. And, if Facebook captures your interactions with friends and family, Google your late night searches, and Alexa your living room commands, wouldn't you want to know, as the bill suggests, what your 'data is worth and to whom it is sold[10]'? However, calculating the value of user data isn't that simple. Estimates on what user data is worth vary widely. They include evaluations of less than a dollar for an average person's data[11] to a slightly more generous US$100 for a Facebook user. One user sold his data for $2,733 on Kickstarter[12]. To achieve this number, he had to share data including keystrokes, mouse movements and frequent screenshots. Sadly, the DASHBOARD Act doesn't specify how it would estimate the value of user data. Instead, it explains that the Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent federal government agency, 'shall develop a method or methods for calculating the value of user data[13].' The commission, I believe, will quickly realize that estimating the value of user data is a challenging undertaking. <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/283386/original/file-20190709-44487-1nbzlit.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/283386/original/file-20190709-44487-1nbzlit.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>  One study estimated that a user's Facebook profile was worth about $100. nevodka/Shutterstock.com[14]  More than personal The proposed legislation aims to provide users with more transparency. However, privacy is no longer solely a matter of personal data. Data shared by a few[15] can provide insights into the lives of many. Facebook likes, for example, can help predict a user's sexual orientation[16] with a high degree of accuracy. Target has used its purchase data to predict which customers are pregnant. The case garnered widespread attention after the retailer figured out a teen girl was pregnant before her father did[17]. Such predictive ability means that private information isn't just contained in user data. Companies can also infer your private information, based on statistical correlations in the data of a number of users. How can the value of such data be reduced to an individual dollar value? It is more than the sum of its parts. What's more, this ability to use statistical analysis to identify people as belonging to a group category can have far-reaching privacy implications. If service providers can use predictive analytics[18] to guess a user's sexual orientation, race, gender and religious belief, what is to stop them from discriminating on that basis? Having been let loose, predictive technologies will continue to work even if users delete their part of the data that helped create them. Control through data The sensitivity of data depends not just on what it contains, but on how governments and companies can use it to exert influence. This is evident in my current research[19] on China's planned social credit system[20]. The Chinese government plans to use national databases and 'trustworthiness ratings' to regulate the behavior of Chinese citizens. Google's, Amazon's and Facebook's 'surveillance capitalism[21],' as author Shoshana Zuboff has argued, also uses predictive data to 'tune and herd our behaviour towards the most profitable outcomes[22].' In 2014, revelations about how Facebook experimented with its feed to influence the emotional state of users[23] ended in a public outcry. However, this instance just made visible how digital platforms, in general, can use data to keep users engaged and, in the process, generate more data. Data privacy is as much about big tech's ability to shape your personal life as about what it knows about you.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/283387/original/file-20190709-44437-7boqsv.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/283387/original/file-20190709-44437-7boqsv.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>  China's social credit system will use internet data to evaluate a person's behavior. pcruciatti/Shutterstock.com[24]  Who is harmed The truth is that datafication, with all its privacy implications, does not affect everyone equally. Big data's hidden biases[25] and networked discrimination[26] continue to reproduce inequalities around gender, race and class. Women, minorities and the financially poor are most strongly affected. UCLA professor Safiya Umoja Noble, for example, has shown how Google search rankings reinforce negative stereotypes about women of color[27]. In light of such inequality how could a numerical value ever capture the 'true' value of user data? The proposed legislations's lack of specificity is disconcerting. However, even more troubling might be its insistence that data transparency will be achieved by revealing monetary value alone. Numeric assessments of financial worth don't reflect data's power to predict our actions or guide our decisions. The DASHBOARD Act aims to make the business of data more transparent and empower users. However, I believe that it will fail to fulfill this promise. If lawmakers want to tackle data privacy, they need to regulate not just data monetization, but more widely address the value and cost of data in people's lives.

Warner and Josh Hawley seeks to protect privacy by forcing tech companies to disclose the 'true value' of their data to users.Specifically, companies with more than 100 million users would have to provide each user with an assessment of the financial value of their data, as well as reveal revenue generated by 'obtaining, collecting, processing, selling, using or sharing user data[1].' In addition, the DASHBOARD Act would give users the right todelete their datafrom companies' databases.As a researcherexploring the ethical and political implications of digital platforms and big data, I'm sympathetic to the bill's ambition of increasing transparency and empowering users. However, estimating the value of user data isn't simple and won't, I believe, solve privacy issues.Data collectorsThe data collected by tech companies consists not just of traditional identifying information such as name, age and gender. Rather, as Harvard historian Rebecca Lemov has noted, it includes[2] 'Tweets, Facebook likes, Twitches, Google searches, online comments, one-click purchases, even viewing-but-skipping-over a photograph in your feed.'In other words, big data contains the mundane yet intimate moments of people's lives. And, if Facebook captures your interactions with friends and family, Google your late night searches, and Alexa your living room commands, wouldn't you want to know, as the bill suggests, what your 'data is worth and to whom it is sold'?</p><p>However, calculating the value of user data isn't that simple. Estimates on what user data is worth vary widely. They include evaluations ofless than a dollar for an average person's datato a slightly more generous US$100 for a Facebook user.One user sold his data for $2,733 on Kickstarter. To achieve this number, he had to share data including keystrokes, mouse movements and frequent screenshots.Sadly, the DASHBOARD Act doesn't specify how it would estimate the value of user data. Instead, it explains that the Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent federal government agency, 'shall develop a method or methods for calculating the value of user data.' The commission, I believe, will quickly realize that estimating the value of user data is a challenging undertaking.

Photo: LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP/Getty Images More than personalThe proposed legislation aims to provide users with more transparency. However, privacy is no longer solely a matter of personal data.Data shared by a fewcan provide insights into the lives of many.Facebook likes, for example, can helppredict a user's sexual orientationwith a high degree of accuracy. Target has used its purchase data to predict which customers are pregnant. The case garnered widespread attention after the retailerfigured out a teen girl was pregnant before her father did.Such predictive ability means that private information isn't just contained in user data. Companies can also infer your private information, based on statistical correlations in the data of a number of users. How can the value of such data be reduced to an individual dollar value? It is more than the sum of its parts.What's more, this ability to use statistical analysis to identify people as belonging to a group category can have far-reaching privacy implications. If service providers canuse predictive analyticsto guess a user's sexual orientation, race, gender and religious belief, what is to stop them from discriminating on that basis?Having been let loose, predictive technologies will continue to work even if users delete their part of the data that helped create them.Control through dataThe sensitivity of data depends not just on what it contains, but on how governments and companies can use it to exert influence.This is evident in mycurrent researchon China's plannedsocial credit system. The Chinese government plans to use national databases and 'trustworthiness ratings' to regulate the behavior of Chinese citizens.Google's, Amazon's and Facebook's 'surveillance capitalism,' as author Shoshana Zuboff has argued, also uses predictive data to 'tune and herd our behaviour towards the most profitable outcomes.'In 2014, revelations about howFacebook experimented with its feed to influence the emotional state of usersended in a public outcry. However, this instance just made visible how digital platforms, in general, can use data to keep users engaged and, in the process, generate more data.Data privacy is as much about big tech's ability to shape your personal life as about what it knows about you.Who is harmedThe truth is that datafication, with all its privacy implications, does not affect everyone equally.Big data'shidden biasesandnetworked discriminationcontinue to reproduce inequalities around gender, race and class. Women, minorities and the financially poor are most strongly affected. UCLA professor Safiya Umoja Noble, for example, has shown howGoogle search rankings reinforce negative stereotypes about women of color.In light of such inequality how could a numerical value ever capture the 'true' value of user data?The proposed legislations's lack of specificity is disconcerting. However, even more troubling might be its insistence that data transparency will be achieved by revealing monetary value alone. Numeric assessments of financial worth don't reflect data's power to predict our actions or guide our decisions.The DASHBOARD Act aims to make the business of data more transparent and empower users. However, I believe that it will fail to fulfill this promise. If lawmakers want to tackle data privacy, they need to regulate not just data monetization, but more widely address the value and cost of data in people's lives.Samuel Lengen[3] is aResearch Associate at Data Science Institute, University of Virginia.This article originally appeared inThe Conversation[4].

Sadly, the DASHBOARD Act doesn't specify how it would estimate the value of user data. Instead, it explains that the Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent federal government agency, 'shall develop a method or methods for calculating the value of user data[10].' The commission, I believe, will quickly realize that estimating the value of user data is a challenging undertaking. More Than PersonalThe proposed legislation aims to provide users with more transparency. However, privacy is no longer solely a matter of personal data. Data shared by a few[11] can provide insights into the lives of many. Facebook likes, for example, can help predict a user's sexual orientation[12] with a high degree of accuracy. Target has used its purchase data to predict which customers are pregnant. The case garnered widespread attention after the retailer figured out a teen girl was pregnant before her father did[13]. Having been let loose, predictive technologies will continue to work even if users delete their part of the data that helped create them. Such predictive ability means that private information isn't just contained in user data. Companies can also infer your private information, based on statistical correlations in the data of a number of users. How can the value of such data be reduced to an individual dollar value? It is more than the sum of its parts. What's more, this ability to use statistical analysis to identify people as belonging to a group category can have far-reaching privacy implications. If service providers can use predictive analytics[14] to guess a user's sexual orientation, race, gender, and religious belief, what is to stop them from discriminating on that basis? Having been let loose, predictive technologies will continue to work even if users delete their part of the data that helped create them.Control Through DataThe sensitivity of data depends not just on what it contains, but on how governments and companies can use it to exert influence. This is evident in my current research[15] on China's planned social credit system[16]. The Chinese government plans to use national databases and 'trustworthiness ratings' to regulate the behavior of Chinese citizens. Data privacy is as much about big tech's ability to shape your personal life as about what it knows about you. Google's, Amazon's, and Facebook's 'surveillance capitalism[17],' as author Shoshana Zuboff has argued, also uses predictive data to 'tune and herd our behaviour towards the most profitable outcomes[18].' In 2014, revelations about how Facebook experimented with its feed to influence the emotional state of users[19] ended in a public outcry. However, this instance just made visible how digital platforms, in general, can use data to keep users engaged and, in the process, generate more data. Data privacy is as much about big tech's ability to shape your personal life as about what it knows about you.Who Is HarmedThe truth is that datafication, with all its privacy implications, does not affect everyone equally. Big data's hidden biases[20] and networked discrimination[21] continue to reproduce inequalities around gender, race, and class. Women, minorities, and the financially poor are most strongly affected. UCLA professor Safiya Umoja Noble, for example, has shown how Google search rankings reinforce negative stereotypes about women of color[22]. In light of such inequality, how could a numerical value ever capture the 'true' value of user data? If lawmakers want to tackle data privacy, they need to more widely address the value and cost of data in people's lives. The proposed legislation's lack of specificity is disconcerting. However, even more troubling might be its insistence that data transparency will be achieved by revealing monetary value alone. Numeric assessments of financial worth don't reflect data's power to predict our actions or guide our decisions. The DASHBOARD Act aims to make the business of data more transparent and empower users. However, I believe that it will fail to fulfill this promise. If lawmakers want to tackle data privacy, they need to regulate not just data monetization, but more widely address the value and cost of data in people's lives.

Warner and Josh Hawley seeks to protect privacy by forcing tech companies to disclose the \"true value\" of their data to users.<br/>Specifically, companies with more than 100 million users would have to provide each user with an assessment of the financial value of their data, as well as reveal revenue generated by \"obtaining, collecting, processing, selling, using or sharing user data.\"Estimating the value of user data isn't simple and won't, I believe, solve privacy issues. In addition, the DASHBOARD Act would give users the right to delete their data from companies' databases.</p><p><br/>As a researcher exploring the ethical and political implications of digital platforms and big data, I'm sympathetic to the bill's ambition of increasing transparency and empowering users. However, estimating the value of user data isn't simple and won't, I believe, solve privacy issues.<br/>Data Collectors<br/>The data collected by tech companies consists not just of traditional identifying information such as name, age, and gender. Rather, as Harvard historian Rebecca Lemov has noted, it includes \"Tweets, Facebook likes, Twitches, Google searches, online comments, one-click purchases, even viewing-but-skipping-over a photograph in your feed.\"<br/>In other words, big data contains the mundane yet intimate moments of people's lives. And, if Facebook captures your interactions with friends and family, Google your late-night searches, and Alexa your living room commands, wouldn't you want to know, as the bill suggests, what your \"data is worth and to whom it is sold\"? \u00a0<br/>The commission, I believe, will quickly realize that estimating the value of user data is a challenging undertaking. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>However, calculating the value of user data isn't that simple. Estimates on what user data is worth vary widely. They include evaluations of less than a dollar for an average person's data to a slightly more generous US$100 for a Facebook user. One user sold his data for $2,733 on Kickstarter. To achieve this number, he had to share data including keystrokes, mouse movements, and frequent screenshots.<br/>Sadly, the DASHBOARD Act doesn't specify how it would estimate the value of user data. Instead, it explains that the Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent federal government agency, \"shall develop a method or methods for calculating the value of user data.\" The commission, I believe, will quickly realize that estimating the value of user data is a challenging undertaking. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>More Than Personal<br/>The proposed legislation aims to provide users with more transparency. However, privacy is no longer solely a matter of personal data. Data shared by a few can provide insights into the lives of many.<br/>Facebook likes, for example, can help predict a user's sexual orientation with a high degree of accuracy. Target has used its purchase data to predict which customers are pregnant.

However, this instance just made visible how digital platforms, in general, can use data to keep users engaged and, in the process, generate more data.<br/>Data privacy is as much about big tech's ability to shape your personal life as about what it knows about you.<br/>Who Is Harmed<br/>The truth is that datafication, with all its privacy implications, does not affect everyone equally.<br/>Big data's hidden biases and networked discrimination continue to reproduce inequalities around gender, race, and class. Women, minorities, and the financially poor are most strongly affected. UCLA professor Safiya Umoja Noble, for example, has shown how Google search rankings reinforce negative stereotypes about women of color.<br/>In light of such inequality, how could a numerical value ever capture the \"true\" value of user data?<br/>If lawmakers want to tackle data privacy, they need to more widely address the value and cost of data in people's lives.<br/>The proposed legislation's lack of specificity is disconcerting. However, even more troubling might be its insistence that data transparency will be achieved by revealing monetary value alone. Numeric assessments of financial worth don't reflect data's power to predict our actions or guide our decisions.<br/>The DASHBOARD Act aims to make the business of data more transparent and empower users. However, I believe that it will fail to fulfill this promise. If lawmakers want to tackle data privacy, they need to regulate not just data monetization, but more widely address the value and cost of data in people's lives.<br/>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

You get off a call with an old friend. A moment later, the phone rings again. It's an operator from AT&amp;T, the world's second largest corporation (after IBM) by market capitalization.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Good news!\" says the operator. \"Based on what you and your old friend were just saying, our partner retailers have some great products we know you'll be interested in. Oh, and by the way, some of your comments about immigration violated our hate speech policy, so we're going to have to suspend you temporarily.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1980, this would have been unthinkable.</p><p>AT&amp;T couldn't spy on our personal lives, much less market them, or decide which opinions were too offensive to be uttered. Today, Facebook, Google and other internet giants routinely do what AT&amp;T never did. This little change in 21st-century telecommunications explains why we're now facing the greatest threat to privacy in American history.</p><p>Big Tech has outdone Big Brother. Devices listen in on us at home. Our movements are recorded, our purchases tracked, our online explorations monitored. When it comes to invading privacy, surveillance capitalism is even better than a surveillance state.</p><p>Flawed solutions</p><p>Now is the time to deal with these threats. The internet is still young, and political will exists for change. Unfortunately, policymakers may be heading in the wrong direction, pursuing two big-government regulatory strategies modeled on the treatment of AT&amp;T - strategies that are both ill-suited for the digital world and misdirected because AT&amp;T never threatened privacy the way Big Tech does today.</p><p>The incompetence, inflexibility, lack of creativity, short-termism, capture and corruption endemic to government-controlled projects bode poorly for the shape-shifting internet, where innovation is crucial and new technologies emerge every week. Bureaucrats can't get high-speed rail to America; our public schools are among the worst-performing in the world, measured in dollars per outcome; our infrastructure is crumbling nationwide. Do we really want the internet run by government, too?</p><p>And if the goal is protecting privacy, this is another poor idea. To begin with, it's not clear that even the biggest internet behemoths are actually illegal monopolies (as opposed to just very successful businesses), so this strategy is guaranteed to be fought in court for years and years, wasting resources, paralyzing the industry and possibly failing in the end.</p><p>Ultimately, the public-utility and antitrust strategies are big-government regulatory weapons created for the last war. They were suited to AT&amp;T, but AT&amp;T never did the most problematic thing that Facebook and Google do: harvest our personal data for profit. Solving the issue will require a specialized fix, not a bureaucratic bulldozer.</p><p>Let the market decide</p><p>The obvious alternative to rule-by-bureaucracy is a free market.</p><p>Why a market-based approach for privacy? Because - unlike the right to vote, for example, or the freedom of speech, or the liberty of conscience - you can sell your privacy. If you want to exchange your most personal data for cash, you can. Privacy is not absolutely protected whether we like it or not. It's protected only as much as we value it.</p><p>And it's an open question how much Americans still value privacy. As the philosopher Anita Allen has written, American culture seems more exhibitionist today than privacy-loving. Those who came of age with social media are used to sharing their personal lives online (in mind-numbing detail), despite knowing that what they post isn't private. There's nothing wrong with this. People have a right to decide for themselves how much they value their privacy. Markets are good at that.</p><p>Take Facebook. Currently, Facebook pays nothing for its users' data. As a result, some have demanded compensation for users, claiming that Facebook commits a kind of theft when it profits from our data without paying for it. This is a market-based approach, but the wrong one. It wouldn't help people who don't want to share their data in the first place, and besides, Facebook already does compensate users for their data - with extremely valuable online services offered free of charge.</p><p>The right approach is not to force Facebook to pay users for their data. It's to let users pay Facebook for their privacy.</p><p>Instead of burying its privacy notifications deep inside click-wrap, take-it-or-leave-it \"Terms of Service\" that no one reads, Facebook should be required to give every user a straightforward, disaggregated, easy-access menu of yes-or-no privacy options - for a price. \"Do you agree to our sharing this kind of personal data with these kinds of third parties?\" \"Do you agree to our adding your personal data from this application to your personal data from these other applications?\" And so on. If users answer yes, they could continue on Facebook for free. If not, they could still get Facebook, but they'd have to pay.</p><p>The price of privacy</p><p>How much? Valuing a single user's data is artificial (because the real value of user data lies in aggregation), but as a rough starting point, consider Facebook's average revenue per user. Grossing about $60-70 billion annually, Facebook reported an ARPU of about $112 in 2018 in the U.S. market. (The figure was about $25 worldwide.) In other words, if every American Facebook user paid about $112 a year, Facebook could duplicate its 2018 U.S. revenues without any data-mining (or advertising) at all. Would Americans be willing to pay Facebook less than $10 a month for their privacy? Many probably wouldn't; some would. Let them choose for themselves.</p><p>What about giving users the same privacy options without having to pay? That sounds great, but it would treat Facebook as a kind of free public utility, required to provide its services to individuals from whom it gets nothing in return. As a result, Big Tech would be sure to fight such measures tooth and nail - and would probably win, whether legislatively or judicially. A pay-for-privacy approach should, by contrast, bring Big Tech to the table.</p><p>A privacy market will not be trivial to set up. People don't fully understand what's being done with their data, externalities exist, and market mechanisms would have to be found to give Facebook an incentive to price its services competitively for users who opt out of data-sharing. But properly structured, an optional pay-for-privacy solution should get Big Tech's buy-in while letting individuals decide for themselves how much their privacy is really worth to them.</p><p>Jed Rubenfeld is the Robert R.

While they've dealt with a good part of the intraday downswing, they couldn't close the opening bearish gap. How does the bullish case look at the moment? S &amp; P 500 in the Short-Run We'll open this section by quoting from today's intraday Stock Trading Alert that we've posted prior to this regular article (charts courtesy of http://stockcharts.com ):(...) S &amp; P 500 opened lower yesterday, and despite the selling pressure during the session, prices held up relatively well. Having closed at 2912, the breakout above 61.8% Fibonacci retracement has been however rejected.Given the positive market reaction to Big Tech earnings earlier this week, it was reasonable to expect a similar reaction to the Amazon (AMZN) report after the markets closed yesterday. </p><p>The company's revenue managed to beat expectations, having risen 26%, yet the Q1 profit fell to $2.5bn from $3.6bn in the prior year. The market deemed it underwhelming, and the stock soundly declined in aftermarket trading, dragging the index lower along.Prices declined steeply in the overnight trading, extending yesterday's moderate downswing. That's how yesterday's session looks on the daily chart:<br/>The daily candle and volume examination leans in favor of an early stage of a downswing. The chart itself though doesn't preclude a consolidation phase coupled with a renewed run to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. Given the sizable volume of last two sessions though, such a run would have little change of overcoming this resistance, which is also reinforced by the zone defining the early March bearish gap.The fly in the ointment is the reaction to Amazon earnings. This steep a selloff makes it more than likely that the bear leg has already started in earnest, without a renewed attempt to reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.All right, as the S &amp; P 500 futures trade now at around 2835, does that mean we won't get a better price point to exit our long position? Regardless of the deterioration we have seen in many S &amp; P 500 sectors yesterday, we're likely to be offered an opportunity to reassess the outlook and our decision (coupled with a better price point than the current one).As a result, we're of the opinion that exiting the open long position at this moment (4:10 AM EST) isn't justified.Indeed, prices have moved to 2850 just before 5:00 AM EST. But the point is not about selling having momentarily waned. It's about both the credit markets and S &amp; P 500 sectoral strength. Let's start with the debt markets. The Credit Markets' Point of View<br/>The high yield corporate debt to short-term Treasuries ratio (HYG:SHY) held up well on a daily basis. The volume examination of the HYG ETF itself (and also of municipals, the HYD ETF) is encouraging - the short-term debt markets aren't showing signs of deterioration.However, this can't be said about investment grade corporate bonds to the longer-dated Treasuries ratio (LQD:IEI).<br/>It's not a good short-term omen that the decline in the ratio was driven primarily by the declining high quality corporate debt. Unless this gets reversed and we see a breakout higher out of the bullish flag, this doesn't bode for the risk-on environment. Key S &amp; P 500 Sectors in Focus<br/>The daily candle in the tech sector doesn't lean in the direction of immediate gains. We've already mentioned the Amazon (AMZN) situation. Soon after the open, we'll see the extent of damage suffered throughout the sector, and assess the ability of the bulls to recover.<br/>While healthcare didn't decline much, it's in a precarious technical situation. The deteriorating daily indicators point to short-term downside, and higher volume of yesterday's session points to increasing involvement of the sellers. Just as in tech, the buyers' ability to come back will guide our upcoming trading decision.As the credit markets didn't give all too clear signals yesterday, which way did the financials move?<br/>They moved down, but could prove more resilient than healthcare in the upcoming test of the bulls.As for energy (XLE ETF), materials (XLB ETF) and industrials (XLI ETF), it's these sectors that have us on the edge. They all declined. While it can turn out to be the opening salvo in their own downside reversals, their individual charts point rather in the direction of only a short-term setback. This is because their prior upswings have made it above their preceding local highs, and also the volume increase on their yesterday's downswing didn't rise as much as it did in either in tech or healthcare. From the Readers' Mailbag Q: I'm very much a bear with where this market is right now, however I finally went long based on your analysis, and I caught the last big leg up. So thank you! However, today (today's premarket session) has been brutal...A: Yes, the disconnect between the real economy incoming data and the stock market strength is palpable. However, we trade the stock market, and have to be keenly aware of what's going on there.That's right, the Amazon disappointment is a setback, and we'll be monitoring the buyers as they go about repairing the damage. So far, it's nothing to call home about, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet, we mean right now.That however can't be said about the moment that is much nearer to when you reading this article (10:35 AM EST). The weak reaction to a positive surprise in the ISM Manufacturing PMI number didn't really lift stocks. While the market can move in tricky ways in the very short-term, we see sideways to bearish bias as the ruling one right now. As it's reflected in both the credit markets and selected key S &amp; P 500 sectors right now, we have just taken a new trading decision. How will it pay off? Summary Summing up, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement challenge fizzled out yesterday, and given the Amazon aftermarket developments, the S &amp; P 500 is bound to open lower later today. The credit markets' message is rather inconclusive in the very short-term, but the cracks in the sectoral performance are more apparent. Monitoring the extent of the bulls' comeback has formed the basis for our upcoming trading decisions. Earlier today, the open long position remained justified as we were likely to be offered a better exit point down the road. And we indeed were. Then, a new trading decision followed...We encourage you to sign up for our daily newsletter - it's free and if you don't like it, you can unsubscribe with just 2 clicks.

It may be the greatest concentration of wealth on a single video call the world has yet seen. The four men were worth a combined $265.8 billion on July 23\u2014more than Finland\u2019s GDP, or the market cap of Disney\u2019s entire business. They\u2019ll answer questions about whether their companies have grown too large or whether their business practices stifle competition.   Even among tech titans, wealth inequality is rampant. Pichai and Cook\u2019s combined net worth is a rounding error in their colleagues\u2019 fortunes. More than two thirds of the money belongs to Bezos. Nearly all of the remaining third belongs to Mark Zuckerberg.   These numbers are a rough estimate: Bezos\u2019s wealth rises and falls by the billions every day, depending on Amazon\u2019s stock price. And while Forbes clocks fluctuations in Bezos and Zuckerberg \u2019s fortunes in real time, we relied on 2019 estimates published in The Street for Pichai and Cook .   On the other side of the screen, the lawmakers who will be grilling the tech titans are worth $47.1 million collectively, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics .   Nearly half of that belongs to Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican congressman from Wisconsin. (His great-great grandfather invented the Kotex sanitary napkin and later became the president of Kimberly-Clark.)   Collectively, the subcommittee\u2019s 15 members hold .02% as much wealth as the four CEOs do. But for a few hours on Monday, they\u2019ll grill the executives for all they\u2019re worth. The hearing, which will inform lawmakers\u2019 attempts to regulate or even break up the CEOs\u2019 businesses, could have real implications for the future of their fortunes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42672162603</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60F1-MMN1-JCSC-J1Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"353\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Quartz</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 24, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001PIA</classCode><className>KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Take Facebook, which has been rolling out a new health tab connecting you to doctors, reminding you to get your annual physical. Or take Google, which announced this month it is acquiring Fitbit. So how much control do we have? How much control should we have over how much of our personal health data ends up in the hands of tech giants? It's All Tech Considered.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ULRICH SCHNAUSS' \"NOTHING HAPPENS IN JUNE\")                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 I am joined by Ben Moskowitz. He's director of Consumer Reports' Digital Lab. Hi, Ben.             </p><p>BEN MOSKOWITZ:                 Hello.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 So I mentioned Facebook. I mentioned Google. Give us a sense of the landscape. What other companies have access into this particular slice of my life these days?             </p><p>BEN MOSKOWITZ:                 Five of the top six companies by market cap are tech companies. So we're talking about Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon. And, you know, they need to continue growing. And so if you look across the marketplace, where is there great, tremendous potential for growth? It's health care.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 And what is the impact of this? Let's start with the examples that I just listed. Google buying Fitbit, for example, which I should mention for those of us not tethered to our Fitbits, it knows how many steps we walk. It knows how many hours we sleep. It knows, for women, when we're getting our periods and so forth. What are the pros and cons of Google knowing these kinds of things about us?             </p><p>BEN MOSKOWITZ:                 Well, from Google's perspective, you know, they want to create a product ecosystem that makes life easy for people just in terms of the functionality they get from these products. You know, in a certain light, the more data that can be collected about a person, the more valuable the insight about that person that can be sold to advertisers.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 So that's the bottom line is they want to collect this data so that they can sell it.             </p><p>BEN MOSKOWITZ:                 That's right.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Sum up for me - so what is the downside here? From my point of view, if all of my data is going into my Apple Watch or my now about to be Google Fitbit or whatever it is, what's the risk?             </p><p>BEN MOSKOWITZ:                 You don't want people knowing everything about you the same way that when you go out in public, you wear clothes or you present in a certain way. Another harm is manipulation. So in the abstract here, you know, Google's a supercomputer. And if it's a supercomputer that knows all about who you are and how you think and what you want, imagine that supercomputer targeted at you and, you know, knowing that at a certain time of day, this is the kind of appeal that is going to land right.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 What about - I'm thinking of this form that I have to sign every time I go to the doctor - the HIPAA privacy rule, which is supposed to regulate things like exactly this, I thought. How much of my personal medical data is being shared amongst companies and providers? Does that apply when I download some fitness tracker on my cellphone?             </p><p>BEN MOSKOWITZ:                 No, it does not. And that's precisely the issue is that if you were to go to a hospital and create a health record, they would be governed under HIPAA and so they would have strict limitations on what they could do with that data. If you download a random app out of the App Store, the Google Play Store, then you wouldn't. And you could read - you know, they might say - they might claim to be HIPAA-compliant, but unless you read that privacy policy super closely, you know, you might not realize that they're sharing it for all kinds of purposes.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 I'm also thinking about a lot of the apps I download, I pick the free version, but there's a version that I could pay for. Do I have more privacy protections if I pay for it? In other words, are we starting to think about medical privacy as this expensive add-on that I have to pay for?             </p><p>BEN MOSKOWITZ:                 It depends, and it all goes down to what does the privacy policy say? But even, you know, if you read the privacy policy, it might be written in an overly broad way. It might be written in a way that says something very vague, like, you know, we may, in order to provide you with this service, share the information with X party. And beyond that, you just wouldn't know.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Have we reached a tipping point, though, do you think, where we have all become so reliant on technology and our gadgets that we're willing to trade away a lot of our privacy for the convenience that they provide, whether it's health care or anything else?             </p><p>BEN MOSKOWITZ:                 What we know is that Americans really care about privacy. They feel like they don't have control over their personal information. In fact, just 9% of people in a nationally representative survey believed that they had a lot of control over the information. But the vast majority, though, think it's very important to be in control of who can get information - 74%.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Yeah, we care but we feel powerless.             </p><p>BEN MOSKOWITZ:                 That's right. This is why I think it's a collective action problem. A lot of companies now are going out of their way to advertise and say, we provide you with granular privacy controls. And that's certainly a step in the right direction, but that's not going to solve the problem because not every company is going to be aboveboard in that way.

Onlookers stared at a temporary stage decked out with a banner that read, \"Celebrating 20 Years of Salesforce!\" Onstage, flanked by backup dancers, stood a man dressed in a full black suit singing a familiar tune:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They can't, they won't, they never will stop the party.\" </p><p>\"Is this Pitbull?\" I asked a middle-aged man in a corporate-branded Patagonia vest.</p><p>He just nodded as he stared ahead.</p><p>\"Y'all having a good time out there?\" Pitbull asked to silence. </p><p>A good time shouldn't be hard to come by in San Francisco, but don't blame us for being antsy. If $24 lunch salads, multiplying tent cities and two-hour commutes across the Bay Bridge aren't worrisome enough, the city at the heart of the global tech revolution is now at the breaking point - and bracing for another wave of wealth to hit. With Bay Area-based tech companies scheduled to hold initial public offerings this year, the city of instant millionaires is about to have thousands of even newer millionaires. And many residents of this city - secretly and not-so-secretly - fear that 2019 is the year San Francisco becomes a truly impossible place to live. </p><p>Initial public offerings should be causes for celebration, and not just for those ringing the bell at the stock exchange. These public and soon- to-be-public companies - the likes of which include Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest, Uber  and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. , a San Francisco stalwart founded during a different Gold Rush - will allow everyday investors across the country (finally!) to partake in the fruits of a decade of consumer Internet innovation. Similarly, universities, pension funds and nonprofits will see windfalls that will underwrite important work across the country.</p><p>But most of the initial employees and early investors in these unicorns live here in San Francisco, one of the most densely populated metropolitan areas in the United States. In the months after these companies go public, it will be fair to ask: How much wealth can one city take?</p><p>You could say this crisis isn't San Francisco's fault, at least not entirely. It didn't anticipate the smartphone, the app store or the consumer Internet revolution that made San Francisco a magnet for young people seeking burritos and taxis at 3 a.m. It wasn't prepared for global interest rates to hit record lows and remain there, making late-stage venture capital a lucrative asset class where companies could stay private longer, raising funds not from public markets but from individual and institutional investors. It didn't anticipate the worst recession since the Great Depression and the surge of excess labor to power the gig economy. Nor did it notice the emergence of cloud computing that made start-ups easier to launch from a studio apartment rather than a suburban garage. </p><p>But it did adopt - and then cling to - closed-minded housing policies for decades, stunting construction and stifling growth even as repeated waves of young people poured into the Bay Area over the past 20 years to build the next big thing. San Francisco, very literally, wasn't built (or zoned) for this many people or this much good fortune.</p><p>A family of four making nearly $120,000 in San Francisco is now considered low-income by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. According to a recent report from rental website Zumper, the median market monthly rent for a one-bedroom here has hit an all-time high of $3,690 - nearly $45,000 a year. There are multiple social-impact start-ups, such as Landed, helping the underpaid and underappreciated - like teachers and nurses - afford housing in the region.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you're looking to buy a single-family home, good luck: Although there are  about 100,000 vacant homes in San Francisco and neighboring communities, many aren't for sale; some have been bought, likely as an investment, and simply left empty. (It isn't uncommon to find apartment buildings here that are one-fourth to one-half empty, an experience that is a little eerie, not to mention inefficient.) Those with the means to buy a home in these parts will find it challenging to lock one down, and the most-discussed topic among young people is: Will I ever be able to afford the apartment I am renting?</p><p> The irony of this extreme concentration of wealth is that tech was supposed to solve this problem and allow people to innovate anywhere. Instead, this super-concentration of new wealth is likely to push talented people and their employers out of the area in search of more sustainable lifestyles - meaning the wealth is pushing people out of San Francisco, not the democratization of tech. It will also ensure that bashing tech companies is going to be the safest political sport for politicians in the months leading up to the 2020 election. Candidates on both the left and right will lift a page from the early-20th- century election playbook, when Standard Oil was depicted as an octopus, dexterous enough to parry Republicans and Democrats. </p><p>No one's weeping for big tech, but the war on Silicon Valley won't solve the region's housing crisis, either. And regulation won't stop a financial culture that will continue to mint more unicorns and, thus, more Bay Area millionaires. We can only hope that a crisis of wealth will lead to better housing policy in the United States' tech capital, and that some of tech's victors will make an exit from this lavish party and take their wealth, their angel investments, their networks and their knowledge to communities outside a fatigued city that simply wasn't prepared for this Big One to hit. </p><p>The writer is a venture capitalist at General Catalyst in San Francisco.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-9c0164605a3a11e9a00e050dc7b82693</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVH-PWG1-DYX1-H3N9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"971\"/><timeReceived>12:12 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0001TXN</classCode><className>LEVI STRAUSS &amp;

Onlookers stared at a temporary stage decked out with a banner that read, \"Celebrating 20 Years of Salesforce!\" Onstage, flanked by backup dancers, stood a man dressed in a full black suit singing a familiar tune:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They can't, they won't, they never will stop the party.\"</p><p>\"Is this Pitbull?\" I asked a middle-aged man in a corporate-branded Patagonia vest.</p><p>He just nodded as he stared ahead.</p><p>\"Y'all having a good time out there?\" Pitbull asked to silence. </p><p>A good time shouldn't be hard to come by in San Francisco, but don't blame us for being antsy. If $24 lunch salads, multiplying tent cities and two-hour commutes across the Bay Bridge aren't worrisome enough, the city at the heart of the global tech revolution is now at the breaking point - and bracing for another wave of wealth to hit. With Bay Area-based tech companies scheduled to hold initial public offerings this year, the city of instant millionaires is about to have thousands of even newer millionaires. And many residents of this city - secretly and not-so-secretly - fear that 2019 is the year San Francisco becomes a truly impossible place to live. </p><p>Initial public offerings should be causes for celebration, and not just for those ringing the bell at the stock exchange. These public and soon- to-be-public companies - the likes of which include Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest, Uber  and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. , a San Francisco stalwart founded during a different Gold Rush - will allow everyday investors across the country (finally!) to partake in the fruits of a decade of consumer Internet innovation. Similarly, universities, pension funds and nonprofits will see windfalls that will underwrite important work across the country.</p><p>But most of the initial employees and early investors in these unicorns live here in San Francisco, one of the most densely populated metropolitan areas in the United States. In the months after these companies go public, it will be fair to ask: How much wealth can one city take?</p><p>You could say this crisis isn't San Francisco's fault, at least not entirely. It didn't anticipate the smartphone, the app store or the consumer Internet revolution that made San Francisco a magnet for young people seeking burritos and taxis at 3 a.m. It wasn't prepared for global interest rates to hit record lows and remain there, making late-stage venture capital a lucrative asset class where companies could stay private longer, raising funds not from public markets but from individual and institutional investors. It didn't anticipate the worst recession since the Great Depression and the surge of excess labor to power the gig economy. Nor did it notice the emergence of cloud computing that made start-ups easier to launch from a studio apartment rather than a suburban garage. </p><p>But it did adopt - and then cling to - closed-minded housing policies for decades, stunting construction and stifling growth even as repeated waves of young people poured into the Bay Area over the past 20 years to build the next big thing. San Francisco, very literally, wasn't built (or zoned) for this many people or this much good fortune.</p><p>A family of four making nearly $120,000 in San Francisco is now considered low-income by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. According to a recent report from rental website Zumper, the median market monthly rent for a one-bedroom here has hit an all-time high of $3,690 - nearly $45,000 a year. There are multiple social-impact start-ups, such as Landed, helping the underpaid and underappreciated - like teachers and nurses - afford housing in the region.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you're looking to buy a single-family home, good luck: Although there are  about 100,000 vacant homes in San Francisco and neighboring communities, many aren't for sale; some have been bought, likely as an investment, and simply left empty. (It isn't uncommon to find apartment buildings here that are one-fourth to one-half empty, an experience that is a little eerie, not to mention inefficient.) Those with the means to buy a home in these parts will find it challenging to lock one down, and the most-discussed topic among young people is: Will I ever be able to afford the apartment I am renting?</p><p>The irony of this extreme concentration of wealth is that tech was supposed to solve this problem and allow people to innovate anywhere. Instead, this super-concentration of new wealth is likely to push talented people and their employers out of the area in search of more sustainable lifestyles - meaning the wealth is pushing people out of San Francisco, not the democratization of tech. It will also ensure that bashing tech companies is going to be the safest political sport for politicians in the months leading up to the 2020 election. Candidates on both the left and right will lift a page from the early-20th- century election playbook, when Standard Oil was depicted as an octopus, dexterous enough to parry Republicans and Democrats.</p><p>No one's weeping for big tech, but the war on Silicon Valley won't solve the region's housing crisis, either. And regulation won't stop a financial culture that will continue to mint more unicorns and, thus, more Bay Area millionaires. We can only hope that a crisis of wealth will lead to better housing policy in the United States' tech capital, and that some of tech's victors will make an exit from this lavish party and take their wealth, their angel investments, their networks and their knowledge to communities outside a fatigued city that simply wasn't prepared for this Big One to hit.</p><p>The writer is a venture capitalist at General Catalyst in San Francisco.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-9c016460-5a3a-11e9-a00e-050dc7b82693</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVH-VYW1-JBFW-C285-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"970\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0001TXN</classCode><className>LEVI STRAUSS &amp;

After tax credits, Facebook's final bill will actually be 7.4m, which equates to less than 1% of their overall sales. A Backlash against Big TechAs more and more high street retailers collapse, controversy continues to rage over whether this is the fault of the US tech giants, or merely a symptom of changing shopping habits. Labour MP and former chairman of the public accounts committee, Margaret Hodge, was one of several prominent officials who vented their indignation at Facebook's recent tax bill. </p><p>How Will the Proposed Tax Reforms Work?Currently, there are several plans afoot to tax big tech. Austria, which holds the rotating six-month presidency of the EU, is spearheading a plan for an interim tax of three per cent on the revenues from digital activities of large companies which have a global annual turnover of 750 million euros and EU revenue of at least 50 million euros. 'Internet giants currently aren't fairly taxed in Europe,' Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told journalists in Brussels. 'We support the commission's proposal and demand the introduction of an EU digital tax for internet giants.' Under the proposal, known as 'Fair Taxation of the Digital Economy[1]', some 200 companies would fall within the scope, netting some 5 billion Euros of tax. The proposal suggests that by current standards digital companies face an average tax rate of around 9.5%, compared with a 23.2% for bricks and mortar businesses.Autumn Budget Announces a UK Specific Digital Services TaxSpeaking at this week's autumn budget, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond announced plans for the UK to pursue its own digital sales tax, should there be failure to reach international agreement over a global tax. Hammond's version would tax tech companies with a turnover of more than 500m a levvy of 2% from April 2020. Focussed on search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces, the tax differs from the EU model by not including businesses that sell data. Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Tom Watson responded by saying: 'The measure announced today is pittance for these massive international companies..The new tax isn't even set to be implemented until 2020 at which time the tech giants will start to enjoy a 2% cut in their corporation tax rate. The lack of ambition in this announcement is derisory.'How Much Would Big Tech Have to Pay in the UK?We've looked over last years tax figures to calculate a rough estimate of what such a tax might raise for HM and Revenue. According to our figures, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple. Ebay and Twitter would have contributed just over 409 million in 2017 to the economy. How Tech Giants Exploit the 'Double Irish' Tax LoopholeUnder current tax laws, every subsidiary of a corporation settles its own tax bill separately and every subsidiary is entitled to buy and sell to each other. Facebook, as an example, bills UK advertising customers via Facebook Ireland Ltd which then makes payments to Facebook's parent company in the US and royalty payments to Facebook Ireland Holding with the result that it declares little profit. While Facebook Ireland Holdings has a presence in Ireland, it's actual tax domicile is in the Cayman Islands, which is tax-free. And since non Irish companies do not have to declare public accounts, the buck stops there. Tax Experts call this trick the 'double Irish.' Google used a similar trick moving some \u20ac15.9bn euros (14.1bn) to a Bermuda shell company in 2016, thereby saving themselves 3bn in taxes. Their strategy, known as a 'double Irish with a Dutch sandwich' involves moving revenue from an Irish subsidiary to a Dutch company (with zero) employees, and subsequently on to a Bermuda mailbox owned by another Ireland-registered company.From Double Dutch to Single MaltWhile Ireland has now closed the tax loophole that allows the 'double Irish', companies already using the structure are allowed to continue employing it until the end of 2020. In the meantime, a new loophole known as the 'single malt is gaining in popularity. This entails directing profits to countries with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement but which do not have any corporation tax such as Malta or UAE.Are their downsides to a Potential Big Tech Tax?By taxing companies on a percentage of revenue, there is always the possibility that a company with a high turnover, despite making no profit, might be taxed unfairly. 'A digital services tax deviates from fundamental principles of income taxation by applying the tax on gross income, i.e. without regard to whether the taxpayer is making a profit or not' commented Swedish Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson, and her counterparts from Denmark and Finland, Kristian Jensen and Petteri Orpo in a joint statement on EuObserver[2].Will the GAFA Tax Further Strain Trans-Atlantic TensionsFor many, the greatest risk of an EU-wide tax is rather the risk of American backlash. Washington has already called the proposed tax an act of aggression against its tech industry and rolled out a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tax on imports of aluminum, following it up with a tweet the next day which said 'Trade wars are good, and easy to win.' With France and Germany now offering their public support to back Austrian efforts to have all 28 EU member nations approve the tax, it seems increasingly likely the tax will pass. In the meantime, US media responses to Philip Hammond's UK based tax suggest the Americans are likely to react with hostility. 'If the United Kingdom or other countries proceed, that will prompt a review of our US tax and regulatory approach to determine what actions are appropriate to ensure a level playing field in global markets,' said Kevin Brady,U.S. Representative for Texas's 8th congressional district.

It planted the seed for Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company by 2000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract awarded by the Pentagon sends a message to companies and governments around the world about the profound change in how all technology runs.</p><p>The organisation at the core of the world's largest military industrial complex knows the cloud will put the most sophisticated war waging capabilities within reach of every soldier.</p><p>Winning the contract sends a message to sceptics in the cloud computing world that Microsoft's cloud capabilities, which include 54 data centres around the world, are as good as those of Amazon Web Services, which is three times its size.</p><p>Finally, the JEDI contract should remove once and for all the nervousness that still pervades many companies and government departments and agencies about security in the cloud. Microsoft has 3500 cyber-security engineers and invests $US1 billion a year in cyber security.</p><p>In the three weeks since the Pentagon made its controversial decision, the Jeff Bezos-owned Amazon Web Services has had a dummy spit and Microsoft's sharemarket value has risen by about $US50 billion to $US1.14 trillion.</p><p>Both Amazon, which says it will sue the government to have the JEDI deal overturned, and financial markets have clearly recognised the importance of the deal and its longer-term ramifications.</p><p>In many ways the JEDI contract, which runs for 10 years, is the ultimate rolled gold stamp of approval for Nadella's decision to shift Microsoft's strategic direction towards hyper-scale cloud computing, under the banner of Azure.</p><p>Not that he needed confirmation of his brilliance. Since he took over as chief executive in February 2014, Microsoft's stock price has risen fourfold, adding about $US850 billion in value.</p><p>At first, Nadella's move into the cloud was a worry to a Microsoft board of directors used to thinking about the world as Bill Gates did, with a PC on every desk running proprietary software that was updated every three years.</p><p>The company was used to earning profit margins of 90 per cent.</p><p>But as revenues grew his vision was recognised. The growth in the volume of new business has compensated for the fall in margins to about 63 per cent.</p><p>Nadella prioritised the Azure cloud business before he became CEO. When he took over from Steve Ballmer in February 2014, he set out to change the Microsoft culture. This multi-year task is well described in his 2017 book, Hit Refresh.</p><p>Microsoft has positioned itself as a friend of software developers. Nadella pulled down the company's walled-garden approach to software development and embraced open source coding.</p><p>The company is the world's strongest supporter of the Linux open source coding system and its purchase of GitHub for $US7.6 billion in 2018 gave it access to 36 million open source software developers.</p><p>Nadella recognised early on that everything would become digital and all software applications could live either in the cloud or on local servers controlled by customers.</p><p>About three years ago, Microsoft's software engineers broke everything in the company's suite of products into modular applications. Instead of offering customers monolithic systems that take years to embed and always cost more than expected, Nadella rebuilt everything on Azure, so customers can pick and choose and mix and match.</p><p>He had the insight to recognise Microsoft's foundations as a provider of productivity tools for large enterprises through the Office product set could be the springboard for turning the company into the platform for digitisation of just about any task in any industry.</p><p>It is this digitisation of everything that makes Hamish Douglass, chairman and chief investment officer at Magellan Financial Group, believe that Microsoft is only at the very beginning of its cloud-driven expansion.</p><p>\"I think of the cloud as a platform,\" he says. \"When we move to the Internet of Things, businesses and government departments are going to start digitising processes and moving those processes to the cloud, and then start processing the data with machine learning and AI.</p><p>\"I think they're building an entire platform for digitising the enterprise. They are developing their own productivity software through Dynamics and Office, but also I think they want to be hosting other people's software,\" Douglass says.</p><p>\"Who knows what software's going to be written in the next 10 to 20 years? There's going to be the digitisation of health services, the taxation department, manufacturing processes and all the smart things through the Internet of Things.</p><p>\"I think because they're an enterprise company and they have all these components, they're so well positioned.</p><p>\"The commercial cloud business is already growing at 30 per cent a year and they haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of this.</p><p>\"This business has come from nowhere 10 years ago to $US40 billion a year. We're talking about a market that's going to be in the trillions of dollars of addressable market,\" Douglass adds.</p><p>Magellan owns $3.1 billion in Microsoft shares as part of its global equities strategy. Douglass says he first bought the shares in 2013 when the stock was $US28 a share and the market thought \"Windows was dead\".</p><p>Nadella says every company is now a technology company and the next big technology breakthroughs will come \"not only from technology companies, but from retailers, healthcare providers and manufacturers, working in partnership with us\".</p><p>\"It's fantastic to see this in action in Australia, where we're partnering with leaders in every industry and across the public sector to apply technology to address some of their biggest challenges - from improving healthcare outcomes and optimising employee training to empowering first-line workers,\" he says.</p><p>Amazon had a four-year head start on Microsoft in cloud computing but Nadella came to the market with a bold growth target of creating a $US20 billion a year business by 2018. This stretch target was sold to Wall Street by chief financial officer Amy Hood, who has all the hallmarks of being the next CEO of Microsoft whenever Nadella chooses to depart.</p><p>She has brought stringent discipline to Microsoft's business fundamentals and a laser-like focus on the entire expenses line. Most divisions have flat budgets and must get expansion capital from transformation benefits.</p><p>Amazon still dominates cloud computing with a market share of 48 per cent, according to Gartner. But Microsoft is rapidly catching up.</p><p>In the year to June the Azure cloud business grew by 63 per cent and its market share rose to 15.5 per cent, while Amazon's share went backwards. Microsoft has more than doubled its market share since 2015.</p><p>The narrowing gap in market share partly explains why Amazon is so angry about losing the JEDI contract. It has accused the US government of \"unmistakable bias\" and is readying a court challenge. It will be fascinating to see whether Bezos, the publisher of The Washington Post, can prove President Donald Trump was involved in the decision.</p><p>Is it no surprise cloud momentum is with the company with the JEDI contract, considering Microsoft's co-founder Paul Allen built a pop culture museum in Microsoft's home town, Seattle. It is full of Star Wars memorabilia, including Luke Skywalker's lightsaber.</p><p>The JEDI contract is significant from multiple perspectives, according to Microsoft president Brad Smith. During an interview with The Australian Financial Review in his office at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington, he hints it will have ramifications for US military allies such as Australia.</p><p>\"I think if this contract were awarded in 2016, or maybe even 2017, it more likely would have gone in another direction because Azure was not as full-featured as it is today,\" he says. \"And so it just reflects the incredible investment we made in innovation, especially with an eye towards meeting the needs of large customers like the Department of Defence.</p><p>\"I think it is a reflection, second, of the degree to which the world is embracing the cloud. In part, the clear philosophy of the Pentagon is they need to move faster to get to the cloud, because that's where the future is, and they can't expect to be the leading military force in the world if they're not using the cloud. I think that is a lesson that speaks not only to the military forces of the world, but fundamentally to every type of institution in the world.</p><p>\"And so, yes, I think that we may well see this speak to people in other industries, or areas of government, as well.</p><p>\"Third, you know, every contract is important, but some contracts are more important than others, and you know this award is not just a contract, it's a responsibility, you know, and it creates for Microsoft a very important responsibility for the defence of the United States, and fundamentally the protection of the American people,\" Smith continues.</p><p>\"And, yes, I think the single most important thing that we do, as a company, is act with the acute appreciation of the responsibility that creates for us.</p><p>\"As we do that, you know, I think that it is an opportunity, almost by definition, to connect with the other governments and military forces that are close allies to the United States. I think that, again, that takes us to the other four of the Five Eyes, and to the 26 other NATO members, in particular.</p><p>\"And so I think this is a contract that's going to have multiple ramifications over many years, for the role that we need to play in many parts of the world.\"</p><p>There are many aspects to the brilliance of Nadella's strategic shift to the cloud, not the least of which was his decision to use Microsoft as a test bed for a corporate transformation.</p><p>After all, how can you possibly convince your customers of the merits of tech transformation tools if you have not used them yourself?</p><p>Microsoft's chief digital officer and executive vice-president corporate strategy and operations, Kurt DelBene, tells the Financial Review Nadella recognised early on that the old way of running IT was broken and would not enable companies to transform themselves at the pace required in a digital age. \"Two and a half years ago, Satya was really saying, 'We're seeing all this transformation that happens in our customer base or that they want to know what transformation needs.They have an inkling that the way they do IT today is not going to survive,' \" DelBene says.</p><p>\"It's just the wrong way to think about it. Essentially, speccing out a system that you need, based on your people inside the organisation, saying, 'I need you to deliver these features.'</p><p>\"And you then go to somebody like Accenture, and say, 'Deliver me these features', and then they run it, and with no real insight as to what the business processes are and how those are going to change over a period of time, or need to change over a period of time to get where you need to go.</p><p>\"And so, I think what's put a head on that is this recognition by all industries that digitisation - or this tech intensity, as Satya talked about it - this need to have technology, software, services be a core part of your business, moving forward, is exploding.\"</p><p>Nadella gave DelBene the task of transforming Microsoft's approach to managing IT. He knew the job was in good hands because DelBene had just spent seven months fixing healthcare.gov for president Barack Obama.</p><p>\"We were two-thirds out outsourced, so we did the thing that everybody did of listening to constituents and then just parrot it back and say, 'Build us this',\" DelBene says.</p><p>\"We did not have a deep technical bench, in terms of people being able to really envision what the software can do, and then actually code it. We basically ran the systems that we specced and had delivered.\"</p><p>DelBene says Microsoft's transformation resulted in huge costs savings from in-sourcing software development.</p><p>\"We're about two-thirds in-sourced now,\" he says. \"We've massively reduced our outsourcing dependency, as a result, in hundreds of millions of dollars. We have moved 95 per cent of our systems to the cloud. We have a vision for every one of our product areas in concert with the stakeholders.\"</p><p>During its transformation, Microsoft moved to what DelBene calls a \"DevOps\" model, which means the developers who wrote the code also operate the system they wrote the code for.</p><p>Under Nadella's leadership, Microsoft has married the perpetual software licensing approach in Microsoft's Office 365 products with the perpetual licensing that comes with cloud infrastructure.</p><p>DelBene says Nadella's \"superpower\" is in \"envisioning where the industry's going, envisioning products, stitching together different patterns into new products\".</p><p>Nadella sees patterns in the way customers are using products and responds by directing software development resources to these areas.</p><p>Microsoft's business is broken down into three segments: productivity and business processes, which includes Office 365, LinkedIn and Dynamics 365; intelligent cloud, which includes server products and cloud services; and more personal computing, which includes Windows, Bing, Xbox and Surface computer devices.</p><p>No other company offers under one roof computing as a service, storage, productivity apps, front-office apps, core financials, data analytics, identity security, artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p><p>As Microsoft grows more powerful and its services and products become more pervasive across business and government, it is bound to catch the attention of regulators.</p><p>This is already happening, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week warning of potential \"sovereignty\" issues from the storage of data on Microsoft servers, even though they are located in Germany.</p><p>The Financial Times reported last week that Merkel told a union conference: \"So many companies have just outsourced all their data to US companies. I'm not saying that's bad in and of itself - I just mean that the value-added products that come out of that, with the help of artificial intelligence, will create dependencies that I'm not sure are a good thing.\"</p><p>There is no doubt that whatever concerns Merkel has will be addressed in fulsome detail by Smith, who is sometimes referred to as the US secretary of state for tech.</p><p>It his consummate management of regulatory issues that is largely responsible for Microsoft avoiding the intense political scrutiny and public opprobrium directed at Facebook, Google and Twitter.</p><p>Rod Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, says Microsoft was not like the new digital platform companies such as Facebook and Google, which he says have never taken responsibility for what happens on their platforms. \"Facebook and Google say, 'we are just a platform, just like Airbnb', whereas the larger tech companies like Microsoft have never had that approach,\" he says. \"They are a company doing business in a way companies do. They take a broader approach. They can see they have got to get ahead of these things.</p><p>\"I think Microsoft is a company that understands responsibility because they have been a broad business enterprise.\"</p><p>Smith, who is also Microsoft's chief legal officer, has taken a proactive stance across all the big tech debates including privacy, the digital divide and artificial intelligence.</p><p>A company once labelled \"the Evil Empire\" and at the forefront of attempts by anti-trust regulators in the US to be broken apart 20 years ago is largely missing from US congressional committee meetings.</p><p>Smith made sure Microsoft leads from the front on just about every contentious regulatory issue. For example, Microsoft voluntarily adopted Europe's General Data Protection Regulation privacy rules across all its products worldwide.</p><p>It was Smith who made sure Microsoft sent a senior executive from head office to Australia when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called a meeting of tech executives earlier this year in the wake of the Christchurch mosque shootings. Facebook and Google sent local representatives who could not speak on behalf of head office and were therefore berated by Morrison.</p><p>Smith wrote a book with Carol Ann Browne called Tools and Weapons.

The digital revolution now threatens to undermine values that it was supposed to advance\u2014personal freedom, democracy, trustworthy knowledge, even open competition. It isn't as though the technology did this to us on its own, or that we stumbled absentmindedly into an alternative dystopian universe. Today's technological regime grew out of critical choices to ignore lessons of the past and allow private power to go unregulated.Three problems\u2014monopoly, surveillance, and disinformation\u2014sum up what's gone wrong and what needs to be fought and fixed in order to have any hope of recovering the promise of the new technology.The explosive growth of the online economy in the 1990s and early 2000s appeared to validate the idea that markets were best left to themselves. </p><p>The internet of that era was neoliberalism's greatest triumph. After the federal government financed key breakthroughs and then opened the internet to commercial development, digital innovation and entrepreneurship created new online means of exchange, new wealth, and new communities. But that online economy now looks altogether different with the rise of platform monopolies. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft control whole ecosystems of the digital world, dominating key choke points for commerce and news.Just as the early internet fostered the illusion that it was inherently supportive of competition, so it fostered the illusion that it was inherently protective of personal autonomy. After all, no one compelled you to disclose your true identity online. Yet the digital world today has made possible the most comprehensive system of surveillance ever created; networked devices track our every movement and communication. A new form of enterprise has emerged that Shoshana Zuboff calls 'surveillance capitalism,' as Google, Facebook, and other firms sweep up data about our lives, preferences, personalities, and emotions 'for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales.'The digital revolution began under the state, moved to the market, and now illustrates what goes wrong when the dominant players are unrestrained by law. The reality has turned out to be less benign. The online economy has destroyed the traditional business model of journalism, resulting in a dramatic decline in professional reporting. And because Google and Facebook dominate digital advertising, no alternative online model has emerged capable of financing the same reporting capacities, particularly at the regional and local level. Meanwhile, social media platforms have replaced the old mass media gatekeepers, shaping the public's exposure to news and debate through their algorithms. Those algorithms\u2014for example, in Facebook's news feed, Google's search and YouTube recommendation engine, and Twitter's trending topics\u2014now influence which content and viewpoints gain visibility among users. Instead of promoting better-informed public debate, however, social media have become powerful vectors of disinformation, polarization, and hatred.These problems afflict other countries as well as the United States, but the digital economy has been a distinctly American development. How we arrived at the present crisis and what we can do about it have become urgent political questions. The Neoliberal Turn The growth of the internet and digital economy has been a paradigmatic story of American technology since the Cold War. The digital revolution began under the aegis of the state, moved to the market, and has now become an illustration of all that has gone wrong when the dominant players in markets are unrestrained by law.From the 1940s to the early 1970s, the federal government financed and guided most of the development of computers and electronic communication, largely via the Defense Department. It was a Defense office, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, that funded and supervised the creation of ARPANET, the forerunner to the internet.During the mid-20th century, the United States also extensively regulated telecommunications. While AT...ad an effective monopoly, regulatory policies constrained telephone rates, promoted universal service, and barred discrimination, requiring telecom companies to act as common carriers. Because of its treatment of capital investment, the regulatory system gave AT...n incentive to devote ample funds to research, and its research arm, Bell Labs, produced an extraordinary array of advances, including data networking, the transistor, the laser, and cellular telephony. Bell's advances were subject to compulsory licensing[1], which meant they were available for others to build on.Thanks to this mixed economy, the computing and telecommunications industries in the United States developed an enormous lead over their counterparts in other countries, the source of America's head start and comparative advantage in digital innovation. Later on, the myth would develop that individual geniuses working in garages gave us computers and the internet. But their work would not have been possible without the investments and technical advances that the federal government and regulated telecom industry had already made.Nonetheless, the telecom regulatory regime had a serious downside. It gave AT...he power to control every aspect of the telephone network, including what devices could connect to it. Like any monopoly, AT...ought to protect its privileged position. After the Defense Department received a proposal in 1964 for a communication network similar to the internet, an AT...xecutive said, 'Damned if we are going to allow the creation of a competitor to ourselves.' The law at that point was on AT... side.The federal government's involvement in computers and telecommunications began to decline, however, in the late 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the general neoliberal shift in national policy. Here I am using the term 'neoliberal' specifically to refer to ideas and policies that seek to create markets and rely on market forces. The neoliberal arsenal includes such measures as privatization, free-trade agreements, deregulation, tax cuts, and reductions in social spending. What distinguishes neoliberalism from 19th-century laissez-faire is that it has arisen after a period of liberal and social democratic state-building. In the standard history, neoliberalism owes its philosophical origins to Friedrich Hayek and his circle in the 1940s and emerged as a political force with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the late 1970s and 1980s.Politically, however, deregulation differed from other market-oriented measures. Some forms of deregulation attracted support from prominent liberals and progressives\u2014including Senator Ted Kennedy and Ralph Nader\u2014on the grounds that the regulatory agencies had been captured by the industries they were supposed to regulate and were no longer serving the public. Limiting AT... power enjoyed support across the ideological spectrum.Although the big step would come in 1984, when a court broke up AT...the federal government had already begun loosening the telephone monopoly by that time. In cases in 1956 and 1968, federal authorities reduced AT... control over devices attached to the telephone network. These early deregulatory steps, together with the subsequent development of microcomputers, opened the way for consumers and businesses in the late 1970s and '80s to obtain modems (enabling computers to talk to each other) and dial-up access to early online bulletin boards and proprietary networks.Those proprietary networks\u2014the 'big three' were CompuServe, the original leader in the 1980s; America Online (AOL), which grew rapidly in the early '90s; and Prodigy\u2014looked for a time as though they would dominate 'computer information services.' Each company had its own distinct news sources, discussion groups, email systems, and rules (for example, AOL restricted its forums to no more than 23 people, effectively limiting the reach of any individual user). At the time, it was by no means obvious that the internet\u2014originally limited to government use, then expanded to universities and research institutes\u2014would emerge as the framework for electronic communication.But the internet had a more open architecture, including a design principle known as 'end-to-end' that distinguished it from other networks. As Lawrence Lessig explained[2] it in these pages in 2001, 'This model regulates where 'intelligence' in a network is placed. It counsels that intelligence be placed in the applications'\u2014that is, among the users at either end of the network, rather than in the center with the network manager. As a result, unlike the proprietary networks, the internet was permission-free: It invited and decentralized innovation.Opening up the internet to wider access, including commercial development, was therefore simultaneously a move toward the market and away from proprietary control of the network itself. That was what happened in the first half of the 1990s, when rules against commercial use of the internet were dropped, the internet 'backbone' was privatized, and a host of new applications were created, including the World Wide Web. Much of this new software was also developed on a nonproprietary, open-source basis, though that did not reflect any legal or technical requirement (indeed, a new architecture of control could be built on top of the internet, which is what the online platforms would eventually do).The politics of internet policy in the 1990s were less ideological than generational. In 1992, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore championed the development of a new 'information superhighway,' they were signaling a generational change in national leadership. As a senator, Gore had done more than anyone else in national politics to open up and expand the internet.National policy during the Clinton administration steered clear of any regulation of the emerging online economy. Internet service providers were even subsidized by being exempted from network access charges, and internet intermediaries received broad immunity from liability for user-generated content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, adopted as part of general telecommunications legislation in 1996. The best approach to policy, according to William Kennard[3], a chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) appointed by Clinton, was to allow the 'marketplace to find business solutions as an alternative to intervention by government.'That general attitude continued to dominate policy toward the internet under George W. Bush and Barack Obama. While Republicans opposed a broader role for government in general, Democrats opposed it for the internet and the tech industry in particular. The internet had flourished seemingly without government: Why risk endangering it? Those early beliefs about the internet\u2014in line with general neoliberal premises at the time\u2014left both policymakers and the public unprepared for the rise of platform monopolies and surveillance capitalism, the devastation to professional journalism, and the use of digital communications for disinformation.If the internet had emerged in a different period, it might have developed differently. But the online economy has developed in an era when the three chief means of keeping corporate power in check\u2014antitrust, economic regulation, and public ownership\u2014have all been in retreat. The federal government did bring one important antitrust suit when it sought to break up Microsoft during the 1990s, a case that finally ended with a consent decree in 2002 and probably prevented Microsoft from squashing Google in its infancy.Since then, however, the government has raised no obstacles as online platform companies have expanded, bought out potential rivals, and gained monopoly power. Nor has the government raised any obstacles to the platforms' accumulation of personal data; unlike the European Union, Congress has enacted no general legislation protecting consumer privacy online. And despite the collapse of journalism, America has been unwilling to consider the level of support for public media widely accepted in many other liberal democracies. Only in the last few years has serious attention focused on changes needed to deal with the new concentrations of unaccountable power. Taking On Monopoly This is not the first time that a communications revolution has seen a rapid turn from wide-open competition to concentrated control. The same thing happened with the telegraph between the 1840s and 1860s, when Western Union gained a monopoly. It happened again with the telephone between the mid-1890s and 1910s, when AT...ook over the industry. And it happened a third time with radio from the early to the late 1920s, when NBC and CBS became the dominant national networks. That monopolies would arise yet again should have surprised nobody. Although the internet changed many things, it did not change the tendency toward monopoly in network communications.The internet's effect on economic concentration, however, may be even greater than the effects of the earlier communications media. Today, Amazon alone has nearly half of online sales, Google and Facebook are taking virtually all the growth in digital advertising, and venture capitalists hesitate to fund some new startups because the big tech companies can so easily drive them under. Instead of diffusing wealth, the digital revolution has been concentrating it in a few giant tech firms and their shareholders.Antitrust and regulatory policies might have limited the growth of monopolies and abuses of market power. But since the 1980s, the federal government has greatly relaxed antitrust enforcement against big corporations, thanks to the influence of theories holding that corporate dominance of a market is no problem if it improves 'consumer welfare,' interpreted largely to mean lower consumer prices. That criterion has made it difficult to prosecute antitrust cases against companies like Facebook and Google, which rely on advertising and user-generated content and charge consumers nothing, or against Amazon, which has sacrificed profits for market domination. Federal authorities have waved through mergers such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, even though those mergers reduce consumers' leverage in the marketplace (for example, on privacy policies), and reinforce the monopoly power of the platform giants.During the struggles against monopoly power in the railroads and other industries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Congress and the courts took steps not only against horizontal mergers but also against predatory pricing (cutting prices below costs to drive out competitors), price discrimination (varying prices to individual buyers or sellers according to their characteristics or circumstances), and vertical integration (combining stages of production or distribution normally operated as separate businesses).In recent decades, however, the courts have tended to dismiss these concerns, failing to anticipate the new potential for monopoly power in digital platforms, which benefit from network effects. The larger a network grows, the more valuable it becomes to each participant it connects and, conversely, the greater the cost of being excluded. As that cost of exclusion[4] rises, so does the market power of a platform company. In the digital world, scale also brings the capacity to extract data from users to train systems of machine intelligence; only the largest companies can compete effectively.Platformmonopolies pose a new threat. Because of the high cost of exclusion from its marketplace, Amazon has other sellers at its mercy. A platform market like Amazon, Lina Khan argues in the Yale Law Journal[5], has clear incentives to pursue growth over short-term profits, a strategy rewarded by investors that makes predatory pricing 'highly rational\u2014even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.' Amazon's sky-high market capitalization testifies to that logic. (Enjoy that free delivery for Amazon Prime while you can!) The size of Amazon Marketplace makes it essential for other sellers, even though by participating in it, they provide Amazon with critical data, which it sometimes uses to swoop in and undersell them with its own branded versions of their most lucrative products. As a result of the high cost of exclusion from its marketplace, Amazon has other sellers at its mercy and can impose onerous terms on them.So how to limit the power of market-dominant platforms? Senator Elizabeth Warren proposes to do two things[6]. As president, she would appoint 'regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers' like Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, Google's acquisitions of Waze and DoubleClick, and Amazon's acquisitions of Whole Foods and Zappos. And she would seek legislation requiring the biggest tech platforms\u2014those with global revenues of $25 billion or more\u2014to be designated as 'platform utilities' and kept 'structurally separate' from businesses participating in the market. Amazon Marketplace, for example, would have to operate separately from Amazon's own sales. All platforms, above or below the $25 billion level, would have to meet a standard of 'fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users.'Antitrust investigations of big tech are already under way. The Justice Department Antitrust Division is investigating Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is handling Facebook and Amazon. State attorneys general are investigating Google and Facebook. But even under a President Warren, breaking up big tech might be difficult. Historically, such cases have typically dragged on for years, and the odds of success today are probably not high in view of prevailing judicial doctrine. Federal authorities may also be reluctant to break up American tech companies at a time when weakening them may indirectly strengthen their Chinese rivals.That's not to say the kind of structural change Warren calls for should be off the table. Reducing the market power of platform monopolies may get support from substantial segments of business, not just consumer groups. A new administration hoping to curb predatory pricing and other abuses of market power may have more success, however, going directly after those abuses through new legislation or existing regulatory authority. In fact, new federal legislation may now be likely in one area\u2014privacy rights\u2014though possibly not for good reasons. The Challenge of Surveillance Capitalism The United States has long been a laggard on data privacy. American law treats privacy mainly as an aspect of individual liberty threatened by the state, not by the market. Pressure from corporate interests has limited legal protections of personal data collected privately and exchanged in the marketplace. While federal law regulates data in some areas like credit reporting and health care, even those statutes mostly predate the rise of the internet. As a result, consumer privacy online has largely depended on corporate self-regulation, and the FTC has been able to act on privacy abuses chiefly when companies have violated their own privacy policies or otherwise deceived consumers.In contrast, European law has conceived of privacy as an aspect of human dignity threatened by intrusions of all kinds, private as well as governmental. Consistent with that tradition, the European Union has had stronger consumer data protections, a pattern that culminated in 2016 in the EU's adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). At least on its face, the GDPR requires companies to give consumers the right to control data gathered about them, potentially upending the business model that has turned Google and Facebook into behemoths.But the politics of data privacy may now have changed in the United States. The Cambridge Analytica scandal and a seemingly endless stream of disclosures about Facebook have helped raise awareness about the limits of corporate self-regulation. Last year, California adopted major new consumer privacy legislation, and several other states are considering bills. After long resisting a federal privacy law, corporate interests are now pushing for it[7] as a way of preempting stronger state measures.While scandals have provoked public outrage, the financial interests at stake have never been greater. Personal data is now the lifeblood of giant tech firms. Google and Facebook aggregate data from their own sites and other sources on individuals regardless of whether they have accounts with the companies. With that constant and comprehensive stream of data, they are able to target advertising more precisely and efficiently than the mass media.Some of this 'behavioral advertising' is harmless, and indeed many people may even like getting ads that are more 'personalized.' But personalization has rich possibilities for exploitation. In a guide for Australian and New Zealand advertisers, Facebook noted, 'By monitoring posts, pictures, interactions, and Internet activity, Facebook can work out when young people feel 'stressed,' 'defeated,' 'overwhelmed,' 'anxious,' 'nervous,' 'stupid,' 'silly,' 'useless,' and a 'failure''\u2014in short, the moments when they are 'most vulnerable to a specific configuration of advertising cues and nudges.' A Wall Street Journal investigation[8] of apps that send Facebook highly personal information found that one of them\u2014with 25 million downloads\u2014provided Facebook with estimates of when women were ovulating. Tracking users and stockpiling sensitive data about them inevitably risks abuses. (Facebook disowned responsibility for both the advertiser guide and the app once they were exposed.)One of the things that companies want most, as Phillip Longman explains[9] in the Washington Monthly, is to know the maximum price you'll pay for whatever they're selling, whether it's a ride on Uber or a product on Amazon\u2014and 'it's getting harder and harder to avoid dealing with marketers who can estimate with increasing accuracy just how much you, personally, are willing to pay, and who charge you accordingly.'In her book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Zuboff points out that the surveillance business is fundamentally about creating 'prediction products,' which are valuable not just to advertisers who want better predictions of what you'll buy and how much you'll pay. Insurance companies, landlords, and employers are also interested in more personalized predictions about potential policyholders, tenants, and workers.Moreover, surveillance capitalism has now moved from the virtual world into the physical one as our phones, apps, and networked devices in the 'internet of things' report back to the data companies where we are and what we are doing. The companies, Zuboff writes[10], want to 'nudge, tune, herd, manipulate, and modify behavior in specific directions by executing actions as subtle as inserting a specific phrase into your Facebook news feed, timing the appearance of a BUY button on your phone, or shutting down your car engine when an insurance payment is late.' If unregulated, the new technology has an awesome potential for a new social regime, operated in the interests of the dominant companies.Both the European GDPR and California's new privacy legislation aim to give consumers more control of their information, but they do it in different ways. The GDPR requires an opt-in, whereas the California law requires companies to give consumers an opt-out. Under the GDPR, companies must get individuals' consent for their data practices in a 'freely given, specific, plainly worded, and unambiguous[11]' agreement. Among the rights given to consumers are a right of access to information collected about them; a right of 'erasure' of data under certain circumstances (more qualified than the earlier 'right to be forgotten'); and a 'right of explanation' to algorithmic decisions about them. What these rights mean in practice will depend on regulatory and judicial decisions.The early results since the GDPR went into effect in 2018 have not been encouraging. Complying with the GDPR requires a significant investment. Those costs are not a problem for big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, which have been able to get consumers to click on consent forms, but the costs are a problem for small firms and startups. The GDPR could therefore end up strengthening the platform monopolies.In addition, the GDPR delegates regulatory enforcement to the country where a company has its principal facilities and 'data controller.' For the major American companies, that country is Ireland[12], which has long catered to the tech industry it is now supposed to regulate. Irish officials are now reaching closure on some major enforcement cases, and critics are skeptical about how rigorously they will interpret the GDPR. One key question is whether Facebook can require its users to consent to its data practices as a condition for using Facebook.Behavioral advertising may seem harmless, and some people may even likegetting 'personalized' ads. But it has rich possibilities for exploitation. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which goes into effect in January 2020, is not as broad as the GDPR and does not require consumer consent for companies to collect personal data. Instead, the CCPA[13] requires[14] large firms to post in a 'clear and conspicuous' place a simple and specific opt-out: 'Do Not Sell My Personal Information.' Since the law defines large firms as those that have annual revenues over $25 million or personal data on 50,000 or more individuals, it is unlikely to cause the perverse effects of the GDPR in strengthening big tech. The CCPA also explicitly gives consumers a right to receive equal service and pricing from a business regardless of whether they exercise that opt-out or other rights. And it defines 'selling' personal data broadly to include 'disclosing, disseminating, making available, [or] transferring' that data. The internet industry doggedly tried to amend the CCPA to get an exception for digital advertising, but they failed in the legislative session that ended in September.The California law effectively applies to large firms throughout the country, which are unlikely to deny everyone else rights they have to give Californians. Nonetheless, other states have been considering legislation as well. A proposed New York law[15], applicable to companies of any size, would go beyond California's in creating a private right of action, enabling consumers individually to sue companies for privacy infringements. It would also treat companies as 'data fiduciaries,' requiring them to act like other kinds of fiduciaries such as physicians and lawyers (who have to keep information confidential) and put the consumers' interests first.But a proliferation of state laws could boomerang. By exposing companies to conflicting requirements and the risk of being inundated with litigation, laws beyond California's would strengthen the case for federal legislation to override separate state rules, perhaps with much weaker national ones.Still, there is at least positive movement on privacy rights. Like antitrust, privacy law now provides a framework for reform that has considerable public legitimacy. The third challenge posed by the internet\u2014disinformation\u2014is much tougher, conceptually and politically. Disinformation and the Degradation of the News Two effects of the digital revolution have degraded the quality of news and information. American journalism has been in free fall as a result of the collapse of its traditional business model. About a fifth of local newspapers have closed, and many of the survivors are ghostly shadows of what they once were. Whole areas of the country have become news deserts, without any local reporting, leaving many people reliant on social media.But the social media platforms, freed from any accountability for user-generated content, have until recently had no incentive to invest resources to distinguish truth from falsehood, much less to block outright disinformation. They have even taken ads\u2014for example, from the Russians in 2016\u2014in the form of 'dark posts' in the news feeds of targeted groups, invisible to the public at large. The platforms' algorithms have been optimized to build scale and make the sites as 'sticky' and ultimately as profitable as possible. If conspiracy stories and other sensationalist and extreme content had that effect, it was of no concern to the platform companies. Google's YouTube\u2014which in late 2016 passed one billion viewing hours[16] a day, close to total viewing time for all television and growing more quickly\u2014has been a prime example of this pattern. A 2018 investigation[17] by The Wall Street Journal found that after detecting the political biases of users, YouTube typically fed them videos echoing 'those biases, often with more-extreme viewpoints.'For all the limitations of the predigital media, journalistic organizations at least traditionally accepted responsibility for the reliability of the news they transmitted. The digital revolution shifted power to social media platforms that have disclaimed any such responsibility. If reforms are to rectify that loss of responsible editorial judgment, they will have to do two things: first, help reconstitute the economic basis of professional journalism and, second, hold social media platforms accountable for their role in shaping exposure to different contents, sources, and viewpoints. Democratic government can and should play a role in the first; it is not clear how, if at all, it can play a role in the second, except by reducing platform monopolies and requiring some degree of transparency.Government support for journalism is widely regarded as anathema, but it shouldn't be. Many liberal democracies provide substantial financial support to journalism through mechanisms that protect the integrity of the press. The BBC has served as a model of tax-financed, public-service broadcasting, while the Scandinavian countries have subsidized newspapers without impairing press freedom. Early American democracy would not have had its vitality without the subsidies the government provided to the press through below-cost postal rates as well as printing contracts and other means.Since the late 1800s, however, American journalism has existed almost entirely on a commercial basis. Indeed, during the 20th century, newspapers and broadcast networks made so much money that the best of them amply cross-subsidized areas of coverage that could not have been justified as contributing to their financial bottom line. Now the profits are disappearing, but a majority of Americans have not registered the significance of the change. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center[18] in 2018, 71 percent think their local news media are doing well financially.Newspaper publishers would like to get some of the ad revenue now going to the platforms. They're supporting a bill that would give them a four-year exemption from antitrust laws to enable them to negotiate collectively with Google and Facebook. But even then, the news media would be in a weak bargaining position; they need the traffic from Google and Facebook more than the platforms need them. The antitrust exemption wouldn't resolve journalism's crisis.Coming up with reasonable proposals to support journalism is not the problem. One straightforward way would be an earmarked tax on digital platforms to support public-service journalism, with funds to be distributed on the model that the United States already has successfully developed for public broadcasting. Public radio is one of the few success stories in the recent history of the media; its federal structure\u2014a decentralized system mostly of private nonprofit stations, with a mix of public and private funds and competing public-radio networks\u2014helps minimize the risk of control by political incumbents.But it is hard to imagine a worse time to advocate aid to journalism. When the president calls the media 'the enemy of the people' and his party shares that disdain, proposals to support the press will inevitably be taken as partisan. Liberals should continue to think about such ideas\u2014and, unfortunately, there will be plenty of time for reflection. The most that we can expect in the interim is a recognition among foundations and other nonprofit sources of the urgent need to bolster journalism, especially at the local level.If your news feed is being altered by changes in a platform's algorithm, you ought to have a right of explanation in ordinary language. Efforts to change the policies of social media are also politically fraught. Resting their hopes on corporate self-regulation, several organizations are trying to promote independent fact-checking for use by platform companies. Both Facebook and YouTube have announced changes to their algorithms that they say will limit 'borderline content.' In Mark Zuckerberg's description[19], this is 'sensationalist and provocative content' that 'can undermine the quality of public discourse and lead to polarization.' Facebook is not blocking these posts, but it is limiting how often they show up in news feeds. In an explanation of how Facebook was preparing for the 2018 elections, Zuckerberg said[20], 'Posts that are rated as false [on the basis of independent fact-checkers] are demoted and lose on average 80% of their future views.'This kind of power, together with increases in 'content moderation,' is both necessary and worrisome. It is necessary because viral falsehoods, deepfake videos, and other forms of deception are a genuine threat to democracy, and social media can serve as a checkpoint. It is worrisome, however, because social media can just as easily serve as a choke point for free speech and do so in ways that those subject to control cannot detect, much less contest.Relying on independent fact-checking organizations is no escape from politics. According to a Pew survey[21], 70 percent of Republicans believe fact-checkers are biased, while only 29 percent of Democrats think so. In fact, the right has reason to be concerned about the fact-checking of its news sources. In a recent study of online news, Network Propaganda[22], Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts find that journalistic norms continue to constrain news organizations running from the center-right (for example, The Wall Street Journal) through the center to the left. But on the right they find an insular media ecosystem skewed toward the extreme, where even the leading news organizations (Fox and Breitbart) do not observe norms of truth-seeking.That is the context for conservative charges that Facebook, Google, and Twitter are biased against them. Ironically, after years of denouncing Democrats for supposedly wanting to bring back the Fairness Doctrine in broadcasting, some conservatives now want a new fairness doctrine for social media. Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, has proposed legislation[23] that would require internet intermediaries to demonstrate that they are politically unbiased to obtain the broad freedom from liability for user content conferred by federal law. The measure seems calculated to deter social media platforms from adopting criteria such as news source reliability in their news feeds and other algorithms.The Hawley proposal ought to serve as a cautionary signal about any kind of government content regulation of social media. But transparency is one function that government could usefully advance. Legislation could require that social media and other digital platforms regularly disclose how their algorithms work, including how they affect different kinds of content and viewpoints. If your news feed is being altered by changes in a platform's algorithm, you ought to have a right of explanation in ordinary language. Greater transparency would be a step toward what has come to be known as 'algorithmic accountability.'When the internet and digital economy were first emerging in the 1990s and early 2000s, it was unclear what shape they would take. The speed of change and its novelty were dazzling; a sober, historically informed analysis could not compete with dreams of a libertarian playground. But no one should continue to be under any illusions about the benign consequences of relying entirely on the market 'as an alternative to intervention by government.' The neoliberal internet era is over. A new wave of intervention is coming. Yet the tech firms have now grown so large and powerful, and the Trumpian right wing so opposed to journalism and its norms, that the shape of things to come is unclear again. The question now is whose interests and values will prevail in the digital world that politics will shape. Monopoly, surveillance, and disinformation are the immediate stakes; the ultimate issue is what kind of society we want to live in.

The European Union is on a mission to crack down on big tech companies such as Google, Twitter and Amazon, which are often accused of funneling EU sales through low-VAT Luxembourg. The reaction has come in the form of new VAT regulations, aimed at businesses that sell electronic products and services (digital services) to private individuals within the EU, regardless of the value of the sale.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This means that SMEs in the UK will have to charge and account for VAT in the member state where the digital services are sold - that is 75 different VAT rates in 28 different countries. For example, if a business sells a music streaming service to customers all over Europe, one of whom is in France and the other in the Netherlands, it will have to charge and account for VAT at the relevant rate for each country. This could affect anything from 34,000 to 460,000 SMEs in the UK, so it's important to know what these new regulations mean in practice and, as an SME, what steps should be taken in relation to these new rules.</p><h>What do the new VAT regulations really mean?</h><p>What used to be the case was that VAT on such services was charged in the country of the supplier - the new regulations change this and turn it upside down. From January VAT will be payable in the country where digital services are bought. This includes non-physical resources such as download services and ebooks, provided that they are sold to a private individual.</p><p>The reason this change will affect SMEs directly is because businesses with turnovers of less than \u00a381,000 a year are exempt from registering for UK VAT. This exemption will now be lost once an SME registers to pay VAT in another EU country and, as a result, UK VAT must also be charged and accounted for future sales. And there is no threshold - even if the sale is for 99p, there is an obligation to charge VAT in the relevant member state and on all subsequent sales in the UK. This will have the impact of increasing costs in the UK, which will have to be passed on to the customer or absorbed by the company, which in turn would lead to reduced profitability.</p><h>How to determine where services are supplied</h><p>Determining the location in which services are supplied can be a real challenge, particularly if customers use checkout services such as PayPal, where the company may only have an email address to go on. This means that the company will have to ask the customer for more details, potentially making the sale process more difficult.</p><h>Storing personal data</h><p>When it comes to data storage, your company will be obliged to store personal data such as customers' addresses and phone numbers, which means that it will have to register under the Data Protection Act and comply with its requirements in relation to data storage. This will increase the administrative burden for SMEs, particularly as audits can stretch back 10 years - which is the next point.</p><h>Increase in administration</h><p>HMRC has introduced a VAT Mini One Stop Shop (VAT MOSS) in order that companies do not have to register for VAT in every EU country where they make sales, and a single quarterly return can be submitted to cover all the VAT. However, despite this, the changes mean that affected companies face an increased compliance burden, both in terms of maintaining VAT records and complying with data protection regulations - and billing will become more difficult to manage. This can cause real difficulties for smaller companies, who typically have fewer staff and resources.</p><h>What can SMEs do?</h><p>Despite much lobbying on behalf of SMEs, who will be disproportionately affected by the changes, it seems unlikely that the government will have a change of heart at this late stage. Businesses who supply digital services in Europe face an unappealing choice between losing sales from Europe and therefore remaining VAT exempt in the UK, or having to pay an extra 20% on all earnings in the UK. This decision will most likely depend on the split in sales between Europe and the UK.</p><h>Be prepared</h><p>Affected businesses will need to audit their systems urgently, to ensure that they can capture the right sort of information to evidence where each customer lives and apply the correct VAT rate. In addition, they will need to decide how they will report and pay the VAT, and how the different VAT rates will affect their pricing and margins.</p><p>                     Carol Tricks is a partner at tech City law firmTemple Bright.                                        </p><p>                     Sign up to become a member of the                                            Guardian Small Business Network here                                          for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-24301510</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DST-08N1-JCJY-G02W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Cameras have become so ubiquitous that it can be easy to forget that they're there. That's what happened for some New Yorkers last week, when a vandal who attacked dozens of LinkNYC kiosks in New York City was caught red-handed by the cameras installed on the kiosks themselves, prompting shock from those who either didn't know or failed to notice that LinkNYC kiosks come equipped with cameras.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The incident, coupled with an apparently fake facial recognition camera mounted in a subway station, has reinvigorated a discussion of the many cameras and sensors that record, watch or collect data on private citizens, and what law enforcement agencies can do with that information. To clear up some of those questions, City &amp; State took a look at the rules \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 that govern the use of surveillance technologies in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> What is the NYPD's surveillance network?</p><p>New York's surveillance network \u2013 which can include low-tech closed-circuit television or high-tech facial recognition \u2013 is a vast one that includes both devices installed by private entities like businesses, as well as those deployed by the city government. To be sure, not every security camera in New York City is connected to a central database accessible to law enforcement agencies, but through the NYPD's Domain Awareness System, many of the city's surveillance-capable technologies do come together in one easily accessible platform.</p><p> Launched in 2012 as a partnership between the NYPD and Microsoft, the Domain Awareness System is a central command that the police department boasts is \"one of the world's largest networks of cameras, license plate readers, and radiological censors, designed to detect and prevent terrorist acts, but also of great value in criminal investigations.\" The system includes both real-time public CCTV cameras and those owned and operated by private entities that have given the department access to their feeds. Estimates have put the number of cameras worked into the system at 9,000, though Daniel Schwarz, privacy and technology strategist at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said that the number could be higher.</p><p> \"The NYPD maintains numerous cameras throughout the city for the deterrence, detection and investigation of crime and monitoring of traffic conditions,\" said Sgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the deputy commissioner of public information in an emailed statement, when asked for more details about that figure. \"This includes cameras used to detect terrorist threats. Public safety is a shared responsibility and we rely on our partners in the community to assist us in keeping our City safe by sharing evidence of crimes, including video.\" LinkNYC cameras, for example, are not connected to the system, but footage was voluntarily shared with the NYPD in order to assist in the investigation into the kiosks' vandal.</p><p> What are the laws regarding surveillance in New York state and New York City?</p><p> While New York and the NYPD's Domain Awareness System is a far cry from a genuine surveillance state \u2013 like, say, China \u2013 questions of where and how much government should monitor citizens' whereabouts or other personal data have arisen amid growing concerns about data collection by Big Tech companies like Facebook. As law enforcement adopts more advanced technologies like facial recognition and biometric surveillance, with accuracy is sometimes in doubt or that may produce racially biased results \u2013 advocates are calling for regulations specific to the new technologies.</p><p> To the disappointment of many privacy advocates, neither New York City nor the state have laws prohibiting or regulating the use of facial recognition technology when people are in public. What does exist in the New York penal code are protections regarding certain places where video recording or other surveillance cannot take place, such as locations like bathrooms or dressing rooms, where citizens have a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p><p> In the absence of regulations beyond barring surveillance where citizens have a reasonable expectation of privacy, there are nonetheless constitutional protections in place \u2013 primarily through the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \u2013 that Lee Rowland, policy director at the NYCLU said creates some guard against potentially questionable practices in New York. \"We all have to play by the constitutional rules, and the Fourth Amendment protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures by government,\" she said.</p><p> In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that government agencies generally need a warrant in order to collect mass amounts of customers' cell phone location data. The case stemmed from the conviction of an armed robber, which was made in part on the strength of data collected from the accused's cellphone, amounting to 127 days of records placing his phone at over 12,898 locations. \"The reality is, there may be many of these practices that, at least in government hands, do in fact violate the Fourth Amendment,\" Rowland said. \"So if the government is using facial recognition technology and recombining massive databases to create a granular picture of where you walk throughout the day, we believe that would violate the Fourth Amendment without a warrant. But, right now, we don't have a law that says so. We'd have to wait to challenge that in court and get a constitutional ruling.\"</p><p> What efforts have been made to create more protections against surveillance?</p><p> Since 2017, the New York City Council has weighed a bill aimed at increasing transparency and public input in how the NYPD uses its various surveillance technologies \u2013 whether that's facial recognition, license plate readers or Stingrays, a tool for tracking location data of a criminal suspect's cell phone. The Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act, would, among other things, require that the NYPD issue an impact and use policy about its surveillance technologies and require reporting of any new surveillance tech to the City Council.</p><p> Predictably, the bill has stalled under opposition from the NYPD and other law enforcement officials who have argued that making the details, use and whereabouts of all surveillance technology public would hinder their effectiveness. But City Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson, lead sponsor of the bill when it was reintroduced last fall, said that she doesn't think the legislation asks for too much, comparing it to cities that have required that the City Council approve the purchase of new law enforcement surveillance technologies. \"We're asking for basic reporting of large purchases the department makes through the contract process and we're also asking for a 30-day public comment period once the purchase announcement is made,\" Councilwoman Gibson said.</p><p> The bill has 16 sponsors, but Gibson said it still faces serious pushback from the law enforcement community. The goal now is to move it through the City Council, as it hasn't had a hearing since 2017. \"I've met with the administration, namely the NYPD, along with the mayor's office, to hear a lot of their concerns, and what I'm waiting for now is a series of different language that they believe could be incorporated in the bill where they would be on board,\" Gibson said.</p><p> Where else could surveillance technology be used in the city?</p><p> While the use of surveillance technology in public places, like city streets and subway platforms, has been the subject of recent debate, privacy advocates are also drawing attention to those who want to install facial recognition or other biometric surveillance equipment in residential buildings and schools. Rowland said the latter could spark a particularly negative outcome. \"Facial recognition technology in particular has a race problem,\" Rowland said. \"The technology's accuracy goes down dramatically along with the darkness of someone's skin tone. Particularly when we're talking about kids \u2013 and I think this is an issue in the tenant area as well \u2013 these systems are being installed, ostensibly to find outsiders, to find and single out outsiders. So you can imagine, a child of color, going to school, being identified by this technology as an outsider, and that triggering a security response.\"</p><p> A bill introduced by Assemblywoman Monica Wallace would ban the collection of biometric data in schools as well as conduct a study into the effects of its usage. Already, the Lockport City School District in western New York has bought facial recognition technology, though in part due to pushback from groups like the NYCLU, it has yet to use the tech.</p><p> There are also surveillance technologies that may not be immediately recognized as such, Rowland said. While video cameras are pretty widely understood to have the capability of recording and surveillance, the expansion of radio-frequency identification technology \u2013 including the RFID cards that will become the new norm for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority \u2013 prompts surveillance concerns for some, as the contactless RFID cards can be hacked or cloned. \"Technology does not have to be a camera to be able to track your movements and give either a corporation or the government a pretty specific list of where you've been and what you've been up to,\" Rowland said.</p><p> How are New York's surveillance practices different from those of other states?</p><p> While advocates at the NYCLU point to laws in cities including Seattle and Oakland, where a police department has to get approval from city councils to purchase new technologies, most localities lack specific protections just as New York does.</p><p> And even in places that have seen regulation, some see the security benefits of biometric technologies may outweigh privacy concerns. The NYCLU's education counsel Stefanie Coyle said that Florida has implemented a ban on collection on biometric information from children, but in the aftermath of school shootings \u2013 including the mass shooting in Parkland that killed 17 students \u2013 private security companies are making a case for more data collection as a safety measure.</p><p> Advocates of stronger protections against surveillance are aware of the need to strike a balance between harnessing the public safety benefits of these kinds of technologies, and protecting citizens from breaches of privacy. \"Obviously, I understand New York City is a lot different. We are always under constant threat,\" Gibson said. \"And when you see what's happening with these mass shootings and things that are happening at synagogues and churches, obviously, of course, I understand, and I'm very sympathetic to that. I also think there could be a minimal level of cooperation that we could get from the NYPD where we are getting some information.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A LinkNYC kiosk located in New York City's Midtown area.

It originates from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Super Mario Bros</emphasis>, in which a pixellated plumber must navigate a series of dangerous castles to rescue his love interest, Princess Peach. But at every turn Mario finds that his princess is in another, even deadlier castle.</p><p>  Nick Clegg is fluent in five languages but gaming isn\u2019t one of them. He might have to pick it up quickly in his new job as Facebook\u2019s chief lobbyist, because the social network hosts dozens of puzzles, platformers and other time-wasting plug-ins.</p><p>  The former Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister has stunned Westminster with his decision to start a new life in Silicon Valley. There is anger that he has abandoned the fight against Brexit (although not before talking to George Eaton for this week\u2019s cover story). And there is bafflement: the role of a lobbyist is to open doors, and in the UK Clegg\u2019s name is more likely to see them slammed shut. While there are some Conservative MPs who respect him, they are far from the levers of power; while the pro-Brexit wing hates his Europhilia and his role in frustrating many of their worst excesses in coalition.</p><p>  On the Labour side, the long-standing tribal dislike of the Liberal Democrats means that he has few friends, and none at all at the heart of the Corbyn project. In the United States, no British politician since Tony Blair has registered as a figure of note. Clegg is no exception.</p><p>  Yet his value to Facebook lies somewhere else: in the European Union. Clegg knows his way around Brussels. He was an aide to Leon Brittan during the latter\u2019s stint as a European commissioner, and he served as a Liberal Democrat MEP from 1999 to 2004.</p><p>  Although his brand of centrist liberalism has been squashed in Britain by first-past-the-post, the proportional systems that dominate in Europe ensure that leaders of Cleggite parties will be, if not in the highest office, at least in positions of influence. As much as any language, it is vital that Clegg speaks Brussels-ese.</p><p>  Why does that matter to Facebook? Because there are three main regulatory blocs in the world, which govern standards on fast-moving concerns such as data flows and privacy, as well as perennial ones such as taxation. Of the three, the EU presents a far bigger challenge than North America or China to the big tech companies. (The US\u2019s approach is largely laissez-faire, while many tech companies are banned or barely established in China because of its severe restrictions on internet freedom.)</p><p>  One of the inescapable truths of Brexit is that, after it finally happens, the United Kingdom will not be uppermost in the thoughts of any of the world\u2019s biggest corporations. While economists are largely united in expecting that leaving the European Union will make Britain poorer, it is at least possible that the British economy will defy those predictions. However, the one certain thing is that the UK will be less influential on the global stage when it steps outside one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent political and regulatory blocs.</p><p>  Tech power politics \u2013 at the level where Facebook, Google, Amazon and the rest operate \u2013 is mediated by those same three blocs: the US, the EU and China. The only question that matters in British politics is which one of those regulatory titans dictates our rules. We cannot simply \u201cgo our own way\u201d, as some Brexiteers glibly claim, if we want to trade with the rest of the world. The Conservative Party is split, therefore, between those who favour Europe for reasons of geography, and those who favour the US for reasons of sentiment.</p><p>  That said, what the Tory party wants may be irrelevant in the long run. Most lobbyists and their clients accept the strong possibility that the next government will be led by either Jeremy Corbyn or someone whose politics have a Corbynish hue. Public affairs firms with a large roster of domestic clients are keen to speak to and hire staff with a genuine connection to the Corbyn project. Lobbyists with large Labour contact books are once again in vogue.</p><p>  Big Tech, which prides itself on staying at the cutting edge, has been surprisingly slow to adapt to this change. Many of the largest firms employ a who\u2019s who of staff from either the old coalition government or a bygone era of New Labour politics. At Google, Tim Chatwin and Naomi Gummer, special advisers to David Cameron and Jeremy Hunt, rub shoulders with Theo Bertram, a veteran of both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown\u2019s inner circles. They have recently been joined by Michaela Neild, a former aide to Jon Ashworth, one of the few remaining right-wingers left in the shadow cabinet. Alongside Nick Clegg at Facebook is Ed Balls\u2019s former policy chief Karim Palant and the Liberal Democrat peer Richard Allan. At Uber, its recent hire Lottie Dominiczak worked for Tory MPs Matt Hancock and Damian Green. She joins Alex Belardinelli, a Balls-era Labour fixer.</p><p>  Nick Clegg\u2019s role is more high-profile (and far better paid) than any of these, and he will be based in California. However, it is part of the same story. The lack of Corbynite staffers isn\u2019t because Big Tech thinks a Corbyn government is impossible, but because there is a limit to what any British government can meaningfully do to affect their businesses.</p><p>  With the exceptions of the BBC and the Premier League, the UK\u2019s two greatest cultural exports, there are very few things that a radical British government, whether of the right or the left, could do to make anyone in Silicon Valley look up from their breakfast. For Jeremy Corbyn, any electoral triumph after Brexit will swiftly be followed by the realisation that his princess is in another castle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK0-6DJ1-DYX2-C1XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 New Statesman Ltd.

Beneath cloudless California skies, engineers in board shorts glide through the leafy campus on brightly coloured bicycles.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Step inside and find a cavalcade of attractions: giant stuffed animals and a VW camper van are parked up in the corridors beneath signs advertising belly dancing and K-Pop classes.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the distance, a colossal tent-like structure resembling a circus Big Top is under construction, which once complete in 2021 will be the company's new HQ.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amid all this excitement - and with gushing profits of over US$15 billion ($23.95b) in the first six months of this year - there should be plenty to smile about for Google's ringmaster in chief.  </p><p>But Sundar Pichai, 47, is in a sombre mood. Seated in a first-floor meeting room overlooking Silicon Valley, the search giant's chief executive admits the pressures of the job sometimes get to him.  </p><p>\"I don't sleep well when we get things wrong,\" he says. \"When we make a mistake it's obvious to the world. So it's something I feel.\"  </p><p>A lanky south Indian who joined Google in 2004 and has served as chief executive since 2015, these days Pichai has plenty to keep him up at night.  </p><p>Since its creation in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, PhD students at nearby Stanford University, Google has unleashed a blizzard of products on the world that have transformed the way we live - from its eponymous search engine to Gmail, Google Maps, the Android operating system and its Google Chrome browser.  </p><p>As a business, Google has become a formidable machine, generating colossal profits and turning Page and Brin into two of the world's richest men with a simple formula: hoovering up oodles of data on users and serving them up highly relevant ads. But as Google turns 21, the mood in Mountain View has darkened. It is Pichai who finds himself carrying the can.  </p><p>Besieged by concerns about toxic content, data privacy, tax and the use of Google's YouTube service by paedophiles and extremists, Pichai finds himself in a maelstrom of controversy over the role Big Tech companies play in society - and a battle with regulators over how to rein them in. He sets out the complex juggling act Google faces trying to keep up.  </p><p>\"We've been operating as a company for 20 years selling products for billions of users across many countries - and laws and regulations are evolving,\" he says.  </p><p>\"Sometimes the products and use cases evolve much faster, and we're in the middle of trying to make it work.\"  </p><p>As a father of two, how does he feel about children viewing toxic content on YouTube?  </p><p>\"Many of us are parents,\" he says. \"We deeply care about children's safety and privacy.\"  </p><p>As a software engineer, he sees the solution in improved technology to spot and remove malign content.  </p><p>\"The toughest problem is not everyone agrees sometimes what is problematic content, and that's hard.\"  </p><p>Google's sheer commercial heft is becoming a growing political problem too. With a 37 per cent share of the global digital advertising market, critics have long complained that Google - whose parent Alphabet, with a market value of US$858b is the world's fourth biggest company after Microsoft, Apple and Amazon - is simply too big.  </p><p>The European Commission's competition chief Margrethe Vestager has already levied fines on the company worth US$9.3b, but this month the pressure intensified on both sides of the Atlantic. Not only did Brussels reappoint Vestager to a new and enhanced role designed to take on Big Tech, but attorneys-general from 50 US states launched an investigation into Google's dominance in both search and advertising.  </p><p>The mild-mannered Pichai, who was paid US$1.8 million last year and has a fortune of more than US$1b, offers a measured response but treads carefully. \"It's fair that governments, which have a charter to protect their citizens, are thinking about what is the best way to approach that ... So there's going to be important regulations that need to happen in technology, like you've had in other industries.\"  </p><p>How would he respond in the event of an ordered breakup of Google - a proposal made by US presidential hopeful senator Elizabeth Warren?  </p><p>Pichai swerves the question, saying it's not for Google itself to determine whether it has become too large.  </p><p>\"It's a societal level conversation,\" he says. \"Should a company be this big or not - it's not for us to decide. What I can do is make sure we are working hard to build products that improve people's lives.\"  </p><p>However, Pichai does offer a spirited defence of the benefits of being a big company, which employs 107,000 people globally and shelled out US$16b on research and development in 2017, or 15 per cent of revenue.  </p><p>\"As a company we have hundreds of researchers who work on AI in healthcare to help better detect and treat diseases, or the work we do on cyber security or threats around deep fakes.\"  </p><p>Perhaps it's this deep engineering background that makes him favour clearer rules for how tech companies should operate.  </p><p>He praises Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation data privacy laws, for example. \"In Europe there is a clear framework for privacy so that users have certainty about how their privacy is protected. Companies have clarity about how they can build products and safeguard user data. Hopefully it's a template for the rest of the world.\"  </p><p>With his thoughtful manner and low-key style, Pichai is in some ways the antithesis of the flashy Silicon Valley tech tycoon.  </p><p>A strict vegetarian with a fondness for tea and long walks, he maintains a spartan office and lives with his wife and two children in what has been described as a \"shockingly modest\" home in nearby Los Altos.  </p><p>Google's chief executive hasn't received an equity award in two years because he turned down a big, new grant of options last year.  </p><p>The reason? He felt he was already paid too generously.  </p><p>Google's unofficial motto has long been the simple phrase \"don't be evil\", and more than any other company it has maintained a reputation for high ethical standards and liberal ideals.  </p><p>There have been times recently when that legacy has felt like a burden.  </p><p>Plans to build a censored search engine for China - where its regular service was blocked by Beijing in 2010 - were dropped following criticism and an internal revolt by employees.  </p><p>But Pichai says he remains proud of Google's \"strong ethical foundation\".  </p><p>\"We still use 'don't be evil',\" he says.  </p><p>\"It was always an unofficial expression that we used internally at Google and we still use it today. And we always approach our work with a set of ethical standards. Given the scale at which technology works, I don't see any other way.\"  </p><p>Does he ever worry about the future or the implications of some of the technology the company develops?  </p><p>Pichai pauses to consider his answer. It's important, he says, to design technology \"in a way which doesn't detract from the human experience and adds to the humanity of how things need to work\".  </p><p>\"I do worry about making sure when we're building technology, you're bringing everyone along. I worry about a future that may not have equal access to technology and its benefits for everyone.\"  </p><p>Nevertheless, Pichai says he remains an unavowed optimist.  </p><p>\"Technology made a difference in my life and I see evidence of that today across our products. We need to be responsible about how we deal with technology, but it will be a big driver of future growth and prosperity and we all need to work hard to make sure it benefits everyone.\"  </p><p>-Telegraph Group Ltd</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-NZHGoogly04</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X64-6YB1-JDK8-V0WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1259\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 4, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>STANFORD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

According to the Business Software Alliance (BSA), the top 5[1] in descending order are Japan, Australia, the U.S., Germany and Singapore, while emerging markets such as South Africa, Indonesia, Brazil, Thailand and Vietnam are at the bottom of the pile[2].</p><p><br/> But wait, what are we actually talking about here? To understand that, we first need to remind ourselves of what the BSA actually is: a lobbying association for software vendors ranging from Microsoft and Oracleto IBM and Apple. Probably best known for threatening small businesses over their use of 'pirated' software, the BSA just released its second Global Cloud Scorecard[3], which purports to rank countries according to the cloud-friendliness of their legislative and regulatory policies.<br/> In practice, the scoring criteria are \u2026 interesting. For example, intellectual property rights are in there. From the BSA document:<br/> 'Providers of cloud computing and digital economy technologies and services, as with other highly innovative products, rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other forms of intellectual property protection. Thus, to encourage investments in cloud research and development, as well as infrastructure, IP laws must provide strong incentives for these investments and clear protection and vigorous enforcement against misappropriation and infringement.'<br/> Presumably Japan's willingness to do things like arrest file-sharers[4] counted in its favor when the BSA was compiling its rankings. What does that have to do with cloud computing, in reality? Not a lot.<br/> Overall, the criteria we're looking at are these:<br/> Intellectual property rights: This is a heavily-weighted criterion. The BSA likes what Canada, Russia and India are doing, so they moved up the scale.<br/>Data privacy: The BSA is all about 'light touch regimes' here, explaining why Singapore, which introduced 'broad, principles-based' data privacy laws last year while avoiding too much prescriptive detail, jumped from number 10 to number 5. Korea, which has proposed stricter data privacy rules, comes in for severe criticism, although its number-8 position remained unchanged. The EU, which is revising its data privacy legislation, is urged to bring in 'clear rules', not a 'rigid framework'.<br/>Security: Here the BSA is talking about both nationally-coordinated security measures (good) and factors such as censorship (bad). Russia's score apparently took a hit because of internet censorship rules[5] introduced in 2012, for example.<br/>'Cybercrime': This is mainly about legal deterrents to attacks. As such attacks are frequently cross-border, I'm not sure what the value is here, but it is at least theoretically a valid factor when talking about cloud policy.<br/>Promoting free trade: Here the BSA seems mainly concerned with countries' attitudes towards buying equipment from international suppliers, who - surprise surprise - will probably be BSA members. Still, with so much of the innovation in cloud technology coming from the U.S., they may have a point.<br/>Infrastructure: This is the most heavily-weighted criterion, and sensibly so. It's the criterion that makes the most objective sense when talking about cloud-readiness.<br/>So, how seriously should we take this scorecard? It's difficult to say. Much of it is sensible, some is debatable and some is laughable - I'm sorry, but no matter how much you're in favor of intellectual property rights, they don't have a major effect on 'cloud readiness'. For a much more reasonable take on such things, look for rankings that stick to criteria such as computer penetration, infrastructure and GDP[6].<br/> Nonetheless, the BSA scorecard does give a good flavor of what the big tech firms want to see when it comes to cloud policy \u2014 we can see this stance reflected in concerted lobbying operations around the world[7], so it is worth understanding.<br/><br/>Related research and analysis from GigaOM Pro: Subscriber content.

He allegedly  published on CrossRiverWatch, a report considered offensive against the Cross River State Governor, Benedict Ayade, and which also involved a micro-finance bank.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On August 30, Jalingo was charged with alleged disturbance of public peace and treason for his writing and social media posts about the governor. He is also facing a two-count charge of terrorism, alleged plans to work with Omoyele Sowore, cult membership and a plot to 'commit acts of terrorism' to unseat Ayade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The July 12 article reportedly identified Jalingo as the Cross River State chairman of the African Action Congress Party, founded by Omoyele Sowore.</p><p>Sowore, the convener of the August 3 #RevolutionNow protests, is also on trial for alleged treason.</p><p>If convicted of the offence, Jalingo could face up to three years in prison for the disturbance charge and life imprisonment for treason as stipulated in the Criminal Code.</p><p>Also on November 12, in Ilorin, the Editor of an Abuja-based online newspaper, NewsDigest, Mr. Gidado Yushau and award-winning campus journalist Alfred Olufemi were arraigned before a Magistrate Court.</p><p>Their arrest and arraignment were sequel to a petition from a company reportedly owned by the Special Adviser to the President on Finance and Economy, Sarah Alade, over an investigative report published on May 19, 2018 on hemp smoking on her farm.</p><p>The report titled: 'Inside Kwara factory where Indian hemp smoking is 'legalised,' was authored by Olufemi, a student journalist from one of the universities.</p><p>The company's management has since refuted the claims in the publication.</p><p>Last Tuesday, Gidado and Alfred were charged with criminal conspiracy and defamation contrary to Sections 97 and 192 of the Penal Code.</p><p>The charge stated that the two defendants 'criminally conspired to tarnish the name and image of Hillcrest Agro-Allied Industries'.</p><p>They pleaded not guilty and were granted bail. The case was adjourned till January 13.</p><p>A deluge of laws?</p><p>While Jalingo was charged for his online publication, under the Criminal Code, Gidado and Alfred were charged under the Penal Code.</p><p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the Criminal Code, Penal Code and the Cybercrime Act prohibiting offensive publications on news websites, the Senate is again considering a new law to combat hate speech.</p><p>The Bill, tagged The National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speeches (Estb., etc) Bill 2019', is proposing death by hanging for anyone found guilty of any form of hate speech that damages the reputation or results in the death of another person.</p><p>The Bill sponsored by the Deputy Chief Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, representing Niger North, last Tuesday, passed the first reading in the Red Chamber of the ninth assembly.</p><p>The proposed hate speech bill has not got to the final stage as it must go through  more readings, debate and participation of the members of the public and assent of the Executive before it can become a law, if not rejected.</p><p>Other provisions of the bill</p><p>The bill proposes punishment for other offences. For harassment on grounds of ethnicity or race, it recommends that the offender shall be sentenced to 'not less than a five-year jail term or a fine of not less than N10 million or both.'</p><p>It also states that 'A person who uses, publishes, presents, produces, plays, provides, distributes and/or directs the performance of any material, written and/or visual, which is threatening, abusive or insulting or involves the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour' commits an offence.</p><p>It states that the charge would be justified if such a person intends to stir up 'ethnic hatred'.</p><p>Furthermore, 'Any person who commits an offence under this section shall be liable to life imprisonment and where the act causes any loss of life, the person shall be punished with death by hanging.'</p><p>In other sections, the Bill states: 'A person who uses, publishes, presents, produces, plays, provided, distributes and/or directs the performance of any material, written and or visual which is threatening, abusive or insulting or involves the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour commits an offence if such person intends thereby to stir up ethnic hatred, or having regard to all the circumstances, ethnic hatred is likely to be stirred up against any person or person from such an ethnic group in Nigeria.</p><p>'Any person who commits an offence under this section shall be liable to life imprisonment and where the act causes any loss of life, the person shall be punished with death by hanging.</p><p>'In this section, ethnic hatred means hatred against a group or persons from any ethnic group indigenous to Nigeria.'</p><p>On discrimination against persons, the bill states: 'For the purpose of this act, a person discriminates against another person, if on ethnic grounds, the person without any lawful justification treats another Nigerian citizen less favourably than he treats or would treat other persons from his ethnic or another ethnic group and/or that on grounds of ethnicity a person puts another person at a particular disadvantage when compared with other persons from other nationality of Nigeria.</p><p>'A person also discriminates against another person if, in any circumstances relevant for the purposes referred to in subsection (1)(b), he applies to that person of any provision, criterion or practice which he applies or would apply equally to persons not of the same race, ethnic or national origins as that other.'</p><p>On harassment on the basis of ethnicity, the Bill provides thus: 'A person (who) subjects another to harassment on the basis of ethnicity for the purposes of this section where on ethnic grounds, he justifiably engages in a conduct which has the purpose or effect of: (a) Violating that other person's dignity or (b) Creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating, or offensive environment for the person subjected to the harassment.</p><p>'Conduct shall be regarded as having the effect specified in subsection (1) (a) or (b) of this section if, having regard to all circumstances, including in particular the perception of that other person, it should resonably be considered as having that effect.</p><p>'A person who subjects another to harassment on the basis of ethnicity commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to an imprisonment for a term not less than ten years, or to a fine of not less than ten million naira, or to both.'</p><p>Commission on Hate Speech</p><p>The objectives and functions of the proposed Commission on Hate Speech, according to the Bill, includes to facilitate and promote a harmonious, peaceful co-existence among people of all ethnic groups indigenous to Nigeria and, more importantly, to achieve this objective by ensuring the elimination of all forms of hate speeches in Nigeria, and to advise the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on all aspects thereof.</p><p>Curiously, Senator Abdullahi sponsored the same Bill in the eighth assembly but failed as it was blocked by the then Senate President, Bukola Saraki.</p><p>It is also curious that the Bill, like it did in 2017, renewed its proposal for death penalty for any person found guilty of making or publishing hate speech.</p><p>Social Media Regulation Bill</p><p>Aside from the Hate Speech Bill, there is also the Social Media Regulation Bill which was introduced to the Senate two weeks ago. It seeks to regulate what goes on the social media and  punish what it termed 'abuse of social media'. The Bill proposed a three-year jail term or N150,000 fine or both for those found guilty</p><p>The Social Media Regulation Bill titled: 'Protection from Internet falsehood and manipulations bill, 2019' is sponsored by Senator Mohammed Sani Musa (Niger East).</p><p>Support for social media regulation?</p><p>The Federal government has not been categorical on the bills. Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed, last Thursday at a meeting with the Guild of Corporate Online Publishers (GOCOP) in Abuja, said there were many options open to the government to regulate social media.</p><p>Mohammed said the government could leverage on technology, working with big tech firms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram to check the spread of fake news and hate speech.</p><p>According to him, 'it is premature for anyone to say that there are enough laws already to deal with social media deviants'.</p><p>He said the process for social media regulation would not be unilateral because government would carry relevant stakeholders along. 'Let me announce here that we have just kick-started the process. We have dispatched letters inviting representatives of the media, civil society, technology and security experts, online publishers, bloggers, relevant agencies of government, etc, for this purpose.</p><p>'It will involve all stakeholders coming together to chart the path forward. In essence, the committee we plan to set up will determine the best option for us to use,' he said.</p><p>Mohammed said from October 29, when he announced government's plan to sanitise social media, there had been intense debate on the issue.</p><p>'This is a welcome development because the announcement has pushed the issue of social media to the front burner and we can only benefit from such debate.</p><p>'We have been monitoring the debate. Some analysts and commentators have supported our plan, while others have opposed it.</p><p>'An interesting part of the debate has been that even those who opposed the regulation have acknowledged the dangers inherent in the irresponsible use of the social media, especially by anarchists and non-patriots,' he said.</p><p>'No plan to stifle free speech'</p><p>The minister explained that contrary to opposing sentiments, the planned regulation was not aimed at stifling free speech and muzzling the media.</p><p>'The fear of stifling free speech or muzzling the media is totally unfounded. We have no such plans.</p><p>'As we speak, people are on the social media criticising the Administration. We have no problem with that, because it is part of democracy.</p><p>'This is a democracy and there should be plurality of opinions.</p><p>'But our concern has to do with the abuse of social media by those who are bent on spreading fake news and hate speech, and the dangers inherent in that for our national peace and unity.</p><p>'We have no hidden agenda,' he said.</p><p>According to Mohammed, while the government welcomes a robust debate on the issue, the criticisms in certain quarters would not stop it from going ahead with sanitising the social media space.</p><p>He said Nigeria was not alone, countries including Germany, UK, Singapore, China, South Korea, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia are doing something about social media abuse.</p><p>Opposition in the Senate</p><p>Expectedly, the proposed bill has generated reactions.</p><p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the Senate has already stated its decision to oppose any proposed legislation that would infringe on the rights of Nigerians.</p><p>Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, during a meeting with the Leadership and Accountability Initiative, said PDP senators would oppose the Social Media Regulation Bill if it threatened the fundamental rights of Nigerians guaranteed in Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.</p><p>Abaribe said there were already laws that deal with issues the proposed law seeks to regulate.</p><p>He urged Nigerians to ensure mutual respect while freely expressing their views.</p><p>'What I can assure you is that this Senate can't be a party to removing the rights of Nigerians under any guise. Section 39 of the Constitution talks about our freedom as citizens. The 9th Senate will not abridge your rights.</p><p>'I don't think Nigerians who fought and paid the supreme price to entrench this democracy will easily give it away and make us go back to the dark days', he said.</p><p>Leader of the group, Nwaruruahu Shield, insisted that since there were already existing laws dealing with defamation, it is superfluous to introduce a fresh anti-social media Bill.</p><p>Lawyers oppose bill</p><p>Some other stakeholders also regard the Bill as an 'over reach and over kill' against the back ground of the country's existing laws. To them, on-line and social media publications are already over-regulated and existing laws are adequate to curb hate speech.</p><p>They are also curious as to why Senator Abdullahi would re-introduced a bill that was  rejected and failed to sail through the eighth assembly, to the ninth assembly. To them, if the intention of the bill is in the public interest, it would have been debated and passed by the previous assembly.</p><p>Many of those who oppose the bill are Constitutional lawyers and activists, with some of them threatening legal action.</p><p>They include Chairman, Council of Legal Education Chief Emeka Ngige (SAN), former General Secretary Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Dele Adesina SAN, activist-lawyer Femi Falana (SAN) and former President Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), Malachy Ugwummadu.</p><p>Ngige expressed doubts on the possibility of the bill ever getting  passed.</p><p>'I believe that that bill will never reach the stage of passage. When there is a public hearing, members of the public, NGOs will come and make their contributions and from which I believe the senate and members of the House of Representatives will remove the wheat from the chaff.</p><p>'But I must also tell you that there is no law or there is no man that doesn't have responsibilities.</p><p>'Social media in Nigeria, the way it is, if we leave it and don't control it, it can lead to the next civil war. There is a lot of statements that have caused a lot of confusion and a lot of disputes are on the rise. So, there must be restrictions but the restriction must not be by the way of killing people. There are ways that that could be done, it can be put in a way that it would not be abused. But the way I see it, the laws need some panel beating', he said.</p><p>Adesina stated that apart from not knowing what hate speech is, he believes that the law of defamation is more than sufficient to take care of this situation.</p><p>'I can sue anybody over and over again if there is an infraction of your rights and you can claim damages for whatever injuries that have been done to you in that situation.</p><p>'So, that leads me to the problem to know whether we need a new law that will have the kind of heavy punishment that they are proposing, particularly in a political democracy. They thought we need it and if that law eventually passes, there would be a huge out-cry on the part of the public to determine the limit and scope of that law in view of provisions of the constitution', he said.</p><p>Falana said he was 'convinced beyond a shadow of any doubt' that members of the Senate have not familiarised themselves with the relevant provisions of the Penal code, the Criminal Code and the Cybercrime Act.</p><p>According to him, 'the Cybercrime Act of 2015, particularly, sections 24 and 26 have very draconian provisions. Currently, the Buhari administration is using the provisions of the law to deal with journalists. One of the counts in the charge against Omowole Sowore is that he used the medium of Arise Television to insult President Muhammadu Buhari and that offence is known as cybercrime.</p><p>'Just yesterday (last Tuesday) a journalist was arraigned in Ilorin for alleging that some workers were smoking marijuana in the farm of a former Deputy Governor of Central Bank (CBN), Mrs Sarah Alade. So, there are other journalists who are being harassed for embarrassing government officials. In other words, anybody who can send any message through any network, be it computer, telephone, whatever, has been captured by the provisions of the Cybercrime Act'.</p><p>He advised that 'instead of dragging Nigeria to the mud and exposing her to international odium by prescribing death penalty for alleged cases, our legislators should be advised to nip it in the bud and stop further debate on that primitive piece of legislation.</p><p>'If it is passed through any error or omission, we are going to challenge it. Such a law cannot stand in the light of Section 39 of the Constitution and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights'.</p><p>According to him, similar laws have been declared illegal in the ECOWAS Court of Justice and African Court on Human Rights.</p><p>'In other words, if the law is passed, we are going to challenge it before our municipal courts or outside the country.</p><p>'We are not going to allow the Senate to abrogate the rights that we have fought for and won. I am going to recommend this to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and draw their attention to the case of Authur Nwankwo V The state decided in 1983 by the Court of Appeal.</p><p>'The Court of Appeal made it clear in that case that having regards to Section 36 of the Constitution then, which is now Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, no public officer shall be allowed to use the machinery of the government to harass his or her political opponent. In other words, if you are offended by any publication of any stable, you are required to go to court and sue in your private capacity if you have any reputation to protect.</p><p>'That is the position of the law. That law has not been altered. So we want to advise members of the National Assembly to stop further debate on this piece of legislation', Falana said.</p><p>Ugwummadu claimed that 'indicators of an emerging fascism in Nigeria are becoming clearer.'</p><p>He lamented that the 'character and dimension of state intolerance to citizens' participation in governance are now established and frightening.</p><p>According to him, the 'relentless efforts to muzzle the press and free speech are also indicative of a hidden agenda by the ruling class and over which the government is no longer disposed to.'</p><p>While admitting that hate speeches, are condemnable and capable of disrupting social orders  and equilibrium, he argued that the government 'is certainly over reaching itself when it consistently devises legislative mechanisms to circumvent the freedom of Nigerians to expression.'</p><p>Ugwummadu recalled that attempts were made in the past 'to stifle, muffle social media practitioners and platforms in the public space', through this proposed hate speech bill.</p><p>'The concerns now are: how will this power not be susceptible to abuse? Who will superintend the affairs of the proposed commission? Whose discretionary judgment determines a hate speech? Of what relevance and conflict will other legislations on the issue including the Cybercrimes Act become with the promulgation of the proposed bill?</p><p>'What is the cost implications of establishing other bureaucracies including a Commission with a fresh work force and conflicting mandates. How farther are we moving away from the established sound principle of law', he asked.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>'If it is passed through any error or omission, we are going to challenge it. Such a law cannot stand in the light of Section 39 of the Constitution and Article 9 of the African Charter on</p><p>Human and Peoples' Rights'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TETION-NIGNAT1911201900629</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TETION2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJC-61K1-F00C-63RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416485</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3181\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Nation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation (Nigeria)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Labor &amp;

Despite its vows to beef up its threadbare regulatory apparatus, Ireland has a long history of catering to the very companies it is supposed to oversee, having wooed top Silicon Valley firms to the Emerald Isle with promises of low taxes, open access to top officials, and help securing funds to build glittering new headquarters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, data-privacy experts and regulators in other countries alike are questioning Ireland's commitment to policing imminent privacy concerns like Facebook's reintroduction of facial recognition software and data sharing with its recently purchased subsidiary WhatsApp, and Google's sharing of information across its burgeoning number of platforms.</p><p>Interviews with scores of privacy experts, data watchdogs, academics and regulators in other countries reveal increasing concern that the landmark General Data Protection Regulation, the product of years of wrangling with data companies, is vulnerable because of the one provision on which the tech companies prevailed: That the lead regulator be in the country in which the tech firms have their \"data controller\" - in most cases, Ireland. </p><p>\"We need to be careful and ensure that the margin for maneuver given by the GDPR doesn't lead to an attractiveness competition between EU countries, as is already the case for taxation,\" Marie-Laure Denis, France's new chief privacy regulator, warned the French parliament in January, in a clear reference to Ireland. \"I don't want to see a race [between EU countries] to attract or keep the headquarters of the big tech actors.\"</p><p>Ireland's willingness to crack down on the companies that dominate its economy has long been questionable, even when its regulatory officials spot a potential violation. Such a situation developed with Facebook in 2011, in events detailed here for the first time.</p><p>Years before the social-media giant unwittingly released the personal data of 87 million users that made its way to Cambridge Analytica and the 2016 Trump campaign, Ireland's data-privacy regulator found that it was failing to screen applications in a way that could have prevented the breach.</p><p>The then-head of Ireland's Data Protection Commission recorded his complaint in a 2011 audit report that zeroed in on how Facebook was allowing outside app developers to gain access to oceans of \"friend\" data. Facebook pushed back on the finding, according to the agency, and the Irish regulator backed off, issuing an almost perfect score for Facebook's privacy practices in a follow-up report a year later. The rampant exposure of data wasn't corrected until years later - too late to prevent the Cambridge Analytica breach.</p><p>Ireland's failure to safeguard huge stores of personal information looms larger now that the country is the primary regulator responsible for protecting the health information, email addresses, financial records, relationship status, search histories and friend lists for hundreds of millions of Americans, Europeans and other users around the globe.</p><p>Already, regulators in other countries are expressing concern over Ireland's failure this year to crack down on Facebook's sharing of data with the messaging tool WhatsApp, which it purchased in 2014.</p><p>According to the EU, Facebook misled European officials into believing the two networks would not exchange information, thereby allaying concerns at the time of the merger that WhatsApp users could be drawn into Facebook's web. In 2016, a German court found that the two networks were indeed sharing data, and barred Facebook and WhatsApp from exchanging information about German users. The ban became unenforceable when the GDPR took effect and Ireland became the lead supervisory authority. Now, German authorities say the sharing has resumed and Ireland must crack down. For their part, Irish officials said in a statement they're satisfied that Facebook and WhatsApp aren't sharing information for the purposes of \"friend suggestion or enhanced advertising.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook took advantage of Ireland's assumption of the lead regulator role last May to reintroduce its facial recognition tool, which had been banned in the EU out of fear that photos would be used to track people without their permission. Facebook says it will not utilize the photo data until it receives consent from individuals. But other EU regulators and privacy lawyers contend that merely storing the photographs amounts to an unauthorized taking of data under GDPR rules. Although Irish authorities have suggested they share many of the lawyers' concerns and have begun a preliminary \"examination,\" they have yet to launch a formal probe.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, aroused the ire of regulators in other countries last year by failing to obtain consent before sharing data among its fast-growing line of networks and products - from YouTube to Google Photos to Gmail and more. Irish regulators declined to open a probe against Google, which had consolidated most of its operations for Europe, Middle East and Africa in Ireland, arguing that the company had not yet finished the paperwork that would give Irish regulators \"lead supervisory authority.\" The paperwork was finished in January, but Ireland has yet to announce an investigation.</p><p>Critics, including German authorities, insist that the Irish Data Protection Commission had the authority to launch a probe without Google's consent, and should have done so. Meanwhile, France stepped in to issue its first-ever fine under GDPR against the company for (EURO)50 million.</p><p>The head of the Irish Data Protection Commission, Helen Dixon, declined requests for interviews. Her spokesman, Graham Doyle, wrote in an emailed response to POLITICO's questions that the commission takes its regulatory responsibilities seriously and has 16 investigations underway, probing complaints against networks including Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Apple, along with seven probes involving Facebook.</p><p>The Irish Data Protection Commission is \"one of the most strongly resourced data protection authorities in Europe\" and stands ready to impose \"fines and firm remedies when appropriate,\" he wrote.</p><p>Doyle said the commission, which earlier this decade was so obscure it was headquartered in a small office above a convenience store in the tiny village of Portarlington, is recruiting state-of-the-industry experts to join its staff of approximately 140 people currently working out of temporary offices in Dublin, with a goal of eventually employing 180 people.</p><p>He noted the agency's tough new enforcement powers include fines of up to 4 percent of a company's annual worldwide revenues and cited the agency's willingness to enforce privacy rules by pointing to a pre-GDPR case in which Irish regulators ordered LinkedIn to delete data on nonmembers.</p><p>He rejected any suggestion that the agency is being overly deferential to companies under its purview, but added: \"Those with an interest in data protection don't always agree on every point, and we respect that.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, regulators in other EU countries, particularly Germany, remain skeptical, maintaining that Ireland is letting major complaints slide and creating the risk of a regulatory safe zone in Europe. So, too, are independent experts who are familiar with the actions of the Irish Data Protection Commission.</p><p>\"It's the appearance of an investigation rather than the substance of one,\" said the independent Dublin-based data management consultant Daragh O'Brien, referring to the Ireland's data enforcement culture, which he scrutinizes closely.</p><p>Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy advocate behind some of the most successful legal challenges against major technology companies, said he believes Ireland's approach to regulation is more or less unchanged since 2012.</p><p>\"They've basically gotten smarter about not doing things,\" said Schrems, whose initial complaint about transatlantic sharing of data was thrown out by the Irish regulator in 2013, only to succeed in European courts, bringing down the transatlantic data flow known as Safe Harbor.</p><p>Ireland continues to take a more corporate-friendly approach to regulation than many of its EU counterparts, openly favoring negotiation over sanctions and lists of questions over on-site inspections.</p><p>For example, as of last October, the Data Protection Commission had yet to dispatch any regulatory agents to Facebook's Dublin headquarters, despite its multiple investigations, according to a person close to the matter who spoke under the condition of anonymity. Rather than seek answers more aggressively, the regulator has been satisfied by \"updates\" from Facebook's headquarters that often reveal little more than what's been said in public statements. Both Facebook and the DPC declined to say whether any on-site visits had taken place since 2011.</p><p>Around the same time, France posted its own regulatory officers inside Facebook's offices to monitor the network's efforts to police hate speech and terrorist content, a core concern in many countries where terrorists have connected via social media and hate speech encouraged racist or sectarian violence. But France has no authority to enforce standards beyond its borders.</p><p>Privacy watchdogs also voice concerns about the 2014 appointment of Dixon, an Irish civil servant with no prior experience in regulatory enforcement, to replace Billy Hawkes, the regulator who initially presided over the finding of Facebook's over-sharing of data with researchers and developers of third-party apps.</p><p>If Ireland were serious about cracking down on privacy violations, some legal professionals said, it would have followed the lead of the United Kingdom and appointed an outside specialist with a history in law enforcement or regulatory investigation. Moreover, they said, Dixon's budget is overseen by the Irish Justice Ministry, while other data regulators, like the U.K.'s, are financed through fees on the companies they oversee. That could make her, or any future chief regulator, more susceptible to interference by government officials, who have long cultivated close relationships with tech executives.</p><p>In 2014, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, personally lobbied Enda Kenny, then Ireland's prime minister, over the selection of a data protection chief, according to emails revealed by the Irish Independent.</p><p>Now, just as some of its investigations should be wrapping up - with Dixon telling Bloomberg News in January that her office would announce decisions by midyear - the Data Protection Commission is launching an \"international consultation on regulation strategy\" that some critics fear will be an invitation for corporations to critique its practices.</p><p>Doyle said the agency will reach out to a broad range of as yet unnamed parties to weigh in on how Ireland should apply regulation. Doyle declined to say whether those consultants would come from the tech industry, only specifying that the panel would be \"international.\"</p><p>The call for advice is symptomatic of what Dixon's critics among privacy advocates, lawyers and other EU data protection authorities argue is a preference for resolving issues amicably over public enforcement actions, which Dixon, in speeches, has suggested might expose the regulator to extremely costly legal battles. It's a reasonable fear in a place where the tech companies' resources far outstrip the government's. Google's market capitalization, by itself, is twice the size of Ireland's gross domestic product. Facebook's is larger by about a third.</p><p>\"Regulation is a particularly fraught area for a country like Ireland because they have less leverage [over companies] than a bigger country,\" said Josephine Wolff, a professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology. \"If Facebook announced tomorrow, 'We've had it with Ireland, we are closing down our office,' that would be a huge deal with political and economic consequences for the whole country.\"</p><p>The story of how a country known for poetry and dark ale ended up in the unlikely role of global tech policeman stretches back to the aftermath of World War II.</p><p>As a neutral power, Ireland had emerged physically undamaged from the war but with a sputtering economy and bleak prospects. It had limited access to U.S. reconstruction funds from the European Recovery Program, or Marshall Plan, due to its neutral position, and no industrial base to speak of, thanks largely to Britain's long-held interest in keeping Roman Catholic southern Ireland in a firmly agrarian state. (Ireland won independence from Britain in 1919.) There was little chance of jump-starting domestic manufacturing 250 years after the rest of Europe, so Irish leaders turned to the next best thing: nurturing ties with countries that had flourishing industries of their own.</p><p>Spurred on by an economist and central banker named Thomas Kenneth Whitaker, Ireland's leaders oversaw an economic transformation starting in the late 1950s - away from protectionism, toward free trade and encouraging foreign investment. The most obvious partner was the United States, to which generations of Irish people had emigrated and whose Irish-origin population already far surpassed the population at home.</p><p>So began Ireland's epic and enduring courtship of U.S. corporations. Via the Irish Development Agency, a powerful entity that acts as a sales office for the country, the Emerald Isle established missions across the United States, dispatching dozens of agents to start preaching the good word about Ireland to U.S. companies from New York to San Francisco.</p><p>One of these investment missionaries was Larry Mone, a former accountant who joined the IDA in the late 1970s because he was, in his own words, \"really bad at\" accounting.</p><p>After a brief stint in Chicago, Mone was sent out to join the IDA's office in what was already known as Silicon Valley. In an office that overlooked a golf course, Mone and his colleagues spent their days trying to coax emerging digital giants - Microsoft chief among them - over to Ireland. Working from an alphabetical list of the important companies in the region, they spent their days cold-calling executives in an atmosphere he describes as \"boiler room-like.\"</p><p>\"We had an almost messianic zeal to bring jobs to Ireland,\" Mone, who's now retired and lives in Palo Alto, said in a telephone conversation.</p><p>Mone's section of the list covered companies with names from the letter G to the letter O and included giants like Microsoft and Intel, which would both go on to establish major footholds in Ireland. Apple set up its first manufacturing plant in Cork in 1980, setting off a wave of tech companies coming to the country.</p><p>The pitch, as Mone recalled, was \"very simple.\" Any product exported from Ireland would be totally exempt from taxation. That was later updated, under EU pressure, to a 10-percent flat rate that could be offset in other ways. When added to the promise of cheap labor, cheap land and an English-speaking workforce, this amounted to an almost unbeatable argument for locating sales operations in Ireland, because it would allow U.S. firms to reach hundreds of millions of European consumers without facing the heavy corporate taxes in France, Germany or even the Netherlands.</p><p>The IDA's approach had other refinements, like inviting top tech executives over to Ireland for country tours during which they would be entertained, fed whiskey and \"sent home punch-drunk, in love with the country,\" according to Mone. It didn't hurt that Ireland shares a common-law legal system with the United States.</p><p>But the basic argument - which remains Ireland's unique selling point today, despite intensifying scrutiny of its tax practices by the European Commission - never varied: not having to hand over a significant portion of income to the Irish taxman.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, these are profit-drive companies, and they go where the offer is the most profitable,\" Mone said.</p><p>Data regulation wasn't an issue at the time when most of the companies were recruited, but Ireland did everything in its power to create an industry-friendly landscape.</p><p>\"Back in those days there really was not much thought given to regulation of the technology industry, more what could be done to foster its development and bring it on shore,\" he said.</p><p>The pitch was so seductive that, over the next 30 years, Ireland morphed into what Mone calls \"the 51st state of the United States.\"</p><p>Google and Facebook both landed in Ireland during the first decade of the new century. While the highly advantageous tax arrangements they enjoyed came under pressure from the European Commission (Apple was forced to pay the Irish government $13 billion in back taxes that Ireland had neglected to collect), regulation was just starting to become a concern.</p><p>Ireland's 1995 Data Protection Act lacked significant enforcement mechanisms - so much so that Billy Hawkes, then the head of the Irish Data Protection Commission, had no legal power to apply any sanctions or penalties against the companies he was regulating in the years leading up to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. His successor, Dixon, herself acknowledged the lax culture in 2015, one year into her job, mentioning the problem of \"forum-shopping\" and perceptions that companies locate where \"soft, incompetent or under-resourced regulators are.\"</p><p>In the event that any regulatory issue should arise, as it did in the 2011 audit involving Facebook's sharing of data with app developers, U.S. companies had a powerful insurance policy: access to top Irish politicians via direct contacts or through the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland in Dublin, which continues to play an outsize role in shaping the direction of Irish policy. Top tech executives had Hawkes' cellphone number and could access him directly whenever they had a need, according to two people with knowledge of such calls.</p><p>This welcoming atmosphere explains why Facebook, in particular, kept doubling down on its Irish presence throughout the 2000s, according to Sandy Parakilas, former operations manager for Facebook who left the company in 2012.</p><p>\"It was simply the country with the least regulatory scrutiny,\" he explained in a phone conversation from Los Angeles, where he is now senior product marketing manager, privacy, for Apple.</p><p>That statement was put to the test during Ireland's 2011 audit of the company. Prompted by a groundswell of complaints against Facebook, Hawkes' deputy, Gary Davis, undertook what is likely to have been the most in-depth review of Facebook's privacy practices ever. In his capacity as lead regulator not just for Europeans but Facebook users worldwide, Davis' staff spent three months scouring the company's machinery, including sending officers to its Dublin headquarters to investigate first hand.</p><p>His first report, published in December 2011, called for dozens of changes and upgrades to Facebook's privacy practices, including its practices for screening third-party apps.</p><p>\"We do not consider that reliance on developer adherence to best practice or stated policy in certain cases is sufficient to ensure security of user data,\" the report stated. \"This is not considered sufficient by this Office to assure users of the security of their data once they have third party apps enabled. We expect FB-I [Facebook Ireland] to take additional steps to prevent applications from accessing user information other than where the user has granted an appropriate permission.\"</p><p>Parakilas, who was Facebook's \"point person\" on privacy matters at the time, said the criticism did not rile the company. Facebook responded to the audit in a \"professional manner\" but did not feel pressure to make fundamental changes, he said. When Parakilas tried to escalate concerns about the key critical findings in the original audit report, he was brushed off by senior executives.</p><p>At the time, Facebook expressed its concern about the audit to Irish officials, according to later testimony by Dixon before a government committee. Afterward, the Data Protection Commission appeared to go out of its way to give Facebook a clean bill of health.</p><p>In a 74-page follow-up report published in 2012, the commission declared that \"most of the recommendations [had] been fully implemented to our full satisfaction.\" On its call to improve screening of third-party apps, where major problems later emerged, the report stated: \"Satisfactory response from FB-I.\" A year later, Davis left the commission to join Apple as its chief privacy officer.</p><p>\"They didn't go anywhere near as far as you would have hoped,\" Parakilas said, referring to the Irish commission. Parakilas, who left Facebook in 2012, added that he doubts Ireland's approach to regulation has changed substantially.</p><p>\"Facebook is certainly the one that has the leverage in that relationship,\" he said.</p><p>Asked whether Ireland had done enough to stop the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Doyle said the commission had gone as far as it could, within its legal limitations, in simply flagging the problem with app developers and seeking changes to Facebook's privacy practices. He pointed to comments Davis had made outside the report saying there were \"still a number of items on which progress has not been as 'fully forward' as hoped,\" although the issues flagged did not have to do with third-party apps. In 2017, Helen Dixon told the Irish parliamentary committee that Facebook \"did not agree with the recommendation\" for significant changes to its privacy rules in 2011, and that the changes were made only through an \"iterative process\" 18 months later.</p><p>Facebook disputes that account.</p><p>In comments to POLITICO, a spokesperson said that the company had \"complied fully\" with all requested changes, and claimed that the Irish regulator had never requested any changes that would have prevented the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Hawkes, who at the time was the top Irish regulator, declined to comment on the matter, according to a spokeswoman at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a nonprofit association that brings together people working on data protection. Gary Davis did not respond to repeated requests for comment and a spokesperson for Apple, where Davis now works, did not respond.</p><p>The years that followed Davis' audit brought Facebook's relationship with Ireland to new levels of closeness.</p><p>In 2013, the commission dismissed Schrems' claim against the company over data transfers to the United States, calling the suit frivolous. The company then won an award of funds from Ireland's national asset management agency - the so-called \"bad bank\" that took over assets on troubled lenders during the financial crisis - to build its Frank Gehry-designed headquarters in Dublin.</p><p>When the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in 2018, the U.K. launched an investigation and fined the company, while Ireland merely issued recommendations. A few months after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the U.S. Congress and European Parliament to answer questions from lawmakers, the company announced the construction of a new 14-acre campus in Dublin and the opening of several new data centers in County Meath, north of Dublin.</p><p>As far back as 2014, the question of how Ireland would handle the new privacy rules under the GDPR was on the minds of Facebook's leaders. As it happened, Ireland was in the process of choosing a new chief data regulator to replace Hawkes. Sandberg took it on herself to investigate the matter, lobbying then Irish Prime Minister Kenny on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos and also at her offices in Menlo Park, Calif.</p><p>According to emails obtained by the Irish Independent via Freedom of Information requests, Sandberg wanted to know that Hawkes' successor would be \"as strong as\" he had been in the role. But if the wrong choice was made, Sandberg suggested, there would be consequences for Ireland's attractiveness as a destination for tech investment.</p><p>\"The risk is that companies will revisit their investment strategies for the EU market,\" she wrote in a June, 2014, email to Kenny, adding that Ireland's regulator should be a person who would \"establish a strong collaborative working relationship with companies like ours.\"</p><p>The choice of Dixon, a former Irish civil servant with a law degree but no background in law enforcement or regulatory investigation, was in line with Sandberg's wishes. Before she became one of the most important privacy regulators in the world, Dixon had spent four years working for U.S. software company Citrix, followed by a stint at the business-friendly Irish Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.</p><p>While the regulator's statutes called for the appointment of three co-equal directors in order to properly separate the agency's enforcement and adjudication roles, the other two were never named.</p><p>TJ McIntyre, a law professor at University College Dublin who sued the government over the process under which Dixon was chosen, complained that she's \"not coming from that investigatory and enforcement perspective.\"</p><p>Instead, he said, Dixon was chosen to supervise the DPC's development into a more substantial regulator than the one housed above a convenience store in Portarlington, building a bureaucratic structure rather than targeting specific issues.</p><p>In speeches and interviews, Dixon has emphasized the need to engage with tech companies to help them understand the law, rather than cultivate adversarial relationships.</p><p>\"We are very committed to this approach of engaging with the multinationals,\" she told the Irish Times in 2016. \"We do firmly believe the way in which we work with them produces much better safeguards for data subjects.\"</p><p>That approach yields good results in terms of compliance, said Bojana Bellamy, who runs the Centre for Information Policy Leadership, an industry-backed privacy think tank whose members include Facebook and Apple.</p><p>\"I do believe that constructive engagement is incredibly important to build that trust,\" she said. \"Sticks and enforcement - that doesn't create the best behavior in the marketplace.\"</p><p>Ireland's more conciliatory approach is now fueling tension with other EU regulators. After France's data watchdog fined Google (EURO)50 million in January for failing to comply with GDPR, Germany's prominent Hamburg data regulator told the regulatory-analysis publication MLex that Ireland should be investigating the company. In a separate statement to POLITICO, the German watchdog underscored \"differences\" in the way Irish and German authorities interpreted and enforced EU rules, singling out \"face recognition techniques by Facebook\" and the \"exchange of data between WhatsApp and Facebook.\"</p><p>\"Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to set up the data protection we have enforced in national court proceedings against Facebook at the EU level,\" wrote professor Johannes Caspar, head of the Hamburg regulator. \"After the transmission of user data between WhatsApp and Facebook was stopped, they [Facebook] took the entry into force of the GDPR as an opportunity to return to their former practice.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg's announcement of plans to merge WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram messaging were also \"reason for concern,\" added Caspar, echoing the German Justice Ministry's warning that such a merger would create a \"monopoly\" and call for enforcement of European antitrust rules.</p><p>While the Irish regulator said it would examine the implications of such a merger, France echoed the German concerns.</p><p>\"In general, in relation to Facebook, you have a pattern where other regulatory authorities have been much more active and found themselves thwarted by the fact that Facebook was headquartered in Ireland,\" said McIntyre, adding that \"enforcement has been lax.\"</p><p>Jimmy Stewart, an adjunct professor of finance at Trinity Business School at Trinity College Dublin, said less rigorous regulation is part of Ireland's strategy.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Twitter and other companies like them make their money by harvesting vast amounts of data on users that is used to target them more precisely with advertising. Thanks to the data collected on Facebook, an advertiser can pinpoint categories of users down to hyper-minute criteria including their age, sexual orientation, health issues or political beliefs. This technology has allowed tech platforms to corner the global market for online advertising, turning them into juggernauts worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>But those dollars could disappear if regulators interfere with the tech giants' ability to collect and hold that information.</p><p>\"Regulatory arbitrage is an important part of the country's arsenal\" to attract tech companies \"along with tax incentives,\" Stewart said.</p><p>Ireland's handling of new technologies such as Facebook's facial recognition tool will go a long way toward determining how seriously it intends to scrutinize tech companies.</p><p>Last spring, just as the GDPR was about to take effect, Facebook prepared to reintroduce its banned facial recognition tool, this time promising to ask users if they wanted the tool switched on, so that the platform could match their names to photographs of them posted by friends online. But when senior executives, including Chief Data Protection Officer Stephen Deadman, disclosed the plans to a small group of privacy specialists and journalists in Dublin, the meeting did not go exactly as planned, according to multiple participants who asked not to be named out of respect for the meeting's private nature.</p><p>The journalists and privacy watchdogs peppered the executives with questions about whether the tool violated GDPR principles, suggesting that Facebook may be unlawfully \"processing\" biometric data on users even if they chose to opt out of the tool, because the data was being gathered and stored anyway - a process that would go against GDPR rules.</p><p>\"They are analyzing every photograph, even those where they don't have permission, and their argument is this is not processing biometric data because they don't take the final step of identifying the person,\" said Dublin-based privacy lawyer Simon McGarr. \"From a privacy standpoint, this is cloud cuckoo land.\"</p><p>After a brief exchange, Facebook executives ended the meeting stating that they needed to catch planes, the participants said.</p><p>Facebook representatives told POLITICO last year that the meeting had gone as planned. They also said they had discussed the facial recognition tool with the Irish Data Protection Commission and not been informed of any concerns. Yet Doyle contradicted that account, saying that while no initiative was taken to halt the rollout, an \"examination\" - as distinct from a statutory investigation - was launched.</p><p>\"It is standard practice to conduct an examination on this basis to determine whether a statutory investigation is warranted,\" Doyle said in his email. \"In the case of FB's facial recognition facility, that determination has not yet been made.\"</p><p>In the following months, Facebook was rocked by a series of scandals, data breaches and PR disasters that included Zuckerberg being grilled by lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, and The New York Times revealing the firm had hired a public relations firm to attack critics, including by such dubious tactics as linking them to Hungarian-born investor George Soros.</p><p>Yet in Ireland, the going was relatively quiet. In early October, the commission announced the launch of its first official investigation of Facebook, over a data breach that compromised the private messages and data of an estimated 50 million users. The commission has since disclosed it is carrying a total of seven investigations into Facebook, which Dixon told Bloomberg were all \"substantially advanced,\" and should lead to the first decisions being taken in \"June or July.\"</p><p>However, as of late October, it had yet to send any officers to visit Facebook's Irish headquarters and was receiving its information mainly via \"updates\" from the company, which often coincided with its disclosures to the public, a person close to the matter said. Asked whether any visits had taken place, both Facebook and the commission said such visits had taken place \"in the past\" but did not specify whether any had taken place in the past year. The last publicly disclosed site visits took place in 2011, under Billy Hawkes.</p><p>\"We visit companies being audited or investigated when we need to, and regular meetings often take place in the normal course of our supervised engagement with companies at their premises,\" Doyle said. \"Such visits have taken place to Facebook Ireland's offices in the past but we won't be disclosing any details on these for operational reasons.\"</p><p>For Daragh O'Brien, whose Castlebridge consultancy routinely carries out privacy audits on companies, not sending an officer to Facebook is the equivalent of \"police investigating a crime from the doughnut shop.\"</p><p>\"You miss the opportunity for someone to grab you and tell you something they can't do in writing ... It happens all the time, especially in the context of complex investigations,\" he said.</p><p>Asked whether it intends to launch any probes into data-sharing by the various networks controlled by Google, the commission said that it gained jurisdiction over the search giant only on Jan. 22 and still is not the lead supervisory authority for Google's search engine and indexing service.</p><p>But Caspar, the German regulatory chief, said that Ireland had a responsibility to investigate any privacy complaint lodged in the European Union. (Google is appealing the French fine. In previous comments to POLITICO, a spokesperson for Google said the company had been under no legal obligation in 2018 to finalize the steps for its \"main establishment\" in the European Union.)</p><p>As for the scandals that rocked Facebook over the past year, Doyle pointed to the commission's limited mandate as a regulator of data security as a reason to defer action or public communications. The spread of hate speech and the use of micro-targeting for online political advertising - both of which have been identified as major areas of concern by the European Commission - are outside its purview as a data regulator, Doyle said.</p><p>Yet such an interpretation of the regulator's role and responsibility does not sit well with privacy professionals. In addition to being responsible for compliance with data protection statutes, Dixon and her staff have an \"ethical duty\" to lead debates on where and how regulation should be applied in response to emerging issues, O'Brien said.</p><p>\"It's not just about the letter of the law, but also anticipating where problems may be coming from,\" he said, adding that the next big problems would crop up if and when facial recognition technology is combined with targeted ads to beam commercial messages at people in public spaces. \"The sort of scandals and breaches we've seen over the past few years are just a prelude to what may be coming as 5G [next generation] networks come online.\"</p><p>I'm continuing to report on data privacy issues with Big Tech.

While the economy tanked because of the pandemic, the four companies reported a combined profit of US$28.6 billion in the second quarter.</p><p>As a group, their market value is now around US$5 trillion, making them the most valued companies in the world.</p><p>Traditional antitrust measures are not a feasible solution for taming Big Tech's market power in the data-driven economy. This is because they do not address the source of these firms' power: data.</p><p>An effective way to create a more competitive data-driven economy is to make user data easily accessible to anyone with a legitimate purpose. Data usage may be controlled by a strict regulatory regime modelled on securities regulation that protects the integrity and anonymity of publicly available data.</p><p>Bigger, richer, more powerful</p><p>The networks these firms provide and the data they collect make them the best at selling access to consumers. If all your friends are on Facebook, you have to be on the platform if you want them to see what you're doing and thinking and vice versa. If Amazon is where you can find the most products to buy online, that's where you're going to shop.</p><p>It's also where merchants are going to want to sell their products to you. You want to search for something on the web, you go to Google, because everyone uses Google.</p><p>As the number of people using online products and services grows, companies collect larger amounts of data about them, their preferences and their behaviour. This translates to a more tailored experience to meet people's specific needs, wishes and interests, which leads to more people joining the network and further data generation.</p><p>More people and data mean more money, which means more acquisitions of potential competitors or their technology, thereby adding further people and data to a network.</p><p>Taming Big Tech's power, restoring competition</p><p>Traditional antitrust approaches such as breaking up Big Tech firms and preventing potential competitor acquisitions are never-ending processes. Even if you break them up and block their ability to acquire other, smaller tech firms, Big Tech will start growing again because of network effects and their data advantage.</p><p>And how do we know when a tech firm is big enough to ensure competitive markets? What are the size or scope thresholds for breaking up firms or blocking mergers and acquisitions?</p><p>A small startup acquired for millions of dollars can be worth billions of dollars for a Big Tech acquirer once integrated in its ecosystem. A series of small acquisitions can result in a dominant position in one area of the digital economy. Knowing this, competition/antitrust authorities would potentially have to examine every tech transaction, however small.</p><p>Not only would this be administratively costly or burdensome on resources, but it would also be difficult for government officials to assess with some precision (and therefore legitimacy), the likely future economic impact of an acquisition in a rapidly evolving technological environment.</p><p>Open data access, level the playing field</p><p>Given that mass data collection is at the core of Big Tech's power as gatekeepers to customers, a key solution is to open up data access for other firms so that they can compete better.</p><p>Anonymized data (to protect an individual's privacy rights) about people's behaviour, interests, views, etc., should be made available for free to anyone wanting to pursue a commercial or non-commercial endeavour. Data about a firm's operations or performance would, however, remain private.</p><p>Using an analogy from the finance world, Big Tech firms act as insider traders. Stock market insiders often possess insider (or private) information about companies that the public does not have. Such individuals then have an incentive to profit by buying or selling shares in those companies before the public becomes aware of the information.</p><p>Big Tech's incentives are no different than stock market insiders. They trade on exclusively available private information (data) to generate extraordinary profits.</p><p>Continuing the finance analogy, financial securities regulators forbid the use of inside or non-publicly available information for personal benefit. Individuals found to illegally use such information are punished with jail time and fines.</p><p>They also require companies to publicly report relevant information that affects or could significantly affect their performance. Finally, they oblige insiders to publicly report when they buy and sell shares in a company in which they have access to privileged information.</p><p>Transposing stock market insider trading regulation to Big Tech implies that data access and use should be monitored under an independent regulatory body - call it a Data Market Authority. Such a body would be responsible for setting and enforcing principles, rules and standards of behaviour among individuals and organizations in the data-driven economy.</p><p>For example, a Data Market Authority would require firms to publicly report how they acquire and use personal data. It would prohibit personal data hoarding by ensuring that data is easily portable from one platform, network or marketplace to another. It would also prohibit the buying and selling of personal data as well as protect individuals' privacy by imposing penalties on firms and individuals in cases of non-compliance.</p><p>Data openly and freely available under a strict regulatory environment would likely be a better way to tame Big Tech's power than breaking them up and having antitrust authorities approving every acquisition that they wish to make.</p><p>___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The hearing was part of the subcommittee's 13-month investigation of Big Tech's market power and anti-competitive practices.Remarkably, the next day, the four companies announced stellar quarterly financial results , beating analysts' expectations. While the economy tanked because of the pandemic, the four companies reported a combined profit of US$28.6 billion in the second quarter. As a group, their market value is now around US$5 trillion , making them the most valued companies in the world.Traditional antitrust measures are not a feasible solution for taming Big Tech's market power in the data-driven economy. This is because they do not address the source of these firms' power: data. </p><p>An effective way to create a more competitive data-driven economy is to make user data easily accessible to anyone with a legitimate purpose. Data usage may be controlled by a strict regulatory regime modelled on securities regulation that protects the integrity and anonymity of publicly available data.Bigger, richer, more powerfulThe networks these firms provide and the data they collect make them the best at selling access to consumers. If all your friends are on Facebook, you have to be on the platform if you want them to see what you're doing and thinking and vice versa. If Amazon is where you can find the most products to buy online, that's where you're going to shop. It's also where merchants are going to want to sell their products to you. You want to search for something on the web, you go to Google, because everyone uses Google.<br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifying remotely during a House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust on Capitol Hill on July 29, 2020, in Washington. (Mandel Ngan/Pool via AP) As the number of people using online products and services grows, companies collect larger amounts of data about them, their preferences and their behaviour. This translates to a more tailored experience to meet people's specific needs, wishes and interests, which leads to more people joining the network and further data generation. More people and data mean more money, which means more acquisitions of potential competitors or their technology, thereby adding further people and data to a network.Taming Big Tech's power, restoring competition Traditional antitrust approaches such as breaking up Big Tech firms and preventing potential competitor acquisitions are never-ending processes. Even if you break them up and block their ability to acquire other, smaller tech firms, Big Tech will start growing again because of network effects and their data advantage.And how do we know when a tech firm is big enough to ensure competitive markets? What are the size or scope thresholds for breaking up firms or blocking mergers and acquisitions?<br/>Big Tech leaders: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, Evan Vucci, Jeff Chiu, Jens Meyer) A small startup acquired for millions of dollars can be worth billions of dollars for a Big Tech acquirer once integrated in its ecosystem. A series of small acquisitions can result in a dominant position in one area of the digital economy. Knowing this, competition/antitrust authorities would potentially have to examine every tech transaction, however small.Not only would this be administratively costly or burdensome on resources, but it would also be difficult for government officials to assess with some precision (and therefore legitimacy), the likely future economic impact of an acquisition in a rapidly evolving technological environment.Open data access, level the playing fieldGiven that mass data collection is at the core of Big Tech's power as gatekeepers to customers, a key solution is to open up data access for other firms so that they can compete better.Anonymized data (to protect an individual's privacy rights) about people's behaviour, interests, views, etc., should be made available for free to anyone wanting to pursue a commercial or non-commercial endeavour. Data about a firm's operations or performance would, however, remain private. Using an analogy from the finance world, Big Tech firms act as insider traders. Stock market insiders often possess insider (or private) information about companies that the public does not have. Such individuals then have an incentive to profit by buying or selling shares in those companies before the public becomes aware of the information. Big Tech's incentives are no different than stock market insiders. They trade on exclusively available private information (data) to generate extraordinary profits.<br/>A stock trader, left, adjusts his mask as he enters the New York Stock Exchange the day soaring profits were reported by Big Tech companies. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Continuing the finance analogy, financial securities regulators forbid the use of inside or non-publicly available information for personal benefit. Individuals found to illegally use such information are punished with jail time and fines . They also require companies to publicly report relevant information that affects or could significantly affect their performance. Finally, they oblige insiders to publicly report when they buy and sell shares in a company in which they have access to privileged information.Transposing stock market insider trading regulation to Big Tech implies that data access and use should be monitored under an independent regulatory body \u2014 call it a Data Market Authority. Such a body would be responsible for setting and enforcing principles, rules and standards of behaviour among individuals and organizations in the data-driven economy.For example, a Data Market Authority would require firms to publicly report how they acquire and use personal data. It would prohibit personal data hoarding by ensuring that data is easily portable from one platform, network or marketplace to another. It would also prohibit the buying and selling of personal data as well as protect individuals' privacy by imposing penalties on firms and individuals in cases of non-compliance.Data openly and freely available under a strict regulatory environment would likely be a better way to tame Big Tech's power than breaking them up and having antitrust authorities approving every acquisition that they wish to make.<br/>MENAFN0508202001990000ID1100593000</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1100593000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HR-67D1-F04Y-T39Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1112\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As technology has developed, so has its ability to drive efficiency, boost business, improve customer experience, and deliver more succinct, targeted strategies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digitisation has stopped being an IT responsibility, and moved firmly into the CEO and CFOs' offices, such has become its profound and all-encompassing impact on businesses today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A key component of this digital transformation is the cloud \u2013 a platform that can encompass data storage and analysis, computing power, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software as a service, and much more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the main players in the Gulf region \u2013 and across the world \u2013 in rolling out</p><p>cloud services is Oracle. Through</p><p>its cloud offering, the tech giant</p><p>has provided organisations with tailored solutions to their technology and business needs.</p><p>But as Arun Khehar, Oracle's senior vice president of business applications for the Middle East, Africa and India, explains when we meet at the company's regional HQ in Dubai, the past 18 to 24 months have seen a shift in what Oracle can do for its customers.</p><p>\"Our journey into the cloud started three and a half years back \u2013 that's really when we took our first baby steps and started looking at customers who had individual requirements,\" he says.</p><p>What I mean by that is very</p><p>targeted requirements in HR, or</p><p>CX [customer experience], or</p><p>budgeting and planning, or just financials. They wanted to understand what cloud was, they wanted to know the piece that they could digest and run with before taking a decision on bigger things.</p><p>\"Now our customers are looking at the whole piece. They are saying 'if I take one piece of cloud, that does not give me the value that I am looking for'. Previously they got the value, they saw the difference, they saw the speed of implementation, and they also understood they do not need to take ownership in IT anymore \u2013 they could outsource as much as possible. Now, in these last six or seven quarters, we have seen customers connect end-to- end on the cloud.</p><p>\"The one key thinking behind it was 'how do I bring the total cost of ownership down by a huge percentage'. We're talking about 35 to 45 per cent, depending on different types of customers. They wanted to get rid of their data centres and outsource their entire IT platform to Oracle.\"</p><p>As digitAl trAnsformAtion becomes increAsingly importAnt to the region's business community, orAcle's senior vice president of business ApplicAtions for</p><p>the middle eAst, AfricA And indiA, Arun KhehAr, explAins how the tech giAnt is helping orgAnisAtions step up to the next level through the cloud</p><p>And the SVP can point to some pretty impressive companies that are taking the lead in making these bigger, bolder changes.</p><p>\"We have in retail Apparel Group that started the</p><p>full piece of outsourced to Oracle. Then there are the Aldars of the world, and many others. They're across different industries, and not just in the private sector; we have public sector too. And it has triggered a new set of expectations from the market.</p><p>\"A great example of what I'm saying is Emaar. Emaar has been a customer for 14 or 15 years, basically since they started. Here we had a customer that had X number of properties, X number of assets, and X number of people 15 years back. The company grew, became the</p><p>largest property company in the world outside China, and with that the requirements grew, the shareholders' expectations grew, the complexity grew, and real estate changed around the world, as well as in Dubai.</p><p>\"So cost of ownership, governance, compliance, speed, competitiveness, real estate changes, and the new requirements in the real estate market \u2013 all that made Emaar talk to Oracle and say 'we had what we had, which was great for the last 10 to 12 years; now we want to see how you can transform our business in the new digitised world, which has different expectations and requirements'.</p><p>\"</p><p>\"We had to do a complete mapping of what the company had, what they needed, what the market had, and what</p><p>the market needed, as well as what the expectations were from Emaar. We created a solution and a roadmap for \u2013 it was a long exercise and took us a few quarters. We brought in domain experts, architects, industry experts from Oracle to help them see how the CFO role would connect with the new Oracle implementation.</p><p>\"What we did for Emaar is a summary of what we</p><p>do for all the other customers, and we're doing this across industries. The next big challenge that we will</p><p>see more of, and we look forward to that, is the entire government of this region taking the journey and taking the transformation.\"</p><p>Spotlight on the C-suite</p><p>Khehar explains that as part of the Emaar digital transformation, Oracle worked closely with the real estate giant's CFO, highlighting another important development in the cloud landscape.</p><p>\"The roles of chief financial officer, chief executive officer, and chief operating officer have become very, very critical in this phase,\" he says.</p><p>\"IT over the years has matured. The issue is not about technology any more \u2013 that's the key difference. If you look at why a CFO or CEO would take such decisions, it's because the market \u2013 the compliance, governance and the regulations of the market \u2013 has made the role of CEO and CFO different.</p><p>\"Now they have to report in a certain way, and</p><p>the numbers have to be driven by certain guidelines</p><p>that weren't there 10-15 years back, or at least not as important as they used to be 10-15 years back. So I think that is driving it.\"</p><p>With new technology changing the way businesses operate, and with a new group of executives needing to understand what cloud, AI, blockchain, and other tech means for their organisation, Oracle has also taken on the role of educator \u2013 helping companies, especially their leadership, understand how and why new tech can make an impact for them.</p><p>\"We are doing a lot of education, bringing that into organisations to show them the value,\" says Khehar.</p><p>\"Today's CFOs, CEOs and business heads need a lot more assistance than before. What do you do? Where do you go? What do you believe should be the right decisions to take?</p><p>\"For example, we show them that we have artificial intelligence directly connected to security, with automation done around blockchain, which is built</p><p>into our applications today. We have the autonomous database, and you have to remember that the database is the heart of all this. If you don't fix the heart, your organisation will collapse somewhere or other. So you need autonomous to compute for you. It's automatic, so it computes it for you, it repairs it for you, and secures you.\"</p><p>And giving potential new customers the inside track</p><p>of what Oracle can do \u2013 and why it's important \u2013 has paid dividends for both sides.</p><p>\"Apparel Group is a good example,\" says Khehar.</p><p>\"They had nothing in Oracle, and the meetings we had were basically looking at their new requirements.</p><p>\"The visionary owners were very clear that their</p><p>core business is to run retail; they don't want to make themselves an IT shop. So they were looking for a partner who could take care of their technology, who could take care of their business, their expansions, while they focus on what they know best, which is retail.</p><p>\"The systems they had in place before we met them would not allow them to grow the number of stores beyond 10-20 per cent at that time. Now they've grown something like 200 or 300 per cent since. And the growth was directly connected to the IT they had in place.\"</p><p>Digital or bust</p><p>With so many benefits to those implementing new technologies, digitising their business, and partnering with experts such as Oracle, Khehar believes organisations that are slow on the uptake could suffer dire consequences.</p><p>\"If you're not automated with the right tools, if you don't have the right security in place, if you don't have all the artificial intelligence-based applications coming in, I think you're going to run out of speed,\" he argues.</p><p>And it's not just a private sector challenge. Public sector bodies around the world are also on the line when it comes to digitisation, though Khehar believes this is one particular area in which GCC governments have taken a leading step.</p><p>\"We work very closely with the governments and we align ourselves to their strategies,\" he says.</p><p>\"As we speak, we are working with them on many fronts. One is to look at individual departments, individual ministries, to see what we can do there. And some of them have taken steps already to automate their HR, or their CX, or their budgeting and planning. And now, with the investments we made in the region with the datacenter, the rest of it is falling in place.\"</p><p>The data centre, opened in Abu Dhabi earlier this year, was the first in the Middle East, offering cloud storage to customers across the region.</p><p>Designed to better manage service levels and respond to local customers who need to keep their data local, Khehar explains that one of the main benefits of the facility has been peace of mind.</p><p>\"It's brought more comfort \u2013 I think that's the biggest piece of it,\" he says.</p><p>\"Some customers had this more as a kind of a checklist thing: Is there a data centre in the region? Yes, it's there. Okay, check \u2013 we give Oracle a green light.</p><p>\"But actually a lot of our customers are very happy with our global data centres. They are very happy that we give them the comfort of European data centres, American data centres, Singaporean data centres; we cover our customers globally. In the Middle East we have the UAE now and we have Saudi coming up.</p><p>\"So we've given them the extra comfort of giving them the whole piece, including the data centre.\"</p><p>Long-term investments</p><p>The data centre is a prime example of how Oracle is investing in the future of the region and its businesses. But it's certainly not the only one.</p><p>\"We have also trained and brought more skills into the country,\" explains Khehar.</p><p>\"Today's cfos, ceos and business heads need a loT more assisTance Than before. whaT do you do? where do you go? whaT should be The righT decisions</p><p>To TaKe?\"</p><p>ORACLE</p><p>\"if you're noT auTomaTed wiTh The righT Tools, The righT securiTy in place, if you don'T haVe The ai- based applicaTions coming in, you're going To run ouT of speed.\"</p><p>\"For example, we have just finished training 500-plus Emirati students on the latest technology from Oracle \u2013 artificial intelligence, blockchain, and so on. These guys are going to go into the job environment in the next few quarters and hopefully use our technologies to improve the way they do business. So that is happening.</p><p>\"And our investments keep growing. We're bringing more people into the country and exports into the region, we're training our partners, and we're taking</p><p>a lot more ownership than we did in the past. That's something that is very critical.</p><p>\"In the good old days, Oracle \u2013 and our competitors</p><p>\u2013 would come in, sell the CD, and then let the customer decide what they wanted to do with implementation. Not anymore. One of the key benefits of the cloud is that we have a stake, we have skin in the game, throughout the journey that Oracle has with each customer.</p><p>\"So we sell you the technology, we implement that technology for you, we do all the business analysis that goes with it, the ROI that goes with it, and we run that for you in our data centres. We take ownership of the upgrades, we take ownership of the security, and any issue that comes up, there's only one person responsible and that is us.\"</p><p>The SVP adds that Oracle will continue investing</p><p>in people across the region in the coming months, and will bring more products and innovations into its data centres. Meanwhile, big events such as Open World Dubai, which debuted this year, will continue to take place in the region \"to bring awareness to people who cannot travel to our international events\".</p><p>There is also the growth of Oracle's digital hub for SMEs to consider, as well as its Future Ready Lab, which exhibits the power of technology to customers, and allows them to work on new ideas.</p><p>\"They can come in here, sit with our guys, and create solutions for them based around our technologies,\" says Khehar.</p><p>And while all this is taking place in the background, there have also been some substantial moves that signal a new way for big tech companies to work.</p><p>In June, Oracle announced a partnership with</p><p>fellow tech giant Microsoft that would allow cloud interoperability, enabling customers to migrate and run workloads across Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.</p><p>With the partnership being rolled out in Ashburn in the US first, the new system will be available in the Gulf later in the year.</p><p>\"It's all with the customer in mind,\" says Khehar. \"There are customers of ours who want to do certain</p><p>things around our product with Microsoft, and this collaboration will give them that additional choice. So I think it's good. It gives the customer a choice and to reuse the dollars that they've spent internally.</p><p>\"We've taken the right steps there, and more will come on in the next few quarters.There's a lot of good stuff that they do, especially in analytics, so we can capitalise on that on our platform.\"</p><p>Something else Oracle is capitalising on is geography, with the Middle East viewed as a critical region by the company. But as Khehar explains as our conversation draws to a close, so strong are the cloud's capabilities, companies can now afford to think a lot more globally.</p><p>\"We create the discipline, the guidelines, and the references here, and then we see a lot of countries follow this,\" he says.</p><p>\"What we do here is not just about the Middle East, especially as a lot of our customers are global. Landmark Group, for example. Whatever they do here they also do in India. Apparel \u2013 they do it in Middle East and Africa. Alshaya, they have the Eastern Bloc in Europe.</p><p>\"Kuwaiti and Saudi customers have a global presence. We sold to a customer in Saudi recently who owns plantations in Argentina. Our reach is beyond imagination today, so what we're trying to set and sell here is going to have a huge impact, probably across 20, 30 countries.</p><p>\"And that's the beauty of the cloud. Because as long as you get internet there, it will run.</p><p>\"So I think our stories are going to get more global out of this region.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GBUSAB-148620959</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GBUSAB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHB-CJ11-F11P-X3TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">357133</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2373\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Motivate Publishing.

Polyient Labs CEO Brad Robertson outlines how they can clear that hurdle.There are those who still associate blockchain[1] technology - decentralized, transparent immutable digital ledgers - with only two things: Bitcoin and hype. The hype is undeniable, but hype is a natural outcome of mass adoption, and blockchain is being used by an array of multibillion-dollar organizations[2] to meet a myriad of needs - everything from marketing[3] and identity protection[4] to supply chain management[5], cannabis funding[6] and mitigating world hunger[7]. Here is another early-stage blockchain idea to add to the list of blockchain use cases: deploying blockchain to help third-party vendors and service providers keep up with the ever-changing compliance demands and security requirements of their corporate clients. Right now, U.S.-based multinationals spend as much as 12 percent of their annual revenue keeping up with compliance requirements. </p><p>And, according to a recent accenture survey[8], most of them anticipate compliance-related costs are only going to escalate. This should come as no surprise when the regulatory tick sheet is examined. In the 1950s, the list of federal regulations U.S.-based businesses had to abide by filled 10 pages. In 2017, that list[9] exceeded 180 pages. For most U.S. corporations, this is simply the cost of doing business. However, it's a different story for the millions of service providers and third-party vendors that work with - and depend on - corporate clients. By law, service providers, contractors and vendors must meet the same compliance benchmarks their enterprise partners do. But in the majority of cases, these smaller organizations must do so with a fraction of the financial and human resources corporations can throw at the problem. Small service providers must mirror the same hiring and training practices, the same data-security and risk-management policies, the same audit schedules. When a corporation makes technical upgrades, vendors are expected to as well. When enterprises introduce a new 'corporate sustainability policy' or 'cyber risk initiative,' contractors are expected to follow suit. It's little wonder that, according to the National Small Business Association,[10] in its first year of business, the typical startup shoulders more than $83,000 in regulatory costs. After that, according to the nonprofit OCEG, it's common for third-party organizations to spend between $15,000 and $250,000 each year keeping pace with enterprise-client requirements. Why are small providers pressured to operate with the same governance, risk and compliance (GRC) standards as the mega-corporations they serve? Because corporations are accountable for the actions and behavior of the vendors they hire. As Drew Hendricks explained in Inc. in 2017[11]: 'While vendors may be entirely separate from the organization, if they commit violations on behalf of the company in question, that company can also become liable.' Unfortunately, the costs associated with keeping up with the regulators is the responsibility of the vendors - regardless of their size. GlobalScape confirmed this three years ago[12]: 'larger companies have access to leading data protection technologies and highly-skilled personnel [with] expertise in data protection laws and regulations,' the organization concluded. 'When adjusted by headcount compliance costs are highest for organizations with fewer than 1,000 employees.' In most cases, the 'compliance costs' manifest themselves in the form of 200-page questionnaires - or 'vendor security assessments' - required by the enterprise organizations. Vendor security assessments typically require input from across an organization, covering everything from training and SOC certifications to security audits to HR standards to 'sustainability practices.' Completing them is an arduous, time-consuming, expensive - and recurring - chore. When faced with these documents, most smaller vendors are forced to choose between two pathways: They either add additional staff, such as CISOs or CSOs, or they work with expensive consultants to ensure they are operating in lock-step with their corporate clients' wishes. (There is a third, increasingly-more common option: simply declining to pursue lucrative corporate contracts.) Blockchain offers a fourth option: the technology can be used to help small vendors identify and keep pace with all of the requirements corporate clients demand. In recent months, I've been working with Scott Mitchell, chairman of OCEG and founder of Grayframe, a startup that's exploring the use of blockchain in GRC. Together, we've been exploring use cases to determine the feasibility of deploying blockchain to help vendors and corporations improve their working relationships. So far, our findings confirm blockchain can give vendors an edge: access to a decentralized ledger where internal stakeholders can log compliance updates in real time. Instead of circulating 200-page questionnaires, company execs can record all important events on an immutable ledger. Every new policy that is adopted, each new security upgrade, every certification that is earned can all be recorded in real time on a compliance blockchain. Conversely, corporations can use the same technology to identify their compliance requirements on a public blockchain. Before a vendor even devotes time and manpower to completing an RFP, an executive can consult the ledger, review the compliance requirements of the large enterprise and calculate the cost and feasibility of winning the contract. Used correctly, blockchain can quickly and accurately identify enterprise requirements giving vendors the tools they need to complete vendor security assessments and win enterprise contracts.

In addition, they will help banks increase profits through data analytics and protect their customers' valuable data through software security.Many of these financial services organizations are turning to offshore software outsourcing[3] to build custom software while maintaining a lean in-house development team. That's because these companies come with decades of invaluable experience from working with big tech and other Fortune 500 companies to develop custom software.Banks are turning to offshore development services to access the best talent. </p><p>This is especially important given the stranglehold that big tech has over software development talent and the historically low unemployment rate[4] enjoyed by software developers, which has increased salaries and competition for the entire industry.In addition, offshore development teams are being used to shorten the development cycle and improve the quality of data analytics in the industry. Read on to learn more about how software outsourcing is shaping the future of fintech and helping companies grow. 1. Access to in-demand experts Offshore software outsourcing companies help financial service organizations find the right talent for their development needs. This is especially important given the current hiring market - software engineers have an ultralow unemployment rate of just 1.9%[5].This candidate-driven job market means that more companies are competing to hire a limited number of experienced software engineers. Hiring for the fintech industry is even more difficult, since working in finance has historically been viewed as less prestigiousthan working for well-recognized tech companies[6] like Google or Facebook. Furthermore, while the tech talent crisis may have started in the United States, it's beginning to affectcompanies across the world[7], including ones in Western Europe and Canada.That's why businesses across the globe are turning to offshore development companies to avoid the tough American hiring market and secure the right talent for their needs.Many of these companies are located in regions like Latin America and Asia, which have an excess of experienced software developers with the same education and experience levels as their American counterparts.Software engineers in Latin America are also valued for their advanced fluency in English and understanding of American tech culture. Developers in this region also work the same business hours as their in-house colleagues, making collaboration seamless. 2. Faster project completion Fintech companies are working with offshore software development firms in order to start projects quicker and complete them in less time.Financial service firms have long used traditional hiring processes to staff their software development projects. This involves finding candidates through traditional hiring channels and training those new employees to company standards. However, offshore development services have a range of experienced developers on staff who can start a project on cue, eliminating the time-consuming hiring process.These specialists can also shorten the development lifecycle. That's because these developers have years of experience as contractors and have worked on a wide variety of projects over their careers. They can apply this experience to quickly resolve common problems, streamline the most complex parts of the development cycle and reduce the overall length of the project.Finally, the type of multidisciplinary development teams favored by outsourcing companies allow for the rapid development of high-quality software. That's because they include important considerations like user design, quality assurance and data privacy in every step of the development process. This eliminates much of the workload at the tail end of the project and results in a superior final product. 3. Increased profits through data analytics The finance industry is a leader in data collection and analytics. Investment banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have long employed specialists who analyze data to reduce risk when underwriting loans, issuing securities or trading futures.These same financial service organizations are now analyzing consumer data[8] to increase sales and promote customer loyalty. They use credit scores, spending habits, and demographic data to analyze creditworthiness and offer tailored services to each consumer.Both small credit unions and large multinational banks are utilizing a combination of in-house engineers and offshore development services to improve their analytics. In particular, these offshore software outsourcing services help financial institutions build data analytics software with the popular Python programming language[9]. They also help companies protect valuable consumer data by providing experienced software security experts as needed. 4. Reduced server load through cloud computing The banking and finance industry has been reluctant to implement cloud computing technology, largely because web-based storage is vulnerable to hackers. However, recent improvements in data privacy protections have led some banks to begin integrating the technology[10]into their core business.Financial institutions love cloud computing because it reduces the need for physical infrastructure. Rather than maintaining fleets of expensive servers, banks can now store information offsite with a third party through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) arrangement.That's one reasonresearchers estimate[11] that banks are cutting technology costs by 25% using cloud computing, saving more than $15 billion.Banks are alreadyusing cloud computing to store information related to communications, human resources and accounting. In fact, one of the most popular SaaS models is Microsoft Office 365, which allows companies to store documents, emails, calendars, contact lists and other sensitive information online. 5. Protection of valuable consumer data One of the most important challenges facing financial executives today is how to reduce the number of data breaches, whichincreases each year[12]. Furthermore, savvy cybercriminals levy an outsized portion of their attacks against the finance industry, attempting data breaches against banks 300 times more frequently[13] than companies in other industries - with each American financial service firm withstanding an estimated 1 billion attacks every year[14].This problem is even more important when you consider the type of information. Banks store incredibly sensitive data, including Social Security numbers, credit card information, salaries, purchase habits and home addresses. This is valuable information that criminals can usefor profit.Banks are responding to this crisis by increasing investments in their cybersecurity defenses and by hiring software security experts in droves. In fact, research has found[15] that financial institutions currently spend roughly $2,300 per person on cybersecurity every year. This spending accounts for nearly 15% of their information technology budgets.The U.S. government has released new regulations dictating howbanks should secure their information[16]. This means that banks of all sizes must continue to increase investments in data privacy and shore up their defenses against increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals. In summary The financial services industry is investing billions of dollars a year to develop the type of custom software that their businesses need to survive in the new data-driven marketplace. Many of these organizations are turning to offshore software outsourcing to accomplish this goal without distracting from their core missions.These offshore development services help banks develop well-crafted software without committing to large and unnecessary in-house engineering teams. In addition, outsourcing partners help businesses start projects quicker and shorten the overall development lifecycle.Finally, these offshore developers are improving the quality of data analytics for fintech. This will enable banks to offer targeted services to their customers and increase the quality of their investment banking operations.

Long before it was obvious that web platforms were hoovering up and selling everyone's personal information, creative professionals were battling Big Tech over copyright. We watched as our labour was snatched, grabbed and repurposed - for free - to create a few northern California billionaires, while the cultural economy tanked.</p><p>Consider how Facebook started.

And once copyright was rendered moot, Big Tech went after privacy.</p><p>All of which is why pushing back on unpermitted use of content by tech giants is a necessary first step to real and effective online regulation. The timing is great. Applying constraints, and demanding responsible behaviour online is suddenly fashionable. There's at least one front-running U.S. presidential candidate calling for the break-up of tech monopolies. As well, Europe has set a worldwide standard with the passage of its Copyright Directive and related digital regulations. The EU expects and demands both responsible behaviour from online giants, and fair payment to its creative professionals.</p><p>Here in Canada, a couple of the federal parties have inserted moderate and doable Internet regulation into their election platforms. Yet none of them have followed Europe's lead by putting copyright first. Which is surprising, considering Ottawa has spent the last year examining and reviewing our Copyright Act. Hundreds of hours of testimony from the cultural sector informed that review.</p><p>We even have a guidebook. A progressive, cross-party and far-reaching report, Shifting Paradigms, was produced last Spring by the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, recommending a fortification of the Copyright Act that would address the damage visited on the cultural economy over the last 20 years. Recommendations include combating piracy, new accountability for ISPs, a return to the licensing of content for those who have shunned payment, and the review and removal of over-broad exceptions to copyright that have been used to degrade it against international standards.</p><p>Everyone in Ottawa knows exactly what needs to be done to fix our Copyright Act. The Shifting Paradigms recommendations should be part of every party's platform.</p><p>That they are not is testament to the power of the Silicon Valley lobby. Big Tech fought hard against Europe's Copyright Directive, employing a mixture of scaremongering and disinformation. They claimed that fixing European copyright would render the Internet unworkable. They suggested paying for content would somehow lead to less content; protecting speech would somehow constrain free expression.</p><p>Well, I've just returned from Europe, and I'm happy to report the Internet is still on over there, there's tonnes of content and no end of free speech.</p><p>The same Big Tech bafflegab is thrown around Ottawa all the time, and it has clearly made our lawmakers nervous about copyright. Time to stiffen those spines. Strengthening the law protecting Canada's artists will not harm the Internet or free speech. It will improve the Internet for us all, and set the example needed to rein in the worst of privacy and data overreach as well. It will also redirect the flow of income, so less goes to California and more stays in Canada, with our artists, where it belongs.</p><p>Canada's cultural sector contributes more than $53 billion to the GDP and employs about 660,000 people. That foreign firms profit wildly from all that work, and that so much of it is grabbed for free from our workers, is a disgrace. Impoverishing the cultural sector diminishes our cities, where so much of this work takes place and is presented, feeding tourism and related industries. For instance, cultural work makes up a full eight per cent of Toronto's economic output. Imagine how much more we could do with a greater share of the profit from our own work.</p><p>For whomever forms the next government, online regulation is a fine priority. But they must start by implementing the Shifting Paradigms recommendations to repair Canada's Copyright Act.</p><p>John Degen is executive director of the Writers' Union of Canada and chair of the International Authors Forum in the U.K., serving and representing over 700,000 authors worldwide.

Today, Philadelphia residents simply expect the same convenience and accessibility managing their money as they do in any other aspect of their lives.</p><p>We have seen many industry sectors completely disrupted.</p><p>What about banking? Banks can survive and even thrive in the digital transformation, but only if they make the right moves.\u00a0</p><p>As industries in Pennsylvania continue to develop the technological innovations required for an increasing number of high-paying, digital-first jobs, it is clear the state is well-positioned to continue its long tradition of innovation. Pennsylvania has been a home of innovation since colonial times and through the proliferation of the railroads and mass-produced steel. Outside Benjamin Franklin, Pennsylvania can claim a number of important contributions to American life, including the odometer, Ferris wheel and polio vaccine.</p><p>As a bank with significant roots across the state, and with our own focus on driving innovation, we welcome opportunities to foster the right kind of partnerships and entrepreneurship which are distinguishing the Philadelphia region. A growing number of financial technology companies, or fintechs, have recognized how digital technology and finance could work together to create products to address the evolving needs of customers. However, they lack scale and want no part of the regulation that governs more traditional financial institutions. Many banks have viewed fintechs as disruptors, but smart banks see the value their innovation can bring to customers and are moving decisively to integrate cutting-edge outside technology into their offerings.\u00a0</p><p>Whether by partnering with fintechs or developing their own solutions, most banks are moving quickly to invest in digital capabilities that provide similar kinds of frictionless customer experiences that resonate with customers in an increasingly digital marketplace.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>In the consumer banking space, there are several high-profile examples, such as Zelle for peer-to-peer payments..</p><p>And in commercial banking, there are many new platforms for trading, cash management and payments.</p><p>Speaking from experience, we know that fintech partnerships should be grounded on an appreciation of change, and how to facilitate the right developments.</p><p>From our partnerships, we have found that keeping pace with technological change requires an \"all-hands-on-deck\" approach. Smart thinking and great technologies, whether from inside an organization or from a third-party, represent an opportunity for growth and delivering greater value to customers.\u00a0</p><p>But even in our digital-first world, nothing replaces trust. And while the digital revolution in banking is under way, there are surely many major changes just on the horizon. By staying on top of the competition and constantly evaluating external solutions and opportunities, forward-looking banks can find the right model for modern consumers looking to manage their money better.</p><p>Moving forward, it's apparent that while technology has certainly changed, customer expectations of banking haven't. Fundamentally, customers want a trusted partner. Smart banks have been able to retain what has been best about banking while offering the kind of digital experiences that big tech companies have been providing.</p><p>Today, these banks are adapting to the needs of customers in our digital-first economy by developing solutions that deliver a superb customer experience. The pace of technological change is accelerating, but as customers in Greater Philadelphia increasingly use new channels to access their finances, smart banks are rising to the challenge and providing customers with the best tools to help them reach their potential.</p><p>Daniel K.

Mike Doyle's (D-Penn.) Save the Internet Act to restore strict Title II net neutrality rules Wednesday morning, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the bill is \"dead on arrival,\" and the White House promised to veto the bill should it ever reach President Donald Trump's desk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bill strikes down the Federal Communications Commission's 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which reversed the 2015 Open Internet Order. The 2015 order enabled the FCC to regulate the internet as a telecommunications service under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Five years ago, no one considered the net neutrality debate a major political issue. (According to voter polls ahead of presidential and midterm elections, it still isn't.) But when President Barack Obama politicized the issue in 2014, liberals latched onto the idea of a \"free and open internet\" and believed Title II-based net neutrality rules were -- are -- the only way to preserve it.</p><p>From there, political messaging drove the net neutrality debate, with Democrats on the side of Title II-based net neutrality and Republicans arguing that lighter-touch rules would be more effective. Republicans also argued the rules should come from Congress rather than a federal agency.</p><p>Pro-net neutrality advocacy groups warned that only Title II-based net neutrality rules classifying the internet as a \"telecommunications service\" could truly preserve a \"free and open internet.\" Think tanks opposed to strict net neutrality rules worried they would hurt broadband investment and chill innovation.</p><p>Pro-net neutrality advocates even went so far as to write a fake study showing net neutrality had no impact on broadband investment -- not that they needed to, as broadband investment continues to increase on the whole, and net neutrality rules weren't in effect long enough to provide sufficient data to prove any impact on broadband investment one way or the other.</p><p>Still, those opposed to strict net neutrality rules continue to argue there's a causal relationship between Title II-based net neutrality rules and a \"decline\" in broadband investment.</p><p>When the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed the net neutrality rules created by the Obama administration's FCC (the 2015 Open Internet Order) in December 2017, net neutrality advocacy exploded.</p><p>Tech publications like Gizmodo and the Verge predicted internet service providers (ISPs) and telecom companies would destroy the internet as we know it, and advocacy groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Fight for the Future (FFTF), Free Press and Public Knowledge flooded inboxes and the internet with rallying cries to save the internet, running polls to show that Americans care deeply about net neutrality, and calling out Democrats who weren't supportive enough of the net neutrality crusade.</p><p>Some even peddled the idea that American democracy depends on net neutrality, and that the Trump administration's FCC does everything it can to silence the voice of the people.</p><p>Casting themselves as the saviors of internet users everywhere, Democrats introduced the Save the Internet Act a month ago with a press conference establishing themselves as pro-consumer and anti-big business, even though Democrats know the Republican-controlled Senate won't pass the bill, and even if it does, Trump won't sign it.</p><p>At a press conference Tuesday ahead of the House vote on the bill, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), who proposed non-Title II net neutrality legislation that only focuses on three bright line rules against blocking, throttling and paid prioritization, said the Democrats' Save the Internet Act will \"provide the authority for a government takeover and management of private networks or where and when new broadband networks can, or must, be deployed,\" \"allow government taxation of the internet,\" and \"limit the full potential of 5G and stifle the next wave of innovation in internet services.\"</p><p>Walden and other conservatives fear Title II offers too-broad authority for the FCC to interpret at will when regulating the internet and internet services.</p><p>In an op-ed for Fox News last week, Walden wrote, \"We do not need Title II to achieve real net neutrality,\" further heightening the tension by dismissing Title II advocates and suggesting they don't really care about the issue.</p><p>While the outcomes predicted by both sides are within the realm of plausibility, the debate isn't nearly as black and white or dramatic as Democrats and Republicans paint it.</p><p>Silicon Valley funds the pro-net neutrality advocates because net neutrality benefits Big Tech, and ISPs and telcos fund the anti-net neutrality think tanks because net neutrality doesn't benefit Big Cable or Big Telecom.</p><p>Just by looking at the donors, net neutrality is a battle between two industries vying for a policy decision to protect profits.</p><p>Silicon Valley heavyweights like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix spent more than $40 million lobbying on net neutrality in 2017 ahead of the FCC's December vote to repeal net neutrality rules, while their telecom counterparts lobbied more than $110 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>The center also tracked total lobbying on net neutrality and found that since 2015, pro-net neutrality lobbyists tend to be the Big Tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Netflix especially, while the anti-net neutrality lobbyists tend to be the big cable and telecom providers like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon.</p><p>Net neutrality lobbying dropped off after the December 2017 vote, but Silicon Valley-focused news publications and pro-net neutrality advocates do plenty of work to restore Title II-based net neutrality rules -- with and without Silicon Valley's help.</p><p>A 2014 report from IDG News found that organizations and think tanks on both sides of the debate weren't very transparent about funding, and by 2019, not much changed.</p><p>For example, several organizations don't disclose where their funding comes from at all, like New America's pro-net neutrality think tank, the Open Technology Institute, or the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) which tends to oppose Title II-based net neutrality rules. However, the Center for Public Integrity's Nonprofit Network tool shows that AEI tends to take donations from foundations unaffiliated with Big Cable, Big Telecom or Big Tech.</p><p>Here's the breakdown:</p><p>Of those who oppose Title II-based net neutrality rules,</p><p>* Internet Innovation lists its members (AT&amp;T is one) but doesn't specify how much it gets from each.</p><p>* AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon are all members of Broadband for America (BfA), but BfA also doesn't specify how much members contribute.</p><p>* Between the two of them, United Telecom and National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to anti-net neutrality think tank the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), over the past 10 years, according to data compiled by the Center for Public Integrity's Nonprofit Network tool. ITIF doesn't list funding or donors on its website.</p><p>* The R Street Institute, which advocates for bipartisan legislation on the issue, provides recent Form 990s on its website, but does not list donors.</p><p>* Comcast and the National Association of Broadcasters are two of Rep. Walden's biggest donors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>Of those who advocate for Title II-based net neutrality rules,</p><p>* The EFF lists donors (a mix of foundations and Silicon Valley companies) but also doesn't specify how much they give. According to data compiled by the Center for Public Integrity's Nonprofit Network tool, the scandal-ridden Silicon Valley Community Foundation -- whose major donors include Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen -- gave thousands of dollars to the EFF in the last 10 years, but is not currently listed as a donor on the EFF's website. (The foundation also gave thousands to AEI in 2014.) The EFF also receives an unspecified amount from Credo, a smaller telecom company trying to compete with the Big Four (AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint).</p><p>* Various Silicon Valley companies give to the EFF and up to $10,000 a year to FFTF. Bigger-name tech companies like Yelp and search engine DuckDuckGo give more than that. Credo also gives $50,000 or more a year to FFTF.</p><p>* Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft give at least $200,000 a year each to the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, which advocates for Title II-based net neutrality rules and filed an amicus brief in the lawsuit Mozilla v. FCC, in which Mozilla seeks to restore Title II-based net neutrality rules.</p><p>* Free Press provides an incomplete list of donors on its website, mostly foundations that advocate for social change and progress, but doesn't specify how much they give.</p><p>* Rep. Doyle, despite introducing the Save the Internet Act, receives funding from Granite Telecommunications, the National Association of Broadcasters, and the National Cable Association. \"Telecom services\" as an industry is his top funder.</p><p>While funding pathways don't necessarily or always determine how a think tank or advocacy group chooses a position on a particular issue, it does show what the funders -- in this case, Big Cable, Big Telecom and Big Tech -- think about net neutrality.</p><p>For some of these pro-net neutrality advocacy groups, like FFTF and Free Press, net neutrality is their main issue, and they don't advocate for much else, which begs the question, what do they have to gain from bipartisan agreement and a final end to the net neutrality debate? Financially -- not much.</p><p>While all the pro-net neutrality advocates and tech blogs use urgent language to spur engagement and describe net neutrality as a major issue for internet freedom and democracy itself, FFTF and Free Press use especially divisive language in their fundraising emails and headlines, accusing Republicans of wanting to \"destroy the internet\" with \"fake net neutrality bills\" and \"tricks.\"</p><p>The language is similar to Walden's comment about achieving \"real\" net neutrality, and similar to strong comments from Democrats and Republicans alike on all kinds of political issues in attempts to curry favor with voters.</p><p>Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) pointed out that all members of Congress should be skeptical of political advocates whose organizations focus on a sole issue, simply because that means there's a financial interest to keep a political issue spinning with no resolution.</p><p>\"I think all Members of the Committee should be wary when an organization says compromise and bipartisanship is the enemy -- especially if their financial interests are involved,\" Long said at the House Energy &amp; Commerce subcommittee hearing on the Save the Internet Act a few weeks ago.</p><p>Even though the Save the Internet Act has little chance of becoming law, House Democrats and Republicans can sit back knowing they've succeeded at least in heightening partisanship over the issue and using political messaging to oversimplify the debate.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

But there are bigger fish to fry.<br/>Even if big tech is not discriminating against conservative or other viewpoints in a statistically significant way today (as I discussed\u00a0here), certain regulatory policy pursuits underway could do not only that but also much more, inadvertently or not so inadvertently.</p><p><br/>It is well known that some politicians, dominant social media firms and activists wish to one way or another expunge what they see as objectionable content online. There are all sorts of categories. They have pointed to hate speech, disinformation, misinformation, as well as harmful or\u00a0dehumanizing\u00a0content that they want to root out.\u00a0<br/>Since \u201cmisinformation\u201d or the otherwise objectionable can translate into \"things we disagree with or do not want discussed,\" this inventory can be expected to grow once one side or the other sets the terms.\u00a0<br/>It is important\u00a0not to get complacent\u00a0about this multifaceted campaign and the damage it can do. We may be in a holiday-and-impeachment lull, but this is an issue that will come roaring back with the right trigger.<br/>In the U.S., disagreeable or even hateful speech is constitutionally protected. As one recent statement of principles (cosigned also by my own organization, the Competitive Enterprise Institute) on user-generated content expressed it, \u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t require\u2014or coerce\u2014intermediaries to remove constitutionally protected speech that the government cannot prohibit directly. Such demands\u00a0violate the First Amendment.\u201d\u00a0<br/>In my view, the point of the spear this species of potential social media regulation is actually two-pronged. The first component is a March 2019 declaration from Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The second is a white paper from Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia) titled \u201cPotential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms.\u201d \u00a0<br/>In \u201cThe Internet Needs New Rules,\u201d Zuckerberg asserted that \u201cI believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators,\u201d and endorsed alliances with governments to police harmful online speech. It was not mentioned, of course, but such moves would erect considerable barriers to future social-media alternatives to Facebook.<br/>Zuckerberg said:\u00a0<br/>\u201cLawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree. I\u2019ve come to believe that we shouldn\u2019t make so many important decisions about speech on our own. So we\u2019re creating an independent body so people can appeal our decisions. We\u2019re also working with governments, including French officials, on ensuring the effectiveness of content review systems. ...One idea is for third-party bodies to set standards governing the distribution of harmful content and measure companies against those standards. Regulation could set baselines for what\u2019s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum.\u201d<br/>So far only Facebook has publicly called for this degree of engagement from governments on speech issues, although other tech firms\u2019 calls for massive intervention \u2014 with respect to antitrust,\u00a0privacy, a\u00a0universal basic income\u00a0(the\u00a0plural of apocalypse\u00a0as far as the future of limited government is concerned) and artificial intelligence \u2014 abound. Their coming around to speech guidelines can be anticipated, too, especially given\u00a0some recent statements. (Unwelcome reality-check alert: \u201cDemocracy\u201d is not at stake if regulators refrain from imposing themselves on big tech; quite the opposite.)<br/>While Google, Facebook, Twitter and tomorrow\u2019s offerings are\u00a0private\u00a0media and social media platforms incapable of \u201ccensorship\u201d (only government can do that), in the Zuckerberg hybrid formulation the \u201cdeplatforming\u201d would be preordained, baked into the ecosystem. Most ominously it would constrain emergent networks to the vision of \u201cbaselines for what\u2019s prohibited.\u201d<br/>Would a reasonable person expect, once this path is chosen, that the \u201charmful\u201d content list would shrink over time, or expand? With regard to overreach, how would one measure muted content or speech, since the undesirable couldn\u2019t be kicked off a network they weren\u2019t allowed on in the first place; nor kicked off an otherwise-viable network that never emerged because of preemptive baselines.<br/>It isn\u2019t the chaos and discombobulation that naturally accompany free speech that \u201cthreatens democracy,\u201d as some people smugly assert, but the elitist regulation of that storm. As Federal Communications Commission commissioner Brendan Carr put it,\u00a0\u201cI think a lot of regimes around the world would welcome the call to\u00a0shut down political opposition on the grounds that it\u2019s harmful speech,\u201d<br/>Zuckerberg\u2019s proposals also would inflict painful compliance burdens, too; the paper-pushing involved would alone be more than enough to scupper lesser competitors. He states in \u201cNew Rules,\u201d for example, that:\u00a0<br/>\u201cFacebook already publishes transparency reports on how effectively we\u2019re removing harmful content. I believe every major internet service should do this quarterly, because it\u2019s just as important as financial reporting. Once we understand the prevalence of harmful content, we can see which companies are improving and where we should set the baselines.\u201d\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All this said:</emphasis>\u00a0Facebook-driven efforts to secure global input on content review decisions not only can be but are unequivocably admirable so long as Facebook is describing what it intended to adopt\u00a0for itself on its own platform, using its own infrastructure such as its\u00a0Oversight Board\u00a0(here\u2019s the\u00a0charter\u00a0and\u00a0more\u00a0coverage), its\u00a0Civil Rights Audit\u00a0(here\u2019s\u00a0more\u00a0on it), its Task Force and other resources such as consortia like the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism.\u00a0<br/>But the more ambitious campaign seemingly afoot that would transcend self-policing is more radical, arrogant and condescending to the public. Having benefited from longstanding immunities for user-generated content (rooted in\u00a0Sec. 230\u00a0of the Communications Decency Act) that boosted Facebook\u2019s now-global stature (granted, others enjoyed this immunity, too), this now-dominant firm is urging speech standards and reporting burdens imposed even on companies yet-to-be. Such a development would impart permanence to today\u2019s largest social media firms echoing the semi-permanent exclusive franchises given to the AT&amp;Ts; of the world.\u00a0<br/>It matters not if Zuckerberg refers glowingly to partners as \u201cthoughtful governments that have a robust democratic process.\u201d While free speech in the U.S. is not subject to limitation by majority vote, speech is routinely criminalized throughout the world by these same \u201crobust\u201d democracies; and in the heated modern context, speech is being improperly\u00a0equated to violence. The Brennan Center for Justice\u00a0has noted how political pressure\u00a0from governments has and will surely again reformat displayed information the public sees, and there is no way to know the nature of the internal decision process (and no judicial review if it occurs).<br/>The removal of content at the behest of political leaders, subject to jail or fine, is a scenario playing out worldwide, with\u00a0free expression the conceptual victim\u00a0while real voices against tyranny\u00a0can get silenced. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley\u00a0deemed France\u00a0one of the greatest global threats to free speech; yet rather than rise against this and defend free expression on principle Facebook has\u00a0pledged a partnership\u00a0with French courts against online hate speech (but not against, say,\u00a0socialist\u00a0speech and content, a contradiction to which we must turn later) in which it will\u00a0hand\u00a0over\u00a0information about user/suspects.\u00a0<br/>Social media yielding to more authoritarian governments has and will have grave repercussions for social, cultural and political expression. While U.S. citizens are protected by the First Amendment and one would naively think the Constitution would need to be amended on this score, maybe not. Social media giants and international governments engaging in censorious consultative alliances and frameworks incorporating politically derived norms threaten free expression even in the U.S.. This is reflective of a broader phenomenon of nations\u00a0exporting Internet laws like privacy standards\u00a0globally in order to permit local operations.<br/>Ominously, given the fervor over online speech one would expect U.S. politicians to seek workarounds regarding that nettlesome First Amendment and Constitution \u2014 and they do. This can also even materialize in unexpected ways. For example, the prevailing public-utility mythology, antitrust intervention and the anti-property administrative state apparatus (that some Republicans confoundingly favor expanding to monitor political objectivity) all combine with the wider phenomena of (1) regulation without implementing legislation and (2) deference to agency interpretations and guidance in ways that\u00a0already\u00a0circumvent constitutional protections. It\u2019s not a leap to subsume speech in all this anti-constitutional behavior.<br/>While private entities are incapable of censorship, reconfiguring as semi-governmental oversight bodies with ability to suppress would change that entirely. It would also nullify big tech platforms\u2019 status as\u00a0market\u00a0entities and\u00a0convert them into the essential facilities that they otherwise could never be.\u00a0This puts conservatives in a bind and is part of the furor of the current debate over online regulation.<br/>The pertinent risks, then, may not be the ill-considered reforms of Section 230 immunities that get so much ink; rather, regulation or laws otherwise \u201cset[ting] baselines\u201d could perform an end-run around 230, yet constitute an \u201cindemnification\u201d perhaps more powerful for Facebook\u2019s new incarnation. That is, imposed general baselines would effectively moot Section 230 for alternative social platforms that would have been otherwise indemnified on content henceforth forbidden by \u201cbaselines for what\u2019s prohibited.\u201d<br/>Any semblance of securing compromises and adoption of industry standards certified by governmental bodies that apply to\u00a0everyone\u00a0would unfairly rule out for alternative platforms (existing or emergent) the unfettered free expression that Facebook and other big-tech players heretofore benefited from. In Facebook\u2019s case, this would help it to avoid breakup and fines and further a politically convenient end game of rules that are tough yet tolerable, yet help ensure it not lose its dominant position or become the next MySpace.<br/>Paradoxically, Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cNew Rules\u201d are even compatible with compromising with conservatives such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) and his \u201cEnding Support for Internet Censorship Act\u201d with its proposed requirement for demonstrating political objectivity in order to secure an \u201cimmunity certification\u201d from the FTC to remain protected by Sec. 230. This is because the culmination of \u201cNew Rules\u201d would effectively be an entirely new business model for the biggest of big tech: peace with central oversight of speech in an environment in which Section 230 would be less critical to their success. In one interpretation, as\u00a0Vox\u00a0observed:<br/>\u201c[M]aybe the giant platforms are now so enormous that they don\u2019t need to distribute an infinite amount of content anymore\u2014maybe they could survive by bringing in enormous but manageable amounts of content, which they could actually review before publishing\u2014kind of like a media company. This used to be an unthinkable thought, and still seems to be if you talk to the people who run the platforms. But maybe that\u2019s where we are headed, like it or not.\u201d<br/>Zuckerberg got plenty attention this year, and I don\u2019t mean to unfairly focus on him and his potentially regulatory campaign, because a broader and emphatically pro-regulatory campaign looms. In July 2018, nearly a year before Zuckerberg\u2019s declaration, the\u00a0Columbia Journalism Review\u00a0reported on a leaked draft\u00a0white paper\u00a0from Sen. Mark Warner containing a wide-ranging slate of\u00a0proposals\u00a0to\u00a0regulate content, speech and (most ominously to me) anonymity\u00a0This dramatic and paternalistic intervention is presumably necessitated by the existence of online trolls, misinformation and election interference. Called \u201cPotential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms,\u201d Warner expressed alarm that \u201cbots, trolls, click-farms, fake pages and groups, ads and algorithm-gaming can be used to propagate political disinformation.\u201d\u00a0<br/>Hoo boy. Trial balloon solutions included:<br/>labeling of automated \u201cbot\u201d accounts;<br/>limiting certain elements of anonymity;<br/>placing limitations on Section 230 immunity for re-uploaded content;<br/>liability for defamation, false light and deep fakes;<br/>and defining certain services to be essential facilities.\u00a0<br/>The loss of the civil right of anonymous online speech is an unexplored vulnerability (or intended consequence?) created by the various social media regulatory campaigns. (See\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here\u00a0for some aggravated fretting over the foundational importance in America of the right to anonymous speech.)\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Social media firms bear no obligation to enable anonymity for anyone, of course</emphasis>, any more than they have the duty of objectivity that conservatives mistakenly think they have.<br/>But regulation could make it such that\u00a0other vendors\u00a0could not provide that vital capability of mass-anonymous speech; and in the bargain regulation would protect incumbents from the competitive necessity to do so or be replaced. As is the case with the tech regulatory proposals from Republicans, the federal administrative state apparatus would inevitably expand under Democratic alternatives like Warner\u2019s, with bodies like the FTC and FCC appointed to oversee and punish. Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg was perhaps unsurprised by Warner\u2019s proposals, which had already been \u201ccirculated in tech policy circles\u201d and helpfully\u00a0did not recommend corporate breakup. Sen. Warner later\u00a0reacted favorably\u00a0to Zuckerberg\u2019s new-rules-for-the-Internet manifesto, declaring:\u00a0<br/>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see that Mr. Zuckerberg is finally acknowledging what I\u2019ve been saying for past two years: The era of the social media Wild West is over\u2026.Facebook needs to work with Congress to pass effective legislative guardrails, recognizing that the largest platforms, like Facebook, are going to need to be subject to a higher level of regulation in keeping with their enormous power.\u201d<br/>Guardrails? Warner really did invoke \u201cguardrails\u201d imposed by the likes of himself. Social media possesses guardrails now, and a necessary but forgotten one of them is alertness and conscientiousness and \u201cadulting\u201d on the part of the user (for him or herself, and on behalf of dependents). Competition for authentication and anonymity and other kinds of dynamic content filtering and discipline can and will add still more urgently needed guardrails.<br/>It is legislation and regulation, not their absence, that threaten to remove guardrails\u2014and undermine America\u2019s bedrock principle of free expression in the process.\u00a0<br/>The dangers of social media company, legislative and \u201cwatchdog\u201d-backed mandates to censor speech and otherwise regulate \u201charmful content\u201d\u00a0are themselves the harms facing the Internet of today and the splinternet of tomorrow. Some authoritarian-minded interventionists seek a pre-ordained deplatforming of unpopular ideas and controversial debate and even pretend they protect democracy. The public and policymakers need to remain on high alert, with a finger hovering over that \u201cDelete\u201d button.<br/>Originally published at Forbes.<br/>Image:\u00a0Experts:\u00a0Clyde Wayne CrewsDate:\u00a0Monday, December 2, 2019Source:\u00a0ForbesIssues:\u00a0Antitrust and CompetitionFree SpeechLaw and ConstitutionTech and TelecomSearch Keywords:\u00a0free speechANTITRUSTMedia appearance type:\u00a0Op-Eds and ArticlesTeaser:\u00a0Much of the debate over online speech concerns whether or not conservatives are \u201ccensored\u201d by big tech.

Conservatives are meant to love the old, settled things; capitalism prefers the new and \\x93disruptive\\x94. Conservatives, in theory, support families and communities; capitalism, as Tebbit noted, is individualistic. Conservatives are expected to promote moral virtue; capitalism quite likes us to be weak and impulse-driven, clicking, feeding and indebting ourselves through a lifetime of consumption.</p><p>  In Britain, the curious relationship between conservatism and capitalism is stronger than ever. But in America, that relationship has started to unravel. Republican politicians, intellectuals and media figures are sounding increasingly sceptical about the supposed glories of the free market, and have started to call for more state intervention and tighter regulation of big business. At a recent conservative conference in Washington, DC, according to one attendee, the \\x93slur du jour\\x94 was \\x93neoliberalism\\x94.</p><p>  A turning point came in January, when the Fox News presenter Tucker Carlson told his three million viewers that \\x93Republican leaders\\x94 were in thrall to \\x93corporate propaganda\\x94, and seemed to have forgotten that \\x93market capitalism is not a religion\\x94. Carlson expressed his loathing for private equity and payday loan companies, remarking of the latter: \\x93Libertarians tell us that\\x92s how markets work \\x96 consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it\\x92s also disgusting.\\x94 Subsequently, Carlson has railed against the Koch brothers, the billionaire funders of right-wing think tanks, and has characterised the average Republican politician as \\x93a libertarian zealot controlled by the banks, yammering on about entrepreneurship\\x94.</p><p>  While Carlson fires off sound-bites, a phalanx of intellectuals offers a more in-depth critique. The philosopher Patrick Deneen has persuaded many of his fellow social conservatives that their true enemy is Enlightenment liberalism: a distorted idea of freedom, Deneen argues, which has led to both social progressivism on abortion and marriage, and the injustices and inequalities of modern capitalism.</p><p>  In March this year, several prominent thinkers, among them Deneen and the writers Sohrab Ahmari and Rod Dreher, signed a manifesto celebrating the death of \\x93the old conservative consensus\\x94. Published in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">First Things</emphasis>, traditionally the intellectual journal of the religious right, the manifesto called for \\x93a political movement that heeds the cries of the working class as much as the demands of capital\\x94. The details have been fleshed out by thinkers such as Oren Cass \\x96 who advocates an industrial policy based on supporting workers instead of maximising GDP \\x96 and in the cerebral quarterly <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">American Affairs</emphasis>, the most recent issue of which proposes a huge expansion of child benefit. Part of the money, the authors suggest, could come from a financial transaction tax.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>  To some conservatives, this sort of thinking is outrageous \\x96 \\x93socialism\\x94, according to George Will, the grand old man of the US right. How, Will asks, can people such as Cass call themselves conservatives, when they apparently believe that the state can manage the economy more effectively than the invisible hand?</p><p>  But Will may be out of step with the rising generation of conservatives, many of whom are rejecting past orthodoxies. Josh Hawley, at 39 the youngest member of the Senate, declared in his maiden speech that, thanks to the people \\x93who run our large corporations\\x94, America was suffering from an \\x93epidemic of loneliness and despair\\x94, as well as economic deprivation and the ripping-up of the social fabric. For Hawley, the ultimate example of the new elite is tech companies: he is pushing for regulations, some aimed at making social media less addictive.</p><p>  Then there is Marco Rubio, who after his 2016 presidential campaign was crushed by Donald Trump went away to do some hard thinking. Rubio concluded that \\x93the American work culture \\x96 being able to earn enough to support a family \\x96 is under attack from global economic elites\\x94. The right had put too much trust in the market, Rubio now believes. In May he published a policy paper that startled left-leaning economists by echoing their criticisms of financialisation and shareholder primacy.</p><p>  As Rubio\\x92s experience suggests, Trump\\x92s victory has helped to undermine the old conservative consensus. Trump\\x92s dark rhetoric about the opioid crisis and unemployment, his harping on the theme of \\x93American carnage\\x94, just seemed more in touch with reality than breezy language about the wonders of capitalism.</p><p>  Not that Trump himself has much of substance to contribute to the debate. But he does have a knack for identifying enemies, and his attacks on the Chinese government and Big Tech have prompted new thinking. As John Burtka of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The American Conservative</emphasis> points out, the Republicans haven\\x92t had a decent enemy since the end of the Cold War. But they are warming to Trump\\x92s trade war with China (maybe free trade isn\\x92t all it was cracked up to be?), and his broadsides against Amazon and Google. (Perhaps these giant corporations should be broken up, or at least reined in?)</p><p>  It\\x92s just possible, then, that the American right is about to shake off its past and become a populist coalition against plutocracy, monopoly and exploitation. On the other hand, it can be hard to persuade a conservative movement to abandon free-market dogma. Just ask Theresa May.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dan Hitchens is deputy editor of the Catholic Herald</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4T-V8G1-DYX2-C00N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Statesman Ltd.

Senator <person><nameText>Ron Wyden </nameText></person>asked each of the companies' lawyers, sitting at a long table in front of a gallery of glowering senators, a simple question: \"Are you satisfied with your platform's response to foreign interference in the 2016 election?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google's general counsel Kent Walker bumbled through a response before conceding: \"We could have done more.\" Sean Edgett of Twitter said: \"No, we need to do more.\" Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, said: \"The same is true.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wyden had used the same gambit in 1994 with the bosses of America's top seven tobacco companies. He asked them all: \"Do you believe nicotine is not addictive?\" They all said it wasn't. Four years later, the industry agreed a landmark $246bn settlement, exposing its decades-long lie once and for all and leaving no doubt about the dangers posed by smoking. The question is: are we witnessing big tech's tobacco moment?</p><p>Silicon Valley has been caught flat-footed since Vladimir Putin's regime in Russia began using its platforms to exploit social divisions and sow chaos, not only in America's affairs, but across the West - from elections in France to the Catalan separatist movement and even the EU referendum. These were, after all, companies that pledged to not \"be evil\" (Google) and to \"bring the world closer together\" (Facebook). Instead they have become powerful tools of cyber-espionage, bullying and fake news - something they have been slow to acknowledge, let alone address.</p><p>Over two days and three hearings last week in Washington, the Silicon Valley giants admitted they had not done enough to counter fake news - but they offered few concrete solutions.</p><p>Their underwhelming performance has redoubled calls for the tech titans to be broken up, banned from certain countries or, at best, hit with strict new rules.</p><p>\"I don't think you get it,\" said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the home state of all three companies in the line of fire. \"You have a huge problem on your hands. This could be the beginning of cyber-warfare. You created these platforms and now they are being misused. You have to be the ones to do something about it - or we will.\"</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>150m Number of Americans who may have seen disinformation on its platforms</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>99% Percentage of Facebook's $10.3bn turnover derived from ads</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The most exposed company is Facebook. A year ago, just after the US election, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said it was a \"crazy idea\" that misinformation had played a role in the voting. In an extraordinary reversal, the company admitted last week that up to 150m Americans - 46% of the population - may have seen fake news on its platforms, including Instagram.</p><p>Facebook pledged to hire 10,000 new workers in \"safety and security\" by the end of next year. On the company's quarterly earnings call, Zuckerberg said: \"I am dead serious about this, and the reason I'm talking about this . . . is that I've directed our teams to invest so much in security, on top of our other investments we're making, that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward.\"</p><p>Critics are not ready to take the 33-year-old billionaire at his word. Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business and author of The Four, a critique of the big internet companies, said: \"Facebook is dealing with this crisis with a series of half-measures and denial, and it's going to bite them in the ass. They're literally begging for regulation. They're sticking their chin out and asking somebody to do something severe.\"</p><p>Indeed, while Facebook's general counsel was being hauled over the coals by the Senate committee, Zuckerberg was in China trying to sweet-talk President Xi Jinping into allowing the social network access to the country's potential 1bn-plus users. Jason Calacanis, a Silicon Valley investor, told CNBC this showed \"a complete lack of respect for the democracy that has allowed them [Zuckerberg and other tech chiefs] to receive tens of billions of wealth\". He added: \"Making money is more important to Zuckerberg than protecting democracy.\"</p><p>The day after the hearings, Facebook announced record earnings. In the three months to September, it banked $4.7bn (\u00a33.6bn) in profits, an 80% increase on the same period last year.</p><p>More extraordinary than the financial performance is Facebook's insistence that it is not a media company (Google and Twitter also refuse to be classified as such), which flies in the face of ample evidence to the contrary. This is an important point, because saying it is a media operation would subject it to regulations that so far it has managed to avoid. A fortnight ago, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's operations chief, doubled down on this point. \"At our heart we're a tech company,\" she told the news site Axios. \"We hire engineers. We don't hire reporters.\"</p><p>More than 99% of Facebook's $10.3bn turnover in the last quarter came from ads and it plans to spend $1bn a year on original content. About half of America gets its news from Facebook and more than 6m companies advertise on its platform. The Trump and Clinton campaigns together spent more than $81m on Facebook ads during the election campaign. Galloway said: \"They're afraid of having some sense of obligation around the role that the Fourth Estate plays in society.\"</p><p>A newspaper or broadcaster, for example, has a duty to check facts, correct inaccuracies and vet advertisers. Facebook has dodged all of these obligations. Whether Zuckerberg's proposed self-help will be enough to satisfy is uncertain.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner last month proposed an Honest Ads Act, which would impose the same transparency guidelines for online political ads that apply to newspapers and broadcasters.</p><p>The type of ads that Facebook allowed, which originated in Russia and were sometimes paid for in roubles, points to the paucity of the controls it had in place. The advertisers ranged from a group called the Army of Jesus, which quoted Satan as saying \"If I win, Clinton Wins\", to Secured Borders, which hit on immigration concerns with a picture of a road sign reading \"No Invaders Allowed\".</p><p>Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, admitted in last week's hearing that Facebook knew as early as 2015 Russia was posting misinformation - well before Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the role of fake news in the election.</p><p>Twitter was also littered with misinformation. After first saying it had uncovered 200 accounts connected to the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm linked to the Kremlin, it admitted last week that the real number was about 2,700. It courted Russia Today, which US intelligence has labelled \"the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet\". In the run-up to the 2016 ballot, Twitter reportedly offered up to 15% of all election-related ads on its platform to Russia Today - equal to $3m in ad spend - according to leaked documents. Last week Twitter banned Russia Today.</p><p>Despite the outcry, the meddling has not slowed. The Alliance for Securing Democracy, a Washington-based advocacy group, monitors 58 Kremlin- oriented Twitter accounts. Over the week to October 20, the top hashtags from those websites included \"Maga\" - an acronym for Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan, \"iamhillary\" and \"uraniumone\", relating to the 2010 sale of a uranium miner approved by the Obama administration, which Trump is peddling as a supposed scandal.</p><p>Galloway predicted that unless tech giants moved more aggressively to stamp out such abuse, governments could begin banning them. This would probably happen in Europe, where societies suffer the drawbacks with little of the wealth creation and jobs that America gets.

Expect pay cuts or worse.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For 30-year-old Sasi Kumar, an Uber driver in Delhi, owning a car and earning Rs 15,000-20,000 a month was more than enough. It was more money than he had ever earned; it helped his small family of three survive. He also had the flexibility to earn more if he wanted to; more hours meant extra cash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Life, however, came to a standstill for Kumar this March when the coronavirus pandemic overwhelmed the country. Stuck at home, his earnings abruptly halted, he has been at the mercy of the local moneylender for his expenses, of which the EMI (equated monthly instalment) of the car loan he took from an NBFC (non-banking financial company) accounts for a fat chunk. \u201cUber told me I\u2019d be put on goods delivery duty, but it didn\u2019t work. Getting (police) passes to move around is very difficult,\u201d he says. He has got 20 kilos of wheat-free from the state government, but it isn\u2019t sufficient.</p><p>Kumar earns his livelihood in a growing segment of the Indian economy that employs millions of semi-skilled workers, such as drivers and delivery agents, who work in asset-light businesses that do not offer a social security net. He is also among the millions who have been badly hit by the lockdown the country was put under on March 25 to arrest the spread of COVID-19. Indeed, in the 35 days of the lockdown so far, health statistics reveal that the transmission of the novel coronavirus has been slow. While every death is a tragedy for the family, a country of more than 1.3 billion people has counted a relatively low 1,008 deaths as on April 29, compared to, say, 59,284 in the US. We cannot be sure of the final outcome of the Great Lockdown on the lives of the people. But what we know for sure is the havoc it has wreaked on the livelihoods of those like Kumar. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a private research organisation, estimates that 120 million Indians have been rendered jobless in the one month of the lockdown. Of the total 406 million people employed in the country, only 20 per cent, or 81.2 million, are in the \u00e2(EURO)~salaried\u2019 category. While the pandemic won\u2019t spare them either, the future will be bleaker for the remaining 324.8 million, who are either daily wagers, self-employed or small farmers.</p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in two televised addresses, one shortly after the lockdown, the other almost a month into it, had appealed to businesses not to lay off people and to pay their salaries during the lockdown. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office is also said to be keeping tabs on news items reporting lay-offs and salary cuts. On March 29, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) issued a directive, reiterating what the prime minister had said. The Ludhiana Handtools Association even petitioned the Supreme Court against the order, but, on April 27, the apex court refused petitioners any interim protection against the MHA directive, even though it agreed to hear their plea.</p><p>Anecdotal evidence from across the country continues to point toward companies resorting to lay-offs and wage cuts. A recent survey of 200 CEOs conducted by industry body CII (the Confederation of Indian Industry) showed 52 per cent of them foreseeing job losses in their respective businesses. The tourism and hospitality sector, for instance, is staring at potential job losses of around 38 million, or a whopping 89 per cent of the 42.7 million people directly employed in the sector, a report by advisory firm KPMG said on April 1. The World Travel and Tourism Council, a global forum to raise awareness about the industry, pegs losses in the Indian sector at nine million. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) forecasts that over 15 million jobs could be lost in India\u2019s export sector as half of all orders got cancelled and units are unable to repay loans. CMIE estimates show that unemployment shot up from 6.7 per cent in mid-March to 23 per cent in the first week of April.</p><p>Coming as it did at a time when the Indian economy was already grappling with one of its lowest growth rates in 10 years, the pandemic-induced lockdown will only further bleed the economy. Estimated before the COVID-19 outbreak at roughly 5 per cent, the growth rate for fiscal 2020-21 is now projected to be a dismal 1.5 per cent, according to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessment on April 14. And even that figure is optimistic, considering consultants such as McKinsey have predicted negative growth now that the lockdown will very likely be extended beyond May 3 in 170 \u00e2(EURO)~hotspots\u2019. States that figure in the list of top hotspots are also the biggest contributors to the country\u2019s economy. Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu, for instance, collectively contribute 30 per cent to India\u2019s GDP. This also explains why the government\u2019s call to open businesses in non-hotspots by April 20 evoked a lukewarm response. All major consumer markets remain closed, and no manufacturer wants to create stockpiles that they can\u2019t sell. Disruption in the supply of raw material and labour in addition to the threat of criminal prosecution should staff get afflicted by the disease has forced companies to keep their shutters down. \u201cThere is no light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel,\u201d says Manish Sabharwal, co-founder of TeamLease, an executive hiring firm. \u201cWe do not even know whether we are in the beginning, middle or end of the pandemic.\u201d</p><p>The worst-hit among all sectors are front-end service businesses such as aviation, tourism and hospitality, followed by manufacturers of \u00e2(EURO)~non-essential\u2019 goods and high-street retail. Mahesh Vyas, MD and CEO of CMIE, though, is reluctant to make such distinctions. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to spot the difference between sitting in an environment that is minus 35 degrees and minus 40 degrees. Both are so numbing that the distinction hardly matters,\u201d he says. For instance, in March, one week into the lockdown, the consumption of petroleum products dropped 18 per cent, while the demand for electricity was down 8.8 per cent. \u201cMind you, these are industries exempted from the lockdown,\u201d says Vyas. \u201cIf one screw of an aeroplane doesn\u2019t work, it can\u2019t fly,\u201d he says. As many as 45 per cent of the households CMIE surveyed during the lockdown said they are worse off than they were a year ago. What\u2019s also worrying is the constant decline in India\u2019s labour participation rate, from 47-48 per cent before demonetisation to 45-46 per cent during the note ban in November 2016, down to 42-43 per cent after the Goods and Services Tax was implemented in July 2017, to 35.5 per cent following six weeks of the lockdown.</p><p>As the pain in the economy deepens, the prospect of job and salary cuts only worsens. This is because very few organisations have the ability to survive a sustained lockdown and the resulting economic uncertainty. Only 19,500 companies in India have a paid-up capital of more than Rs 10 crore and, of our 63 million enterprises, only 12 million or roughly 19 per cent, are registered for GST, says Sabharwal. Salaries could well comprise 30-50 per cent of the overall cost of companies, depending on the business they are in. Even if the lockdown is lifted, one does not know how soon the resumed economic activity will be able to generate enough cash flows to maintain operations. Till then, companies will have no option but to let go of some staff, prune salaries or both.</p><p>To assess the impact on the different sectors of the economy, we spoke to a range of entrepreneurs, executives, industry representatives and staff. The picture that emerges is one of deep distress and job uncertainty.</p><p>Automotive: A downhill ride</p><p>The car industry was one of the first to be affected by COVID-19, after imports from China worth $4.7 billion (Rs 35,720 crore) were hit between January and March. By the time supplies from China resumed after the disease was contained in Wuhan, India was under lockdown. Automakers were already battling a 45 per cent year-on-year dip in sales in March, but the complete lockdown poses an even more serious threat to the sector, which employs 44 million people and contributes 9.4 per cent to GDP. Even if the lockdown is lifted on May 3, it will take 3-4 months to get production back on stream, says CII president and Toyota Kirloskar Motor MD Vikram Kirloskar, because \u201cwe need to come out with a 100 per cent vehicle, not a 99.9 per cent one\u201d. Supply chains have been disrupted, and with cash flows drying up, those in the auto aftermarket, component manufacturers, service centres and dealers, are finding it difficult to pay April salaries. Segregating districts according to the level of risk from the pandemic, a Crisil study shows that \u00e2(EURO)~high impact\u2019 and \u00e2(EURO)~very high impact\u2019 districts together account for 56 per cent of two-wheeler sales and 68 per cent of passenger vehicle sales in India. This puts 50 per cent of passenger vehicle sales at risk even if the lockdown is lifted on May 3. Pune-based Bajaj Auto has proposed a 10 per cent salary cut for all employees, with MD Rajiv Bajaj taking a 100 per cent pay cut for the extended lockdown period till May 3. Industry players estimate that one-third of the total 44 million employees, or roughly 14 million, are contract labourers, who can potentially lose their jobs as factories will keep volumes low even after restarting.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying very hard not to lay off people,\u201d says Kirloskar. \u201cWe have invested a lot in honing their skills. It will be tough [to decide].\u201d Even if the industry recovers and sales pick up gradually (a U-shaped rec\u00c2\u00adovery), salaries may still have to be pared and jobs cut, says Deepak Jain, MD of Lumax Industries, a large components player, and president of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA). The auto components sector alone employs some five million people. Dealerships, which number between 15,000 and 17,000, may see over 1,700 of them exit. Overall, the dealership business could lose some 3,400 jobs right away, according to industry estimates.</p><p>Aviation: Grounded by COVID-19</p><p>The airlines sector has been staring at a bottomless chasm ever since international flights initially began to get cancelled before the ban on all air travel till April 14. According to the International Air Transport Association, passenger demand may decline by 36 per cent in India, and passenger revenue may fall by more than $8.8 billion (around Rs 66,880 crore), putting over two million jobs at risk, including sectors dependent on aviation. Airlines are facing a liquidity crisis, as apart from Indigo Airlines, none of the others have adequate cash reserves. On April 30, SpiceJet said it will pay salaries in part to 92 per cent of its staff \u201caccording to the work hours contributed, while maintaining basic thresholds,\u201d adding that it won\u2019t cut jobs \u201cat this time\u201d. IndiGo had at the beginning of the lockdown announced it would cut 25 per cent of staff salaries, but rolled back the decision on April 24. Kapil Kaul, CEO and director, South Asia, of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), says of the nearly 60,000 direct jobs in aviation, 25,000 may get impacted. Even after the sector reopens for business, both business and general travel are likely to remain subdued for months, while social distancing norms would mean airline companies will have to lower their capacities per flight, affecting revenues.</p><p>Real estate: On Shaky Ground</p><p>The property sector had already been in a pre\u00c2\u00adcarious position for almost three years. Demand had lagged, leaving huge inventory. Several developers had defaulted on loans and the worsening of the NBFC crisis dried up funding, which, in turn, increased borrowing cost and strained the finances of real estate firms. With COVID-19, demand has further dried up as potential customers, insecure about their jobs and salaries, have postponed buying. Moreover, physical sur\u00c2\u00adveys by prospective buyers have come to a halt during the lockdown. According to property consultant Anarock, India\u2019s top seven cities had unsold stock of over 644,000 units toward March-end. Of these, as many as 35,200 units, worth Rs 37,550 crore, are in the disease hotspots of Mumbai and Pune. \u201cCities like Mumbai bear the brunt of the pandemic as packed clusters do not allow social distancing,\u201d says Gulam Zia, executive director at Knight Frank India, a property consultant. The lock\u00c2\u00addown has plunged both residential and commercial real estate in Mumbai, a key destination for realty investors, into uncertainty. Besides, the moment Maharashtra lifts the lockdown, hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers in the city, will want to go back to their homes in other states. With no guarantee of when they will return, says Zia, several projects will be in jeopardy. Migrant workers comprise 80 per cent of the construction sector\u2019s 44 million workforce. The real estate sector as a whole employs 52 million, of which 41 million jobs are already affected. \u201cThis is like death for the sector. We\u2019ll have to wait for its reincarnation,\u201d a consultant says.</p><p>Tourism and Hospitality: No Show</p><p>According to a report by ratings agency Care Ratings on the Indian hotel industry, the sector is expected to book a revenue loss of Rs 1.25 lakh crore in 2019-20, assuming a 50 per cent loss in business during January and February this year, and 70 per cent in March due to suspension of international flights. The crisis will also change the rules of how business is conducted in the industry, with stricter enforcement of social distancing norms. It will be a long time before hotels or airlines can run at full capacity. With large-scale travel booking cancellations, the sector will incur a loss of Rs 85,000 crore, says the Indian Association of Tour Operators. Outbound and inbound travel will be at an all-time low even after the lockdown is lifted. Industry experts say the crisis will be greater than 9/11 or the 2008 financial meltdown.</p><p>MSMEs: Small Isn\u2019t beautiful</p><p>The lifeblood of the Indian economy, the MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) sector has a 120 million-strong workforce, contributing 33.4 per cent to India\u2019s manufacturing output and comprising 45 per cent of India\u2019s exports. At the same time, the sector is also among the most vulnerable, relying heavily on day-to-day business to stay afloat and more exposed to the vagaries of demand than their larger counterparts. They also have minimal reserves to dip into during periods of crises. According to estimates by the All-India Manufacturers Organisation (AIMO), between 22 million and 51 million jobs will be hit if the lockdown extends beyond 4-8 weeks, with disruptions in demand as well as in the supply chains, lack of economic activity and mounting bills. The key export markets of the US and UK are shut. Textile companies are sitting with ready orders. Being a fashion-sensitive market, most of the current stock could be deadstock by the time the summer season comes to a close. With most MSMEs, including textile companies, having just enough funds to tide over for a month perhaps, layoffs of the low-wage workers have already begun.</p><p>Information technology: A New Y2K moment</p><p>\u201cNobody knows what\u2019s out there,\u201d says Sangeeta Gupta, senior VP and chief strategy officer of Nasscom, or the National Association of Software and Service Companies. India\u2019s IT sector provides direct employment to 4 million people and indirect employment to 10 million. It is also the industry that put India on the global map and it continues to attract talent from India and abroad. Much of the sector adapted rather quickly to the lockdown with a Work from Home (WFH) protocol, meeting domestic and international client commitments. Nimble digital organisations adapted faster, says Gupta; most of the big IT firms have nearly 92-93 per cent of their workforce working from home, some even 100 per cent. TCS has announced that even when things return to normal, 75 per cent of their 450,000 workforce will permanently work from home or from anywhere. The shift will take place over the next two years. The story could well be different for smaller firms, but, fortunately, nearly 90 per cent of the IT workforce is employed with big tech. Every company is focusing on rationalising costs and new fields they can explore. The good news is that the big IT firms are not looking at laying off workers. However, there will be no increments either this year. C.P. Gurnani, CEO of Tech Mahindra, says the new format of working has put him in direct touch with a larger employee base. Senior management at the company is forgoing their variable pay for the year. \u201cWe have decided that whatever steps we take, will start from the top. People who draw less than Rs 3.5 lakh-4 lakh per annum will not get any cuts. It all depends on how the market shapes up and until we conquer the enemy (COVID-19).\u201d</p><p>Gems and Jewellery: Losing its Sheen</p><p>Employing over 4.6 million workers, the gems and jewellery sector is likely to witness 10-20 per cent job losses, say industry sources. Although manufacturing units have started opening in Jaipur and elsewhere too with certain restrictions, the general view is that employers will be paying 70 per cent of total wages for April. The two major jewellery shows scheduled for August and September in Mumbai are likely to be cancelled.</p><p>Retail: No One\u2019s Buying</p><p>Industry estimates say of the 40-60 million jobs in Indian retail, 11 million are likely to take a hit. While production and supply of essential goods have continued despite hiccups, restarting production for non-essentials will be a daunting task as supply chains remain disrupted and bringing migrant labour back to the shop floor will be a challenge. Malls and shopping complexes will continue to be avoided. Demand was already slackening; there will now be even fewer takers for higher-priced goods.</p><p>Many see the present crisis as worse than the one precipitated by the 2008 financial meltdown. Nor is anyone able to accurately predict how long the pain will last, as a lot depends on how the disease spreads and how the country\u2019s health infrastructure copes with it. Meanwhile, industry is looking to the government to announce policy measures to save businesses and jobs. The US House of Representatives passed a $484 billion spending package on April 23 even as 26 million people filed jobless claims there since the spread of the pandemic. By comparison, the Rs 1.7 lakh crore package finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced on March 27 is inadequate, say experts. They warn that in the effort to fight the pandemic, the collapse of livelihoods may well prove more gruesome than the disease itself if effective economic remedies are not offered. They have called for an additio\u00c2\u00adnal rescue package of Rs 10 lakh crore, about 5 per cent of India\u2019s Rs 200 lakh crore economy, to redeem businesses.</p><p>The aviation sector is seeking a moratorium on loans, waiving airport and fuel infrastructure charges, and bringing aviation turbine fuel under GST. The auto industry wants the government to spur demand by reducing taxes and making loans cheaper. The government is also being expected to back firms taking bank loans with guarantees, and smaller players and dealerships are looking for a moratorium on bank loans. The real estate sector wants the government to stimulate demand through incentives, relaxing Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA) compliance for projects for a maximum of six months, and fixing lending rates for realty projects at a lower repo rate. Travel and tourism services are demanding a GST holiday, a waiver for the next year on all power tariffs and property and excise taxes and working capital at lower interest rates. The textile sector, meanwhile, is seeking an extension of the tax compliance deadline, more credit support, waiver of electricity charges and other such rentals. The retail sector is seeking an extension of the 270-day moratorium on instalment and interest payments on term loans, GST waivers and faster clearances on production of non-essentials. It is also hoping for higher credit from banks and NBFCs. MSMEs are seeking government support to compensate for wages, power tariff waivers and relief from declaration as a non-performing asset.</p><p>The Future Workplace</p><p>COVID-19 has fast-forwarded changes in the workplace that will impact how business is done and businesses are run. Flexible work schedules, partitioned workspaces, lesser travel and conferencing, staggered workplace attendance and small huddle spaces will be the new norms. In large manufacturing units, new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning as well as robotics are likely to gain ground. As migrant workers leave cities, wages for semi-skilled workers could even go up. The displaced workforce in cities could find itself absorbed in logistics, sales or customer services. India could see a surge in the gig economy, with more workers being hired on contract and less job security as companies look for ways to curtail fixed costs.</p><p>On the bright side, however, T.V. Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education, predicts a surge in productivity. Organisations will be deconstructed to become more efficient, agile and fluid. \u201cIf a sales meeting can be done on the phone and the sales agent can accomplish 10 meetings like that as against three in-person meetings, the results are positive,\u201d he says. As India explores new ideas and ways of doing business, start-ups with disruptive ideas could become the big gainers. Capital to scale will not come easy but India will emerge as one of the favoured destinations for investments. Experts say sectors such as specialised e-commerce, e-health, education and entertainment will get a push.</p><p>However, India too, like the rest of the world, is currently grappling with uncertainty. Never mind innovation, most companies are struggling to maintain continuity. India\u2019s crisis is amplified (or exacerbated) by all the red tape and the unease of doing business in a regulatory framework that requires businesses to jump through a myriad clearance hoops. At the same time, India is uniquely placed to take advantage of the new business wariness about China. It should, as Teamlease\u2019s Manish Sabharwal put it, go for \u201cflick-of-the-pen reforms and long-term structural reforms\u201d. In waging its dour battle against the corona pandemic, India should not lose sight of the opportunity this great adversity brings.</p><p>Agony in the informal sector</p><p>Migrant workers, hundreds of thousands of whom made their way back to native villages and towns across India in March as the COVID-19 outbreak shut down factories and other avenues of their employment, are a grim reminder of the unique challenge the government faces as it looks to bring the battered Indian economy back on track. According to the Economic Survey of 2018-19, released in July 2019, almost 93 per cent of the workforce is \u00e2(EURO)~informal\u2019.</p><p>Sonu Yadav, 25, from Hisua in Bihar\u2019s Nawada district, worked at a factory making corrugated boxes in Chhattarpur, Delhi. He earned about Rs 11,000 a month. When the factory shut down on March 20, Yadav and 100-odd workers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were told to leave. \u201cWe waited for a week, hoping work would resume,\u201d says Yadav. But with his savings depleting and the factory refusing to pay salaries during the lockdown, Yadav decided to walk home. He reached the UP border, where police put him on a truck that took him to his hometown.</p><p>The International Labour Organization estimates that the COVID-19 crisis could force around 400 million informal workers in India deeper into poverty. To soften the blow of the lockdown, the government announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package for the poor on March 27. Among the sops were free rations for three months, cooking gas and direct cash transfers.</p><p>That it could be months before migrant workers make their way back to cities for employment brings up a serious manpower crisis for factories looking to restart operations once the lockdown is lifted. When Rahul Ahuja, chairman of the Punjab unit of CII, got permission to restart his four auto spare parts factories, the administration allowed 350 out of his 1,000 employees to work, but only 200 were available. Around 3 million migrant workers are employed in Punjab. State industry representatives say factories will not be able to afford more than half of these workers during their post-lockdown recovery phase.</p><p>Economist Arun Kumar considers the situation \u201cworse than war\u201d. \u201cDuring war, factories run at full capacity and it is a full-employment economy. Today, both supply and demand have collapsed,\u201d he says, predicting that the industry needs at least 2-3 months to even get a whiff of a revival in demand.</p><p>with Anilesh S.

It planted the seed for Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company by 2000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract awarded by the Pentagon sends a message to companies and governments around the world about the profound change in how all technology runs.</p><p>The organisation at the core of the world's largest military industrial complex knows the cloud will put the most sophisticated war waging capabilities within reach of every soldier.</p><p>Winning the contract tells the sceptics in the cloud computing world that Microsoft's cloud capabilities, which include 54 data centres around the world, are as good as those of Amazon Web Services, which is three times its size.</p><p>Finally, the JEDI contract should remove once and for all the nervousness that still pervades many companies and government departments and agencies about security in the cloud. Microsoft has 3500 cyber-security engineers and invests $US1 billion a year in cyber security.</p><p>In the three weeks since the Pentagon made its controversial decision, the Jeff Bezos-owned <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/amazon-protests-against-loss-of-pentagon-s-10-billion-jedi-contract-20191115-p53b3x\">Amazon Web Services has had a dummy spit</url> and Microsoft's sharemarket value has risen by about $US50 billion to $US1.14 trillion.</p><p>Both Amazon, which says it will sue the government to have the JEDI deal overturned, and financial markets have clearly recognised the importance of the deal and its longer-term ramifications.</p><p>In many ways the JEDI contract, which runs for 10 years, is the ultimate rolled gold stamp of approval for Nadella's decision to shift Microsoft's strategic direction towards hyper-scale cloud computing, under the banner of Azure.</p><p>Not that he needed confirmation of his brilliance. Since he took over as chief executive in February 2014, Microsoft's stock price has risen fourfold, adding about $US850 billion in value.</p><p>At first, Nadella's move into the cloud was a worry to a Microsoft board of directors used to thinking about the world as Bill Gates did, with a PC on every desk running proprietary software that was updated every three years. The company was used to earning profit margins of 90 per cent.</p><p>But as revenues grew his vision was recognised. The growth in the volume of new business has compensated for the fall in margins to about 63 per cent.</p><p>Nadella prioritised the Azure cloud business before he became CEO. When he took over from Steve Ballmer in February 2014, he set out to change the Microsoft culture. This multi-year task is well described in his 2017 book, Hit Refresh.</p><p>Embracing open-source code</p><p>Microsoft has positioned itself as a friend of software developers. Nadella pulled down the company's walled-garden approach to software development and embraced open-sourced coding.</p><p>The company is the world's strongest supporter of the Linux open source coding system and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/microsoft-sees-github-as-faster-path-into-cloud-ai-20180605-h10yo6\">its purchase of GitHub</url> for $US7.6 billion in 2018 gave it access to 36 million open source software developers.</p><p>Nadella recognised early on that everything would become digital and all software applications could live either in the cloud or on servers controlled by customers on their premises.</p><p>About three years ago Microsoft's software engineers broke everything in the company's suite of products into modular applications. Instead of offering customers monolithic systems that take years to embed and always cost more than expected, Nadella rebuilt everything on Azure so customers can pick and choose and mix and match.</p><p>He had the insight to recognise Microsoft's foundations as a provider of productivity tools for large enterprises through the Office product set could be the springboard for turning the company into the platform for digitisation of just about any task in any industry.</p><p>It is this digitisation of everything that makes Hamish Douglass, chairman and chief investment officer at Magellan Financial Group, believe that Microsoft is only at the very beginning of its cloud-driven expansion.</p><p>\"I think of the cloud as a platform,\" he says. \"When we move to the Internet of Things, businesses and government departments, are going to start digitising processes and moving those processes to the cloud and then start processing the data with machine learning and AI [artificial intelligence].\"</p><p>\"I think they're building an entire platform for digitising the enterprise,\" he says. \"They are developing their own productivity software through Dynamics and Office, but also I think they want to be hosting other people's software.</p><p>\"Who knows what software's going to be written in the next 10 to 20 years? There's going to be the digitisation of health services, the taxation department, manufacturing processes and all the smart things through the Internet of Things.</p><p>\"I think because they're an enterprise company and they have all these components, they're so well positioned. The commercial cloud business is already growing at 30 per cent a year and they haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of this.</p><p>\"This business has come from nowhere 10 years ago to $US40 billion a year. We're talking about a market that's going to be in the trillions of dollars of addressable market.\"</p><p>Magellan owns $3.1 billion in Microsoft shares as part of its global equities strategy. Douglass says he first bought the shares in 2013 when the stock was $US28 a share and the market thought \"Windows was dead\".</p><p>Nadella says every company is now a technology company and the next big technology breakthroughs will come \"not only from technology companies, but from retailers, healthcare providers and manufacturers, working in partnership with us\".</p><p>\"It's fantastic to see this in action in Australia, where we're partnering with leaders in every industry and across the public sector to apply technology to address some of their biggest challenges - from improving healthcare outcomes and optimising employee training to empowering first line workers,\" he says.</p><p>Amazon had a four year head start on Microsoft in cloud computing but Nadella came to the market with a bold growth target of creating a $US20 billion-a-year business by 2018.</p><p>This stretch target was sold to Wall Street by chief financial officer Amy Hood, who has all the hallmarks of being the next CEO of Microsoft whenever Nadella chooses to depart.</p><p>She has brought stringent discipline to Microsoft's business fundamentals and a laser-like focus on the entire expenses line. Most divisions have flat budgets and must get expansion capital from transformation benefits.</p><p>Amazon still dominates cloud computing with a market share of 48 per cent, according to Gartner. But Microsoft is rapidly catching up.</p><p>In the year to June the Azure cloud business grew by 63 per cent and its market share rose to 15.5 per cent, while Amazon's share went backwards. Microsoft has more than doubled its market share since 2015.</p><p>The narrowing gap in market share partly explains why Amazon is so angry about losing the JEDI contract. It has accused the US government of \"unmistakable bias\" and is readying a court challenge. It will be fascinating to see whether Bezos, the publisher of The Washington Post, can prove President Donald Trump was involved in the decision.</p><p>Is it no surprise cloud momentum is with the company with the JEDI contract, considering Microsoft's co-founder Paul Allen built a pop culture museum in Microsoft's home town, Seattle. It is full of Star Wars memorabilia, including Luke Skywalker's lightsaber.</p><p>The JEDI contract is significant from multiple perspectives, according to Microsoft president Brad Smith. During an interview with The Australian Financial Review in his office at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington, he hints it will have ramifications for US military allies such as Australia.</p><p>\"I think if this contract were awarded in 2016, or maybe even 2017, it more likely would have gone in another direction because Azure was not as full-featured as it is today,\" he says. \"And so it just reflects the incredible investment we made in innovation, especially with an eye towards meeting the needs of large customers like the Department of Defence.</p><p>\"I think it is a reflection, second, of the degree to which the world is embracing the cloud. In part, the clear philosophy of the Pentagon is they need to move faster to get to the cloud, because that's where the future is, and they can't expect to be the leading military force in the world if they're not using the cloud.</p><p>\"I think that is a lesson that speaks not only to the military forces of the world, but fundamentally to every type of institution in the world.</p><p>\"And so, yes, I think that we may well see this speak to people in other industries, or areas of government, as well.</p><p>\"Third, you know, every contract is important, but some contracts are more important than others, and you know this award is not just a contract, it's a responsibility, you know, and it creates for Microsoft a very important responsibility for the defence of the United States, and fundamentally the protection of the American people,\" Smith says.</p><p>\"And, yes, I think the single most important thing that we do, as a company, is act with the acute appreciation of the responsibility that creates for us.</p><p>\"As we do that, you know, I think that it is an opportunity, almost by definition, to connect with the other governments and military forces that are close allies to the United States. I think that, again, that takes us to the other four of the Five Eyes, and to the 26 other NATO members, in particular.</p><p>\"And so I think this is a contract that's going to have multiple ramifications over many years, for the role that we need to play in many parts of the world.\"</p><p>There are many aspects to the brilliance of Nadella's strategic shift to the cloud, not the least of which was his decision to use Microsoft as a test bed for a corporate transformation.</p><p>After all, how can you possibly convince your customers of the merits of tech transformation tools if you have not used them yourself?</p><p>Microsoft's chief digital officer and executive vice-president corporate strategy and operations, Kurt DelBene, says Nadella recognised early on that the old way of running IT was broken and would not enable companies to transform themselves at the pace required in a digital age.</p><p>\"Two and a half years ago, Satya was really saying, 'We're seeing all this transformation that happens in our customer base or that they want to know what transformation needs.' They have an inkling that the way they do IT today is not going to survive,\" DelBene says.</p><p>\"It's just the wrong way to think about it. Essentially, speccing out a system that you need, based on your people inside the organisation, saying, 'I need you to deliver these features.'</p><p>\"And you then go to somebody like Accenture, and say, 'Deliver me these features', and then they run it, and with no real insight as to what the business processes are and how those are going to change over a period of time, or need to change over a period of time to get where you need to go.</p><p>\"And so, I think what's put a head on that is this recognition by all industries that digitisation - or this tech intensity, as Satya talked about it - this need to have technology, software, services be a core part of your business, moving forward, is exploding.\"</p><p>Nadella gave DelBene the task of transforming Microsoft's approach to managing IT. He knew the job was in good hands because DelBene had just spent seven months fixing healthcare.gov for president Barack Obama.</p><p>\"We were two-thirds outsourced, so we did the thing that everybody did of listening to constituents and then just parrot it back and say, 'Build us this',\" DelBene says.</p><p>\"We did not have a deep technical bench, in terms of people being able to really envision what the software can do, and then actually code it. We basically ran the systems that we specced and had delivered.\"</p><p>DelBene says Microsoft's transformation resulted in huge costs savings from in-sourcing software development.</p><p>\"We're about two-thirds in-sourced now,\" he says. \"We've massively reduced our outsourcing dependency, as a result, in hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>\"We have moved 95 per cent of our systems to the cloud. We have a vision for every single one of our product areas in concert with the stakeholders.\"</p><p>During its transformation, Microsoft moved to what DelBene calls a \"DevOps\" model, which means the developers who wrote the code also operate the system they wrote the code for.</p><p>Under Nadella's leadership, Microsoft has married the perpetual software licensing approach in Microsoft's Office 365 products with the perpetual licensing that comes with cloud infrastructure.</p><p>DelBene says Nadella's \"superpower\" is in \"envisioning where the industry's going, envisioning products, stitching together different patterns into new products\".</p><p>Nadella sees patterns in the way customers are using products and responds by directing software development resources to these areas.</p><p>Microsoft's business is broken down into three segments: productivity and business processes, which includes Office 365, LinkedIn and Dynamics 365; intelligent cloud, which includes server products and cloud services; and more personal computing, which includes Windows, Bing, Xbox and Surface computer devices.</p><p>One-stop shop</p><p>No other company offers under one roof computing as a service, storage, productivity apps, front-office apps, core financials, data analytics, identity security, artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p><p>As Microsoft grows more powerful and its services and products become more pervasive across business and government, it is bound to catch the attention of regulators.</p><p>This is already happening, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/956ccaa6-0537-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca\">warning of potential \"sovereignty\" issues</url> from the storage of data on Microsoft servers even though they are located in Germany.</p><p>The Financial Times reported last week that Merkel told a union conference: \"So many companies have just outsourced all their data to US companies. I'm not saying that's bad in and of itself ??? I just mean that the value-added products that come out of that, with the help of artificial intelligence, will create dependencies that I'm not sure are a good thing.\"</p><p>There is no doubt that whatever concerns Merkel has will be addressed in fulsome detail by Smith, who is sometimes referred to as the US secretary of state for tech.</p><p>It his consummate management of regulatory issues that is largely responsible for Microsoft avoiding the intense political scrutiny and public opprobrium directed at Facebook, Google and Twitter.</p><p>Rod Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, says Microsoft was not like the new digital platform companies such as Facebook and Google, which he says have never taken responsibility for what happens on their platforms.</p><p>\"Facebook and Google say, 'we are just a platform, just like Airbnb', whereas the larger tech companies like Microsoft have never had that approach,\" he says. \"They are a company doing business in a way companies do. They take a broader approach. They can see they have got to get ahead of these things.</p><p>\"I think Microsoft is a company that understands responsibility because they have been a broad business enterprise.\"</p><p>Smith, who is also Microsoft's chief legal officer, has taken a proactive stance across all the big tech debates including privacy, the digital divide and artificial intelligence.</p><p>A company once labelled \"the Evil Empire\" and at the forefront of attempts by anti-trust regulators in the US to be broken apart 20 years ago is largely missing from US congressional committee meetings.</p><p>Smith made sure Microsoft leads from the front on just about every contentious regulatory issue. For example, Microsoft voluntarily adopted Europe's General Data Protection Regulation privacy rules across all its products worldwide.</p><p>It was Smith who made sure Microsoft sent a senior executive from head office to Australia when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called a meeting of technology executives earlier this year in the wake of the Christchurch mosque shootings.</p><p>Facebook and Google sent local representatives who could not speak on behalf of head office and were therefore berated by Morrison.</p><p>Smith wrote a book with Carol Ann Browne called Tools and Weapons. It is the blueprint for showing technology companies how to take responsibility for the technology they create and assist governments left behind by the pace of innovation.</p><p>It will come in handy if Elizabeth Warren is elected president in next year's US election. She says technology companies have too much power, engage in anti-competitive behaviour and must be broken up.</p><p>Microsoft does exercise its market power. From October 1, newly purchased Microsoft SQL Server and Windows Server licensees cannot be migrated to dedicated or single servers in the cloud offerings of Amazon and Google without paying additional fees. The licence fees are substantially less if the customer migrates to Azure.</p><p>Transformative role in Australia</p><p>In Australia, Nadella will meet selected clients in business and government, as well as be the special guest at a Chanticleer lunch in Sydney on Wednesday.</p><p>\"For nearly four decades, we've partnered closely with leading organisations of every size in every industry in Australia to help them innovate,\" he says ahead of his arrival.</p><p>\"Today, more than two million Australian organisations use our platforms and tools, and we are investing significantly in our local engineering presence, as well as our data-centre footprint in the country, so customers can build the digital capability increasingly required to compete and grow.\"</p><p>One of Microsoft's largest customers and partners is Telstra. It is an Azure customer, the biggest reseller of Microsoft 365, and it will be the exclusive Australian partner for the launch of the new Xbox All Access gaming package, a gaming subscription service.</p><p>Telstra chief executive Andy Penn says Telstra is using a Microsoft product called Teams to collaborate and work in an agile way as part of its transformation.</p><p>\"Much of what we're trying to achieve from a transformation point of view and moving to agile is what we see our customers wanting to do as well,\" he says.</p><p>Penn says Telstra needs to be much more closely aligned with companies like Microsoft and their way of working and thinking.</p><p>\"We need bring together the capabilities of telecommunications and software and that's why we have worked really closely with partnerships and relationships with people like Microsoft,\" he says.</p><p>Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer says Microsoft has helped boost collaboration at the bank.</p><p>\"One of the things I find really interesting at the moment is if you combine what the tools can do for normal working people in office environments with new structures of how you manage people, it's really quite profoundly changing what goes on in a big company and the way a big company goes about doing its work,\" he says.</p><p>In the tech bubble heyday of Microsoft, the company was often accused of being arrogant. That is unlikely to happen this time judging from Smith's comments about the possible lessons from winning the JEDI contract.</p><p>\"Never assume that you're in the leadership position in technology because the leadership position can change quickly,\" he says. \"Never conclude that you're so far behind that you can't catch up.\"</p><p>Disclosure: The author's self-managed super fund owns shares in Microsoft.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520206113</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHP-KXJ1-DY19-C30S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3312\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

For the uninitiated, it's a crapshoot. The more time spent staring at the images, the more convincing the fakes appear. Doubt seeps in. The more unnerving the game becomes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Levandowski, more skilled in separating what's real from Silicon Valley creations, spotting the telltale signs of images designed to deceive is an easier task. A small discoloration. A stray hair. He has aced six in a row, and his enthusiasm spills over as he gains momentum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Look, look at the freckle on the side,\" he exclaims, pointing to an otherwise innocuous blemish.</p><p>While he examines images with dermatological care, he's oblivious to the gawkers and passersby captivated by the presence of the self-driving pioneer whose stints at Google and Uber remain daily news fodder. With his 6-foot-7 frame, thinning hairline and boyish smile, there's no doubt the real deal sits a few feet from the counter where they await their lattes.</p><p>What they make of Levandowski remains a murkier question. In a region known for turning its technology wunderkinds into outsized caricatures of themselves, nobody cuts a longer shadow than the one prosecutors say stole trade secrets from one Big Tech behemoth and brought them to another.</p><p>He's a visionary. As a college student, Levandowski entered a self-driving motorcycle nicknamed GhostRider into a Department of Defense competition designed to stimulate interest in autonomous vehicles. A technical mistake at the start spoiled the undertaking, but the chutzpah necessary to enter a motorcycle in the first place impressed friends and future employers.</p><p>He's an opportunist. In 2011, when he led hardware development for Google's self-driving car project, he engineered the sale of two companies, 510 Systems and Anthony's Robots, to Google. Many members of the project were unaware Levandowski owned them.</p><p>He's the personification of Silicon Valley's more unseemly impulses. He's flouted regulations in multiple states, allegedly endangered a colleague and a member of the public during self-driving testing, rankled others with an abrasive management style and hopscotched from his job at Google to Uber with at least one confidential document in hand.</p><p>Levandowski, now 40, has heard it all.</p><p>\"There's a whole narrative about me,\" he tells Automotive News. \"I got branded as an asshole if I said, 'Here, how do we build something that succeeds?' Everything comes down to this: Ideas should be challenged. Conversations about our ideas are healthy. And ultimately, we're here to make a product.\"</p><p>Over the past two years, those conversations often occurred inside a courtroom. Waymo, Google's self-driving car unit, accused Uber of absconding with proprietary knowledge of the company's essential lidar technology, via Levandowski, and of using those documents to accelerate Uber's self-driving progress. The dispute was settled in February 2018, with Waymo receiving a stake in Uber worth approximately $245 million at the time.</p><p>For Levandowski, legal reverberations continued. The judge presiding over the civil suit recommended him for criminal prosecution. Last summer, Levandowski was indicted on 33 felony counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets. One national magazine called the case \"the most prominent federal trade-secret criminal prosecution in Silicon Valley history,\" one that pitted a brilliant engineer against a multibillion-dollar company and a government emboldened to use new legal tools to deter corporate espionage.</p><p>A case some observers characterized as Big Tech's turn against innovation itself, the United States of America v. Anthony Scott Levandowski reached its crescendo this month. For all the potential implications and precedents, the outcome underscored one point: In Silicon Valley, things may not always be as they appear.</p><p>Early tensions</p><p>Following the foundational events sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, known as DARPA, that brought Levandowski and other roboticists together in the Nevada and California deserts during the mid-aughts, Google in 2009 launched Project Chauffeur. That was the first iteration of its foray into self-driving developments.</p><p>Ambitions were grandiose. Through the mass deployment of self-driving vehicles, Google promised nothing less than a wholesale transportation revolution, one with potential to eradicate more than a million worldwide traffic deaths every year and end the monotony of driving for everyday commuters.</p><p>DARPA alums Sebastian Thrun and Chris Urmson served as early leaders of the project, and Levandowski, who had worked on Google's Street View project since the DARPA challenges, soon joined them as director of the team's hardware division.</p><p>During his stint at Street View, Levandowski started a side company, 510 Systems, that engineered tools that helped turn camera-based images into data. By 2011, the same underlying technology was needed to boost Google's self-driving car program. Whether through entrepreneurial cunning or genuine interest in helping, Levandowski engineered the sale of 510 Systems to Google for $20 million.</p><p>He sold another company, Anthony's Robotics, to Google as well. At least initially, most Google employees didn't understand the connections. Levandowski says he was forthright about his motives.</p><p>\"I didn't do that to cash out,\" he says. \"I did it to scale up.\"</p><p>The acquisitions nonetheless left uneasy feelings on both sides. Once Google acquired 510 Systems, several employees of the startup were dismissed while others slotted into subordinate roles at Google. Levandowski says he regrets not advocating for the 510 Systems staff in a more aggressive manner. But for the time being, Levandowski retained the backing of Google's senior leadership, and he and his colleagues coexisted.</p><p>That changed in the summer of 2013 following a seminal moment for the self-driving car project. Google entrusted some employees on public roads with its fledgling technology. One driver trusted it so completely, he fell asleep behind the wheel. Alarmed, Google scrapped its entire development approach.</p><p>Humans, the company concluded, must have no role in the driving process. From Levandowski's perspective, the company learned the wrong lesson.</p><p>\"To me, it was perfect because it showed that we had achieved trust,\" he says. \"You don't go from a great product to a hard pivot. You say, 'Let's fix that. Let's detect that.' But they're going to take this science project that we're doing to cure one disease, and saying, 'No, no, let's pull that until we cure all diseases.' \"</p><p>Tensions mounted. Soon after, he says, another project met a discouraging end. Spawned from a need to find reliable transportation around its hometown, Mountain View, Calif., Google started its own ride-hailing network on a small scale, Levandowski says. It was called Freebird, and it resembled in spirit a San Francisco startup just beginning to upend transportation.</p><p>Had the project been allowed to flourish, Levandowski laments, perhaps Freebird would today be as ubiquitous as Uber. Instead, he says, Google leaders viewed the network as a distraction and shelved the project.</p><p>For the first time, Levandowski had doubts about his future at the company. He had disagreed with the self-driving-or-bust pivot, been passed over in favor of Urmson when Thrun departed and now seethed as a novel project was shuttered. Frustrations boiled. The feelings were mutual.</p><p>\"With his manipulations and lack of enthusiasm and commitment to the [self-driving] project, it became clearer and clearer that this was a lost cause,\" Urmson told lawyers during an August 2017 deposition at the outset of Waymo's civil suit against Uber.</p><p>Discussions with Uber</p><p>The final straw came in the summer of 2015, when Levandowski approached colleagues about joining him at a new startup dedicated to developing self-driving trucks. Word leaked. Urmson was livid. In an email to his bosses sent Aug. 4, 2015, he was blunt: \"We need to fire Anthony Levandowski.\"</p><p>That didn't happen. But his departure came soon enough. By that December, Levandowski held discussions with then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who would later tell Bloomberg that self-driving technology was \"basically existential\" for the ride-hailing network's long-term survival.</p><p>On Dec. 11, 2015, Levandowski downloaded approximately 14,000 documents from a password-protected Google server, according to court documents. A month later, he announced his departure and the creation of autonomous trucking startup Ottomotto, known as Otto. Discussions with Kalanick continued, and in August 2016, Uber acquired Otto for $680 million.</p><p>Google was furious.</p><p>Jousting with regulators</p><p>Meanwhile, Levandowski had charged into his first chance to run his own self-driving program, with little regard for obstacles. In May 2016, Nevada's top transportation official warned Otto officials they did not have permission to conduct a driverless test on the state's roads. Levandowski greenlighted a test run anyway.</p><p>Over the summer, company documents indicate, Otto tested a \"self-driving system\" in \"self-driving mode\" on California public roads. That was problematic because state regulations prohibit the testing of autonomous vehicles with a gross weight of 10,001 pounds or more. In December 2016, California Department of Motor Vehicles officials revoked the registrations of Uber test vehicles after Levandowski argued the state's permitting process didn't apply to its vehicles.</p><p>\"He has a willingness to take risks to advance his cause in near total indifference to what others may think of him and his endeavors,\" said Randy Miller, a friend of Levandowski since their days at the University of California, Berkeley and member of the GhostRider team. \"He's a really, really smart guy who's always been different than everyone else. He's the hardest worker I know, and he's completely fearless. That hasn't served him well all of the time.\"</p><p>Two months after the spat with California regulators, Waymo filed suit against Uber. The long fall of Anthony Levandowski had begun.</p><p>Trade secrets take center stage</p><p>In June 2018, about 14 months before Levandowski's personal legal battle would begin, prosecutors from the U.S. District Court of Northern California charged six executives from wearables company Fitbit with stealing trade secrets from a former employer. Between the Waymo settlement with Uber and these cases, Silicon Valley engineers suddenly felt vulnerable to similar accusations.</p><p>But when the first of the Fitbit cases reached trial in January 2020, a federal grand jury took less than two hours of deliberation to acquit the defendant, Katherine Mogal, of all charges. Charges against the remaining defendants were subsequently dropped.</p><p>Evidence in the Mogal case centered on documents on her personal computer. In an era when so many people work remotely and outside traditional business hours, jurors could not determine what constituted stolen documents or ones that employees had merely saved on home devices in the normal course of their work.</p><p>\"Companies think that if they keep information confidential, that it's a trade secret, and that's absolutely not true,\" said Sharon Sandeen, director of the Intellectual Property Institute and professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minn.</p><p>In the civil case between Waymo and Uber, Levandowski's lawyers argued the approximately 14,000 documents downloaded in December 2015 were part of automatic and regular transfers to his home computer. Waymo engineer Sasha Zbrozek, who designed the server that held the documents, had told lawyers during the course of the investigation that the files were \"low value,\" according to court filings.</p><p>Separately, Zbrozek would say that conducting a \"checkout\" of documents was common practice and that \"it makes me uncomfortable that lawyers are trying to ascribe suspicion to it.\"</p><p>Sandeen says there are three distinct requirements for information to be considered a trade secret: It must be a secret, not a generally known bit of knowledge; it must have economic value because of its secrecy; companies must engage in efforts to maintain that secrecy.</p><p>Further, provisions in trade-secret law allow employees to bring general knowledge with them to new jobs. Silicon Valley overall has thrived for decades with a culture that promotes such movement.</p><p>\"The problem is, you have a situation like this, with some new technology or initiative, and all the sudden there's a switch in culture,\" Sandeen said. \"People start getting more proprietary, and open-innovation norms that existed don't exist anymore.\"</p><p>The government's defeat in the Fitbit trial and subsequent retreat from further cases served as a backdrop to the conclusion of Levandowski's case. Levandowski reached a plea agreement with the same Northern California prosecutors on March 19. Headlines in publications across the country noted his guilty plea, but they did not capture the substance of the agreement.</p><p>He faced 33 felony counts related to theft and attempted theft of trade secrets. Thirty-two of those counts involved accusations related to Google's internally developed lidar - receiver schematics, motor designs, circuit boards, calibration instructions, etc.</p><p>In the end, he pleaded guilty to a charge that had almost nothing to do with the technology Google described as a business differentiator.</p><p>Levandowski confessed to downloading 20 documents, including one called \"Chauffeur TL weekly updates - Q4 2015.\" Stored on Google Drive, the document was an ongoing status report of Google's self-driving car program, containing quarterly goals and weekly metrics, according to his plea agreement. It contained his team's OKRs - objectives and key results - and summaries of technical challenges faced by the overall program.</p><p>It was not lidar secrets, but it still carries substantial consequences. He admitted to taking the file to use for his own benefit and that he intended to use the weekly update for \"the economic benefit of somebody other than the owner\" with the knowledge that it would injure Google's economic position.</p><p>In a separate hearing two weeks earlier, an arbitration panel had ordered Levandowski to pay Google $179 million in damages, upholding a ruling that he engaged in deceptive and unfair practices when he siphoned Google employees to his trucking startup. He then filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>An uncertain future</p><p>At the coffee shop in December, Levandowski declined to discuss the specifics of the charges against him. That was partially tactical; the case was ongoing. But beyond the advice of his lawyers, it seemed Levandowski viewed the wringing over his own particular fate as a distraction from a larger concern - a self-driving industry beset with problems and delayed deployment time frames.</p><p>Industry lobbyists have blamed a patchwork of regulations that vary from state to state as a contributing factor to the delayed rollout of self-driving technology. But Levandowski defends the regulators he once circumvented.</p><p>\"Regulators are a scapegoat,\" he says. \"The real problem is that it's not ready.\"</p><p>In 2008, as part of his efforts at 510 Systems, he conducted the first autonomous pizza delivery, using one of the company's Toyota Priuses, with a police escort, to travel from the San Francisco waterfront, across the Bay Bridge and to Treasure Island. A dozen years later, he laments that not much has improved.</p><p>\"I'm disappointed,\" he says of the industry he helped create. \"We're far out. There's a fundamental breakthrough that's needed. This is not that 'we built an airplane, and we're figuring out the wing configuration.' This is, 'we built an airplane, and we don't know how to make it fly.' \"</p><p>Such a view may not be widely accepted, but it's no longer an outlier. Billions have been spent. Millions of testing miles have been driven, the value of which is increasingly scrutinized. Autonomous vehicles remain a bold and ambitious project, but in the meantime, there's an intermediate step with lifesaving potential. Instead of waiting for self-driving cars, traffic deaths can be addressed today with advanced driver-assist systems.</p><p>In July 2018, Levandowski co- founded Pronto.ai, a company developing driver-assist systems tailored for the trucking industry. He stepped down as CEO when the trade-secret indictment arrived. But over the past year, his faith in driver-assist systems has only grown more resolute.</p><p>Levandowski has been accused of disregarding safety over the years. Most notably, a New Yorker article alleges a 2011 incident in which he was behind the wheel of a Google self-driving test vehicle, which boxed in a Toyota Camry. The Camry subsequently spun out of control along a California roadway, and in swerving to avoid it, the article says, Levandowski injured a colleague who was his passenger.</p><p>He bristles at the idea he's cut safety corners, arguing he's doing more to save lives today than those focused solely on a fully driverless tomorrow.</p><p>\"Everyone who says they're building self-driving cars for safety reasons, they're whitewashing their efforts,\" he says. \"If you replace a driver, that's a moneymaking opportunity. If you think that's happening next week, go work on that. If you think it's not happening for another 10 years, look at these incremental systems that are saving lives today.\"</p><p>No limits</p><p>Frustrations with the pace of self-driving developments aside, Levandowski remains bullish on the long-term prospects of artificial intelligence.</p><p>When Uber fired him in May 2017, he turned his attention toward that future, diving into his self-appointed role as dean of the self-created Way of the Future, a church devoted to the worship of AI. Outsiders thought it was a prank or perhaps a means to shelter his fortune. But he says his intentions are genuine.</p><p>\"AI has amazing potential that will surpass humans,\" he says. \"I don't think there's a limit to how good it will be, and I want that to be beneficial for society. The whole reason it's a church is that it strips away financial motivations. It turns a primary motivation of 'How can we make money?' to 'How can we use this to solve problems and potentially take care of the planet?' \"</p><p>If exploring those far-reaching impacts of AI are part of Levandowski's future, he cannot yet escape the present. Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 4. Federal guidelines suggest he will spend 24 to 30 months in prison.</p><p>\"Mr. Levandowski is a young man with enormous talents and much to contribute to the fast-moving world of AI and AV,\" Miles Ehrlich, his attorney, said in a written statement. \"We hope this plea will allow him to move on with his life and focus his energies where they matter most.\"</p><p>Recently divorced, bankrupt and an admitted thief, Levandowski has seen much of the legacy he created now in tatters. One small part remains intact: GhostRider, the self-driving motorcycle that launched his career, resides in the Smithsonian Institution.</p><p>Miller, his friend, laments all that has been squandered. But he's reassured by the beliefs it's only served to invigorate Levandowski and that a long road ahead remains.</p><p>\"Certainly, he made a mistake with the files that has cost him a few years of his life already and will probably cost him a few more,\" he said. \"In a certain way, that's humbling. At the same time, he is who he is. He's not going to get out and take a job at a coding desk. Day one, he's going to be right back at it. Knowing him, I don't think this is the final chapter at all.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUTONW-5032957</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUTONW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJY-K8Y1-DYFH-V02G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6928</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3283\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Crain Communications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Automotive News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23747\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 94</volume><edition>Print Version</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 30, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He noted that there's an important role for governments to play and that as the European Union and the U.S. start drawing up their own approaches to regulation, \"international alignment\" of any eventual rules will be critical. He did not provide specific proposals. Pichai spoke on the same day he was scheduled to meet the EU's powerful competition regulator, Margrethe Vestager. She's also due to meet Microsoft President Brad Smith separately on Monday. Vestager has in previous years hit the Silicon Valley giant with multibillion-dollar fines for allegedly abusing its market dominance to choke off competition. After being reappointed for a second term last autumn with expanded powers over digital technology policies, Vestager has now set her sights on artificial intelligence, and is drawing up rules on its ethical use. Pichai's comments suggest the company may be hoping to head off a broad-based crackdown by the EU on the technology. Vestager and the EU have been the among the more aggressive regulators of big tech firms, an approach U.S. authorities have picked up with investigations into the dominance of companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon. \"Sensible regulation must also take a proportionate approach, balancing potential harms with social opportunities,\" he said, adding that it could incorporate existing standards like Europe's tough General Data Protection Regulation rather than starting from scratch. While it promises big benefits, he raised concerns about potential downsides of artificial intelligence, citing as one example its role in facial recognition technology, which can be used to find missing people but also for \"nefarious reasons\" which he didn't specify. In 2018, Google pledged not to use AI in applications related to weapons, surveillance that violates international norms, or that works in ways that go against human rights. Pichai was also due on Monday to meet Frans Timmermans, the EU commissioner overseeing the European Green Deal, the bloc's plan to fight climate change by making the continent carbon neutral by 2050, including through technology. He's then scheduled to head to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001141808</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1K-XHR1-JBRC-V004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"458\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Congress and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/technology/state-ag-tech-investigations.html\">state attorneys general</url> have their sights on the companies, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is no shortage of people arguing that America\u2019s large technology companies \u2014 namely Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 have gotten too big and too powerful. That has helped spur the scrutiny by the government officials.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what to do about the issue? On that, the industry\u2019s critics are split.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some would like to see the businesses broken up. Others want more robust regulation. And there are shades of gray on both sides. Here are four of the most prominent prescriptions being debated.</p><p>Bright-Line Breakups</p><p>This is the most drastic surgery, splitting off large portions of the big tech companies.</p><p>The guiding principle is simple. If you own a dominant online marketplace or platform, you cannot also offer the goods, services and software applications sold on that marketplace.</p><p>So Amazon could not own the leading e-commerce marketplace and sell Amazon-label goods there. Or Google could not have both the dominant search engine and its Google Shopping service, which shows up in search results. Apple could own an app store that offers music services, but not also its own music service sold there. And so on.</p><p>Bundling businesses on top of a dominant platform invites conflicts of interest and discrimination against rivals, thwarting competition, proponents of this countermeasure say.</p><p>\u201cThe world is going to be better off after we break up these companies,\u201d said Barry Lynn, executive director of Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has embraced the idea of bright-line breakups in her presidential campaign.</p><p>But such a sweeping overhaul of the tech industry could bring unknown risks for the companies and shareholders. Many economists are leery of broadly prohibiting companies from entering new businesses, fearing potential losses of efficiency and consumer welfare.</p><p>The last big government-mandated breakup targeted AT&amp;amp;T in the early 1980s, and that was the dissolution of a government-granted monopoly.</p><p>Still, the idea is not unthinkable. The remedy initially proposed in the government\u2019s antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, endorsed by three leading economists, was to split the Windows operating system business from Microsoft\u2019s Office productivity software business. After George W. Bush was elected president, his administration settled the case without a breakup.</p><p>Selective Split-Ups</p><p>This is a case-by-case approach to breakups rather than a broad rule applied to all the tech giants. A current example is a plan that would require Facebook to shed Instagram and WhatsApp. A detailed proposal on this, laying out the alleged anticompetitive conduct, was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/technology/chris-hughes-facebook-breakup.html\">developed by two leading antitrust scholars</url>, Tim Wu of Columbia Law School and Scott Hemphill of New York University Law School, along with Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. (Mr. Wu is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.)</p><p>The three have made their presentation to federal and state antitrust regulators and to congressional investigators. They explain that starting about 2010, when mobile computing and photo-sharing services were taking off and Facebook was lagging in those areas, the social network embarked on a yearslong campaign to buy nascent competitors.</p><p>The biggest purchases were of the photo-sharing service Instagram in 2012 and the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014.</p><p>Typically, regulators challenge mergers when they give a company a big share of an established market. That was not the case when Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram, a start-up with 13 employees in an emerging field.</p><p>Instead, the three argue, the strategy was to buy out budding threats. \u201cWe think that\u2019s the better perspective of what was going on \u2014 maintenance of monopoly in the social network market,\u201d Mr. Hemphill said.</p><p>In Facebook\u2019s case, Mr. Wu said, \u201cthe remedy is straightforward: Unwind the acquisitions.\u201d</p><p>But an issue in spinning off a unit like Instagram is whether doing so enhances competition. Would a stand-alone Instagram be a real rival to Facebook, or would consumers simply stay with the dominant social network, Facebook, and Instagram suffer?</p><p>A New Tech Watchdog</p><p>Getting breakups approved by the nation\u2019s courts, which are generally conservative on economic matters, would be a stretch. Besides, some experts argue, a more comprehensive way to police the big tech companies would be with a beefed-up force of regulators.</p><p>One idea is the creation of a new regulator, a Digital Authority. It would be an expert group to supplement traditional antitrust regulators in the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. It would be able to move faster and have the expertise to constantly track the tech markets and trends.</p><p>\u201cIts mandate would be to protect competition,\u201d said Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale University School of Management.</p><p>The new regulator was the central recommendation of <url normalizedValue=\"https://research.chicagobooth.edu/-/media/research/stigler/pdfs/market-structure-report.pdf\">a recent report</url> about the digital platforms that was sponsored by the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago. Ms. Scott Morton led a group of eight antitrust experts and technologists who worked on the study. Since the report was released in May, members of the group have made a series of presentations to policymakers.</p><p>In online markets, the flywheel of network effects \u2014 the more people who use a service, the more users, developers and advertisers it attracts \u2014 is especially powerful, creating dominant companies. Yet even in digital markets, the door to new entrants must remain open, said Ms. Scott Morton, a former senior official in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.</p><p>In traditional antitrust, regulators and courts move at a measured pace, slowly and often after the fact. The goal of a new digital regulator, she said, \u201cwould be to save the rival before it is killed.\u201d</p><p>The authority, Ms. Scott Morton said, could receive a complaint from a competitor and schedule a hearing two weeks later, when both sides would present testimony.</p><p>A new regulator? It would be a tough sell in today\u2019s political environment. But we do have specialist federal regulators in many other industries, including banking, aviation, transportation, drugs and agriculture.</p><p>Reining in the big tech companies, Ms. Scott Morton said, is increasingly becoming a bipartisan concern. \u201cAt some point, society will say this is too much power without real oversight,\u201d she said.</p><p>Unlock the Data</p><p>There are also narrower, targeted regulatory proposals. Some of these involve rules that would loosen a dominant company\u2019s control of user data, by either forcing that company to share the data with a smaller competitor or giving users more ability to take their data from one service and move it to a competitor. The Stigler Center study cited those data moves in a list of potential regulations and enforcement actions.</p><p>The idea, broadly, is that data can be a barrier to competition, and that freeing up the personal information collected by the tech giants could lower that barrier.</p><p>The big online platforms are data monetization machines, collecting, analyzing and exploiting information from consumers, merchants, advertisers and others. And the network effect of data is formidable. The more data the companies have, the more fuel to feed the machine-learning algorithms that power their businesses.</p><p>\u201cData is the real trump card these platforms have,\u201d said A. Douglas Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School and a member of the Stigler Center study team.</p><p>Mr. Melamed, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, favors a rule that would require dominant digital platforms to give other companies access to their user data for a fee. That would help level the playing field for new entrants and other rivals, he said, but wouldn\u2019t be free for them, either.</p><p>\u201cYou let the competitors have access to their back rooms for a reasonable fee,\u201d Mr. Melamed said. Such a solution would require regulatory oversight to set guidelines for fair licensing terms. Data sharing would also entail some privacy risk, since no privacy-protection technique is foolproof.</p><p>A related idea is to mandate that tech companies make user data portable. That means consumers could move their information from one service to another, forcing digital businesses to compete with superior offerings rather than data lock-in.</p><p>The regulator would need the technical skills to ensure that the consumer data was handed over in a way that would let a competitor use it easily.</p><p>\u201cThe details are crucial, if you\u2019re really going to give consumers more choice and control,\u201d said Jamie Morgenstern, a computer scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who worked on the study.</p><p>Steve Lohr covers technology and economics.

The effort announced Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission and its new chairman, Joe Simons, includes 15 or more public sessions in a series of cities that have yet to be announced. The hearings are expected to touch on a wide array of topics like the agency's \"remedial authority\" to address privacy and security abuses, the potential risks posed by big data, and the commission's tools to enforce antitrust laws as media, tech and telecom companies gobble each other up or seek to enter new lines of business. The public outreach will begin in September and continue into January 2019, the agency said. </p><p>It could presage tougher scrutiny of Silicon Valley in response to complaints that the FTC has been too soft on tech giants and the ways they collect, swap and manipulate personal information about billions of Americans. \"When the FTC periodically engages in serious reflection and evaluation, we are better able to promote competition and innovation, protect consumers, and shape the law, so that free markets continue to thrive,\" Simons said in a statement. Simons has modeled the effort after an inquiry conducted by the FTC in 1995, the agency said, three years before Google had been founded and almost 10 years before the launch of Facebook. Those previous hearings similarly sought to gauge if the agency had the right tools to tackle issues that included the arrival of online shopping and the threat of digital fraud. Back then, FTC leaders sought to \"understand how antitrust law ought to apply to new dominant firms who got there often because they were the first to invent or first to implement a really good idea,\" said Bill Baer, who served at the FTC during that period and much later became the top antitrust official at the Justice Department under President Barack Obama. Two decades later, some of those same challenges remain. But FTC under Simons also faces significant pressure to rein in the power and footprint of the country's tech giants. Privacy experts see the agency's ongoing investigation of Facebook, for example, as a major test of the FTC's ability and willingness to penalize Silicon Valley for its alleged misdeeds. \"Their budget is sort of insanely low,\" said Michelle De Mooy, the director of the Privacy and Data Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington D.C.-based think tank. She noted the agency is limited in the rules it can write on its own and the staff it can hire, too. \"Making sure they are able to be effective, now that they are faced with so many emerging technologies, is absolutely crucial for effective consumer protection,\" she said. For now, the road trip marks the first major initiative from Simons, an antitrust lawyer by trade who arrived at the agency in May along with a full slate of new Democratic and Republican commissioners. Before his Senate confirmation, many lawmakers had pressed Simons on the extent to which he'd keep a close eye on the biggest tech companies in Silicon Valley. In response, Simons promised the FTC under his watch would be \"vigorously enforcing the antitrust laws.\" Along with privacy and security, Simons faces new demands \u2014 including from lawmakers on Capitol Hill \u2014 that the FTC stop big tech companies from getting bigger. Some members of Congress are specifically asking the FTC to reopen its investigation of Google, which the agency previously probed for antitrust violations but closed its investigation in 2013 without bringing any significant penalties. In the meantime, European regulators slapped Google with a major fine. While those companies aren't the explicit focus of the FTC's forthcoming hearings, the agency could hear an earful about them.

The hearings are expected to touch on topics like the agency's \"remedial authority\" to address privacy and security abuses, the potential risks posed by big data, and the commission's tools to enforce antitrust laws as media, tech and telecom companies gobble each other up or seek to enter new lines of business.</p><p>The public outreach will begin in September and continue into January 2019, the agency said. It could presage tougher scrutiny of Silicon Valley in response to complaints that the FTC has been too soft on tech giants and the ways they collect, swap and manipulate personal information about billions of people.</p><p>\"When the FTC periodically engages in serious reflection and evaluation, we are better able to promote competition and innovation, protect consumers, and shape the law, so that free markets continue to thrive,\" Simons said in a statement.</p><p>Simons has modeled the effort after an inquiry conducted by the FTC in 1995, the agency said, three years before Google had been founded and almost 10 years before the launch of Facebook. Those previous hearings similarly sought to gauge\u00a0whether the agency had the right tools to tackle issues that included the arrival of online shopping and the threat of digital fraud.</p><p>Back then, FTC leaders sought to \"understand how antitrust law ought to apply to new dominant firms who got there often because they were the first to invent or first to implement a really good idea,\" said Bill Baer, who served at the FTC\u00a0during that period\u00a0and much later became the top antitrust official at the Justice Department under President Barack Obama.</p><p>Two decades later, some of those same challenges remain. But the FTC under Simons\u00a0also faces significant pressure to rein in the power and footprint of the country's tech giants. Privacy experts see the agency's ongoing investigation of Facebook, for example, as a major test of its ability and willingness to penalize Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"Their budget is sort of insanely low,\" said Michelle De Mooy, the director of the Privacy and Data Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a D.C.-based think tank. She noted the agency is limited in the rules it can write on its own and the staff it can hire.</p><p>\"Making sure they are able to be effective, now that they are faced with so many emerging technologies, is absolutely crucial for effective consumer protection,\" she said.</p><p>For now, the road trip marks the first major initiative from Simons, an antitrust lawyer by trade who arrived at the agency in May along with a full slate of new Democratic and Republican commissioners.</p><p>Before his Senate confirmation, many lawmakers had pressed Simons on the extent to which he\u00a0would keep a close eye on the biggest tech companies in Silicon Valley. In response, Simons promised the FTC under his watch would be \"vigorously enforcing the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>Along with privacy and security, Simons faces new demands - including from lawmakers on Capitol Hill - that the FTC stop big tech companies from getting bigger. Some members of Congress are specifically asking the FTC to reopen its investigation of Google, which the agency previously probed for antitrust violations but closed its investigation of in 2013 without bringing any significant penalties. In the meantime, European regulators slapped Google with a major fine.</p><p>While those companies aren't the explicit focus of the FTC's forthcoming hearings, the agency could hear an earful about them. The goal, the agency said, is to explore whether \"broad-based changes in the economy, evolving business practices, new technologies or international developments might require any adjustments to competition and consumer protection enforcement law, enforcement priorities, and policy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-97e3c85f12364048aa73d500a2cb36ca</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SKX-NKH1-DXKP-J4BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"712\"/><timeReceived>3:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 20, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Uber disrupts public transit. Palantir augments security. SpaceX plots our exodus to Mars. And when the Defense Department modernizes its computing infrastructure by awarding its $10\u00a0billion JEDI contract to Amazon (or one of the less likely contenders), it will be another indication that Washington can't go it alone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Washington isn't moving toward a privatization that encourages competition, as was theoretically true of classical procurement. Big tech is building new dependencies in government and giving businesses powers over the executive branch that would make Congress salivate. In a sense, Silicon Valley is slowly becoming a potential check and balance on executive authority.</p><p>Consider what happened when a small minority of Google employees feared that working on defense-related issues might compromise their ethics. They objected to the JEDI contract and Google bowed out, in part, because it couldn't be assured the work \"would align with our AI Principles.\" These artificial intelligence principles had been written less than three months prior in response to another employee protest against a different Pentagon contract.</p><p>Up in Seattle, Amazon and Microsoft are facing an impending battle regarding the use of facial recognition software by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. After a Freedom of Information Act request revealed that Amazon was soliciting ICE as a customer, dozens of employees signed petitions decrying the possible use of Amazon's surveillance system on the southern border. No contracts have been signed yet by the company. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.) </p><p>The most famous policy battle happened two years ago when the world's largest company exercised control over its dominion: Apple chief executive Tim Cook refrained from helping the FBI get into a locked iPhone after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The phone was opened without Apple's consent, but the case is hardly settled.</p><p>These policy rebukes are not driven by lobbyists in Washington; they're groundswells inside companies in California and Washington state. Never before have a handful of companies had the power to rebuke federal policy directly in matters of security, defense and immigration. Imagine that Delta Air Lines defied Homeland Security by refusing to abide by the TSA's No Fly List. It couldn't. But if Delta were one of the few airlines in the world, traveling faster than any competitors, it might have more pull. Tech companies today often have scale and singularity in their favor.</p><p>The tradeoffs of privatization did not begin with big tech. The Harvard Business Review warned of the privatization of government in 1991 shortly after the Reagan administration decreed \"don't just stand there, undo something.\" The era of denationalization began globally and hasn't declined. City governments, too, were reliant on companies for management of services, but tech accelerated the trend. Take Altamonte Springs, Fla., for example, which recently got rid of most city buses in lieu of offering subsidized Uber rides. Or Chicago, where Elon Musk's Boring Co. is paying to build a mass transit system to O'Hare International Airport. </p><p>The previous debate over privatization was a philosophical one - is this the kind of government we want? But this new debate is more pragmatic: How do we modernize the government's crumbling digital infrastructure without giving tech too much control?</p><p>The irony of these questions is that the vast majority of tech employees do not appear to want a diminished federal government. A recent Wired analysis of the midterm elections found that of the 125,000 political contributions by employees of Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, 23\u00a0percent went to Democratic candidates while roughly 1\u00a0percent funded Republicans. (The remainder went to issue-related causes.)  This great \"undoing\" of national government is being executed by self-proclaimed progressives who would cringe at the thought of enacting Reagan's utopia via software updates.</p><p>Still, it's clear this growing shift in power must be addressed. Some are floating the idea of a chief ethics officer at tech companies; others suggest something like the Federal Reserve Board, a body of nonpartisan experts and academics who are tasked with updating government-set standards and policies quarterly.</p><p>What's needed imminently, though, is a mind-set shift - not just by tech companies, but by elected officials who've long seen themselves as responders to disruption, not initiators of it. If companies continue to take on government functions, Washington will have to start acting more like a portfolio manager rather than a regulator, rewarding the companies that enact good practices and incentivizing tech companies to build for civic needs.</p><p>But until there's a Senate Committee on Technology Partnerships that's as active as the Foreign Relations Committee, Silicon Valley will remain a shadow capital, subsuming the roles of government as Washington slowly competes away its influence.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-d1216adcec4411e8baac2a674e91502b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSF-DDN1-JB4M-V2NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"884\"/><timeReceived>9:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002PDE</classCode><className>DELTA AIR LINES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Steve Jobs, John Sculley, and Steve Wozniak, 1984. One of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs's most audacious marketing triumphs is rarely mentioned in the paeans to his genius that remain a staple of business content farms. In 1982, Jobs offered to donate a computer to every K-12 school in America, provided Congress pass a bill giving Apple substantial tax write-offs for the donations. When he arrived in Washington, DC, to lobby for what became known as the Apple Bill, the 28-year-old CEO looked 'more like a summer intern than the head of a $600-million-a-year corporation,' according to The Washington Post, but he already showed signs of his famous arrogance. </p><p>He barraged the legislators with white papers and proclaimed that they 'would be crazy not to take us up on this.' Jobs knew the strength of his hand: A mania for computer literacy was sweeping the nation as an answer to the competitive threats of globalization and the reescalation of the Cold War's technology and space races. Yet even as preparing students for the Information Age became a national priority, the Reagan era's budget cuts meant that few schools could afford a brand-new $2,400 Apple II computer. Ad Policy[1] Books in Review  The Apple Bill passed the House overwhelmingly but then died in the Senate after a bureaucratic snafu for which Jobs forever blamed Republican Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, then chair of the Finance Committee. Yet all was not lost: A similar bill passed in California, and Apple flooded its home state with almost 10,000 computers. Apple's success in California gave it a leg up in the lucrative education market as states around the country began to computerize their classrooms. But education was not radically transformed, unless you count a spike in The Oregon Trail-related deaths from dysentery. If anything, those who have studied the rapid introduction of computers into classrooms in the 1980s and '90s tend to conclude that it exacerbated inequities. Elite students and schools zoomed smoothly into cyberspace, while poorer schools fell further behind, bogged down by a lack of training and resources. A young, charismatic geek hawks his wares using bold promises of social progress but actually makes things worse and gets extremely rich in the process\u2014today it is easy to see the story of the Apple Bill as a stand-in for the history of the digital revolution as a whole. The growing concern about the role that technology plays in our lives and society is fueled in no small part by a growing realization that we have been duped. We were told that computerizing everything would lead to greater prosperity, personal empowerment, collective understanding, even the ability to transcend the limits of the physical realm and create a big, beautiful global brain made out of electrons. Instead, our extreme dependence on technology seems to have mainly enriched and empowered a handful of tech companies at the expense of everyone else. The panic over Facebook's impact on democracy sparked by Donald Trump's election in a haze of fake news and Russian bots felt like the national version of the personal anxiety that seizes many of us when we find ourselves snapping away from our phone for what seems like the 1,000th time in an hour and contemplating how our lives are being stolen by a screen. We are stuck in a really bad system. This realization has led to a justifiable anger and derision aimed at the architects of this system. Silicon Valley executives and engineers are taken to task every week in the op-ed pages of our largest newspapers. We are told that their irresponsibility and greed have undermined our freedom and degraded our democratic institutions. While it is gratifying to see tech billionaires get a (very small) portion of their comeuppance, we often forget that until very recently, Silicon Valley was hailed by almost everyone as creating the path toward a brilliant future. Perhaps we should pause and contemplate how this situation came to be, lest we make the same mistakes again. The story of how Silicon Valley ended up at the center of the American dream in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, as well as the ambiguous reality behind its own techno-\u200butopian dreams, is the subject of Margaret O'Mara's sweeping new history, The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America. In it, she puts Silicon Valley into the context of a larger story about postwar America's economic and social transformations, highlighting its connections with the mainstream rather than the cultural quirks and business practices that set it apart. The Code urges us to consider Silicon Valley's shortcomings as America's shortcomings, even if it fails to interrogate them as deeply as our current crisis\u2014and the role that technology played in bringing it about\u2014seems to warrant. Silicon Valley entered the public consciousness in the 1970s as something of a charmed place. The first recorded mention of Silicon Valley was in a 1971 article by a writer for a technology newspaper reporting on the region's semiconductor industry, which was booming despite the economic doldrums that had descended on most of the country. As the Rust Belt foundered and Detroit crumbled, Silicon Valley soared to heights barely conveyed by the metrics that O'Mara rattles off in the opening pages of The Code: 'Three billion smartphones. Two billion social media users. Two trillion-dollar companies' and 'the richest people in the history of humanity.' Many people have attempted to divine the secret of Silicon Valley's success. The consensus became that the Valley had pioneered a form of quicksilver entrepreneurialism perfectly suited to the Information Age. It was fast, flexible, meritocratic, and open to new ways of doing things. It allowed brilliant young people to turn crazy ideas into world-changing companies practically overnight. Silicon Valley came to represent the innovative power of capitalism freed from the clutches of uptight men in midcentury business suits, bestowed upon the masses by a new, appealing folk hero: the cherub-faced start-up founder hacking away in his dorm room. The Code both bolsters and revises this story. On the one hand, O'Mara, a historian at the University of Washington, is clearly enamored with tales of entrepreneurial derring-do. From the 'traitorous eight' who broke dramatically from the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in 1957 to start Fairchild Semiconductor and create the modern silicon transistor to the well-documented story of Facebook's founding, the major milestones of Silicon Valley history are told in heroic terms that can seem gratingly out of touch, given what we know about how it all turned out. In her portrayal of Silicon Valley's tech titans, O'Mara emphasizes virtuous qualities like determination, ingenuity, and humanistic concern, while hints of darker motives are studiously ignored. We learn that a 'visionary and relentless' Jeff Bezos continued to drive a beat-up Honda Accord even as he became a billionaire, but his reported remark to an Amazon sales team that they ought to treat small publishers the way a lion treats a sickly gazelle is apparently not deemed worthy of the historical record. But at the same time, O'Mara helps us understand why Silicon Valley's economic dominance can't be chalked up solely to the grit and smarts of entrepreneurs battling it out in the free market. At every stage of its development, she shows how the booming tech industry was aided and abetted by a wide swath of American society both inside and outside the Valley. Marketing gurus shaped the tech companies' images, educators evangelized for technology in schools, best-selling futurists preached personalized tech as a means toward personal liberation. What emerges in The Code is less the story of a tribe of misfits working against the grain than the simultaneous alignment of the country's political, cultural, and technical elites around the view that Silicon Valley held the key to the future. Above all, O'Mara highlights the profound role that the US government played in Silicon Valley's rise. At the end of World War II, the region was still the sleepy, sun-drenched Santa Clara Valley, home to farms and orchards, an upstart Stanford University, and a scattering of small electronics and aerospace firms. Then came the space and arms races, given new urgency in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik, which suggested a serious Soviet advantage. Millions of dollars in government funding flooded technology companies and universities around the country. An outsize portion went to Northern California's burgeoning tech industry, thanks in large part to Stanford's far-sighted provost Frederick Terman, who reshaped the university into a hub for engineering and the applied sciences.  Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/october-21-2019-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/october-21-2019-issue/</url>Stanford and the surrounding area became a hive of government R...uring these years, as IBM and Lockheed Martin opened local outposts and the first native start-ups hit the ground. While these early companies relied on what O'Mara calls the Valley's 'ecosystem' of fresh-faced engineers seeking freedom and sunshine in California, venture capitalists sniffing out a profitable new industry, and lawyers, construction companies, and real estate agents jumping to serve their somewhat quirky ways, she makes it clear that the lifeblood pumping through it all was government money. Fairchild Semiconductor's biggest clients for its new silicon chips were NASA, which put them in the Apollo rockets, and the Defense Department, which stuck them in Minuteman nuclear missiles. The brains of all of today's devices have their origin in the United States' drive to defeat the Soviet Union in the Cold War. But the role of public funding in the creation of Silicon Valley is not the big government success story a good liberal might be tempted to consider it. As O'Mara points out, during the Cold War American leaders deliberately pushed public funds to private industry rather than government programs because they thought the market was the best way to spur technological progress while avoiding the specter of centralized planning, which had come to smack of communist tyranny. In the years that followed, this belief in the market as the means to achieve the goals of liberal democracy spread to nearly every aspect of life and society, from public education and health care to social justice, solidifying into the creed we now call neoliberalism. As the role of the state was eclipsed by the market, Silicon Valley\u2014full of brilliant entrepreneurs devising technologies that promised to revolutionize everything they touched\u2014was well positioned to step into the void. The earliest start-up founders hardly seemed eager to assume the mantle of social visionary that their successors, today's flashy celebrity technologists, happily take up. They were buttoned-down engineers who reflected the cool practicality of their major government and corporate clients. As the 1960s wore on, they were increasingly out of touch. Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement and the protests against the Vietnam War, the major concern in Silicon Valley's manicured technology parks was a Johnson-era drop in military spending. The relatively few techies who were political at the time were conservative. Things started to change in the 1970s. The '60s made a belated arrival in the Valley as a younger generation of geeks steeped in countercultural values began to apply them to the development of computer technology. The weight of Silicon Valley's culture shifted from the conservative suits to long-haired techno-utopians with dreams of radically reorganizing society through technology. This shift was perhaps best embodied by Lee Felsenstein, a former self-described 'child radical' who cut his teeth running communications operations for anti-war and civil rights protests before going on to develop the Tom Swift Terminal, one of the earliest personal computers. Felsenstein believed that giving everyday people access to computers could liberate them from the crushing hierarchy of modern industrial society by breaking the monopoly on information held by corporations and government bureaucracies. 'To change the rules, change the tools,' he liked to say. Whereas Silicon Valley had traditionally developed tools for the Man, these techies wanted to make tools to undermine him. They created a loose-knit network of hobbyist groups, drop-in computer centers, and DIY publications to share knowledge and work toward the ideal of personal liberation through technology. Their dreams seemed increasingly achievable as computers shrank from massive, room-filling mainframes to the smaller-room-filling minicomputers to, finally, in 1975, the first commercially viable personal computer, the Altair.  Yet as O'Mara shows, the techno-utopians did not ultimately constitute such a radical break from the past. While their calls to democratize computing may have echoed Marxist cries to seize the means of production, most were capitalists at heart. To advance the personal computer 'revolution,' they founded start-ups, trade magazines, and business forums, relying on funding from venture capital funds often with roots in the old money elite. Jobs became the most celebrated entrepreneur of the era by embodying the discordant figures of both the cowboy capitalist and the touchy-feely hippie, an image crafted in large part by the marketing guru Regis McKenna. Silicon Valley soon became an industry that looked a lot like those that had come before. It was nearly as white and male as they were. Its engineers worked soul-crushing hours and blew off steam with boozy pool parties. And its most successful company, Microsoft, clawed its way to the top through ruthless monopolistic tactics. Perhaps the strongest case against the supposed subversiveness of the personal computer pioneers is how quickly they were embraced by those in power. As profits rose and spectacular IPOs seized headlines throughout the 1980s, Silicon Valley was championed by the rising stars of supply-side economics, who hitched their drive for tax cuts and deregulation to tech's venture-capital-fueled rocket ship. The groundwork was laid in 1978, when the Valley's venture capitalists formed an alliance with the Republicans to kill then-President Jimmy Carter's proposed increase in the capital gains tax. They beta-\u200btested Reaganomics by advancing the dubious argument that millionaires' making slightly less money on their investments might stifle technological innovation by limiting the supply of capital available to start-ups. And they carried the day.  As president, Ronald Reagan doubled down with tax cuts and wild technophilia. In a truly trippy speech to students at Moscow State University in 1988, he hailed the transcendent possibilities of the new economy epitomized by Silicon Valley, predicting a future in which 'human innovation increasingly makes physical resources obsolete.' Meanwhile, the market-friendly New Democrats embraced the tech industry so enthusiastically that they became known, to their chagrin, as Atari Democrats. The media turned Silicon Valley entrepreneurs into international celebrities with flattering profiles and cover stories\u2014living proof that the mix of technological innovation, risk taking, corporate social responsibility, and lack of regulation that defined Silicon Valley in the popular imagination was the template for unending growth and prosperity, even in an era of deindustrialization and globalization. The near-universal celebration of Silicon Valley as an avatar of free-market capitalism in the 1980s helped ensure that the market would guide the Internet's development in the 1990s, as it became the cutting-edge technology that promised to change everything. The Internet began as an academic resource, first as ARPANET, funded and overseen by the Department of Defense, and later as the National Science Foundation's NSFNET. And while Al Gore didn't invent the Internet, he did spearhead the push to privatize it: As the Clinton administration's 'technology czar,' he helped develop its landmark National Information Infrastructure (NII) plan, which emphasized the role of private industry and the importance of telecommunications deregulation in constructing America's 'information superhighway.' Not surprisingly, Gore would later do a little-known turn as a venture capitalist with the prestigious Valley firm Kleiner Perkins, becoming very wealthy in the process. In response to his NII plan, the advocacy group Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility warned of a possible corporate takeover of the Internet. 'An imaginative view of the risks of an NII designed without sufficient attention to public-interest needs can be found in the modern genre of dystopian fiction known as 'cyberpunk,'' they wrote. 'Cyberpunk novelists depict a world in which a handful of multinational corporations have seized control, not only of the physical world, but of the virtual world of cyberspace.' Who can deny that today's commercial Internet has largely fulfilled this cyberpunk nightmare? Someone should ask Gore what he thinks. Despite offering evidence to the contrary, O'Mara narrates her tale of Silicon Valley's rise as, ultimately, a success story. At the end of the book, we see it as the envy of other states around the country and other countries around the world, an 'exuberantly capitalist, slightly anarchic tech ecosystem that had evolved over several generations.' Throughout the book, she highlights the many issues that have sparked increasing public consternation with Big Tech of late, from its lack of diversity to its stupendous concentration of wealth, but these are framed in the end as unfortunate side effects of the headlong rush to create a new and brilliant future. She hardly mentions the revelations by the National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden of the US government's chilling capacity to siphon users' most intimate information from Silicon Valley's platforms and the voraciousness with which it has done so. Nor does she grapple with Uber, which built its multibillion-dollar leviathan on the backs of meagerly paid drivers. The fact that in order to carry out almost anything online we must subject ourselves to a hypercommodified hellscape of targeted advertising and algorithmic sorting does not appear to be a huge cause for concern. But these and many other aspects of our digital landscape have made me wonder if a technical complex born out of Cold War militarism and mainstreamed in a free-market frenzy might not be fundamentally always at odds with human flourishing. O'Mara suggests at the end of her book that Silicon Valley's flaws might be redeemed by a new, more enlightened, and more diverse generation of techies. But haven't we heard this story before? If there is a larger lesson to learn from The Code, it is that technology cannot be separated from the social and political contexts in which it is created. The major currents in society shape and guide the creation of a system that appears to spring from the minds of its inventors alone. Militarism and unbridled capitalism remain among the most powerful forces in the United States, and to my mind, there is no reason to believe that a new generation of techies might resist them any more effectively than the previous ones. The question of fixing Silicon Valley is inseparable from the question of fixing the system of postwar American capitalism, of which it is perhaps the purest expression. Some believe that the problems we see are bugs that might be fixed with a patch. Others think the code is so bad at its core that a radical rewrite is the only answer. Although The Code was written for people in the first group, it offers an important lesson for those of us in the second: Silicon Valley is as much a symptom as it is a cause of our current crisis. Resisting its bad influence on society will ultimately prove meaningless if we cannot also formulate a vision of a better world\u2014one with a more humane relationship to technology\u2014to counteract it. And, alas, there is no app for that.

In 1982, Jobs offered to donate a computer to every K-12 school in America, provided Congress pass a bill giving Apple substantial tax write-offs for the donations. When he arrived in Washington, DC, to lobby for what became known as the Apple Bill, the 28-year-old CEO looked \"more like a summer intern than the head of a $600-million-a-year corporation,\" according to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis>, but he already showed signs of his famous arrogance. He barraged the legislators with white papers and proclaimed that they \"would be crazy not to take us up on this.\" Jobs knew the strength of his hand: A mania for computer literacy was sweeping the nation as an answer to the competitive threats of globalization and the reescalation of the Cold War's technology and space races. Yet even as preparing students for the Information Age became a national priority, the Reagan era's budget cuts meant that few schools could afford a brand-new $2,400 Apple II computer.</p><p>The Apple Bill passed the House overwhelmingly but then died in the Senate after a bureaucratic snafu for which Jobs forever blamed Republican Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, then chair of the Finance Committee. Yet all was not lost: A similar bill passed in California, and Apple flooded its home state with almost 10,000 computers. Apple's success in California gave it a leg up in the lucrative education market as states around the country began to computerize their classrooms. But education was not radically transformed, unless you count a spike in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Oregon Trail</emphasis>-related deaths from dysentery. If anything, those who have studied the rapid introduction of computers into classrooms in the 1980s and '90s tend to conclude that it exacerbated inequities. Elite students and schools zoomed smoothly into cyberspace, while poorer schools fell further behind, bogged down by a lack of training and resources.</p><p>A young, charismatic geek hawks his wares using bold promises of social progress but actually makes things worse and gets extremely rich in the process-today it is easy to see the story of the Apple Bill as a stand-in for the history of the digital revolution as a whole. The growing concern about the role that technology plays in our lives and society is fueled in no small part by a growing realization that we have been duped. We were told that computerizing everything would lead to greater prosperity, personal empowerment, collective understanding, even the ability to transcend the limits of the physical realm and create a big, beautiful global brain made out of electrons. Instead, our extreme dependence on technology seems to have mainly enriched and empowered a handful of tech companies at the expense of everyone else. The panic over Facebook's impact on democracy sparked by Donald Trump's election in a haze of fake news and Russian bots felt like the national version of the personal anxiety that seizes many of us when we find ourselves snapping away from our phone for what seems like the 1,000th time in an hour and contemplating how our lives are being stolen by a screen. We are stuck in a really bad system.</p><p>This realization has led to a justifiable anger and derision aimed at the architects of this system. Silicon Valley executives and engineers are taken to task every week in the op-ed pages of our largest newspapers. We are told that their irresponsibility and greed have undermined our freedom and degraded our democratic institutions. While it is gratifying to see tech billionaires get a (very small) portion of their comeuppance, we often forget that until very recently, Silicon Valley was hailed by almost everyone as creating the path toward a brilliant future. Perhaps we should pause and contemplate how this situation came to be, lest we make the same mistakes again. The story of how Silicon Valley ended up at the center of the American dream in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, as well as the ambiguous reality behind its own techno-\u200butopian dreams, is the subject of Margaret O'Mara's sweeping new history, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America</emphasis>. In it, she puts Silicon Valley into the context of a larger story about postwar America's economic and social transformations, highlighting its connections with the mainstream rather than the cultural quirks and business practices that set it apart. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code</emphasis> urges us to consider Silicon Valley's shortcomings as America's shortcomings, even if it fails to interrogate them as deeply as our current crisis-and the role that technology played in bringing it about-seems to warrant.</p><p>ilicon Valley entered the public consciousness in the 1970s as something of a charmed place. The first recorded mention of Silicon Valley was in a 1971 article by a writer for a technology newspaper reporting on the region's semiconductor industry, which was booming despite the economic doldrums that had descended on most of the country. As the Rust Belt foundered and Detroit crumbled, Silicon Valley soared to heights barely conveyed by the metrics that O'Mara rattles off in the opening pages of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code</emphasis>: \"Three billion smartphones. Two billion social media users. Two trillion-dollar companies\" and \"the richest people in the history of humanity.\" Many people have attempted to divine the secret of Silicon Valley's success. The consensus became that the Valley had pioneered a form of quicksilver entrepreneurialism perfectly suited to the Information Age. It was fast, flexible, meritocratic, and open to new ways of doing things. It allowed brilliant young people to turn crazy ideas into world-changing companies practically overnight. Silicon Valley came to represent the innovative power of capitalism freed from the clutches of uptight men in midcentury business suits, bestowed upon the masses by a new, appealing folk hero: the cherub-faced start-up founder hacking away in his dorm room.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code</emphasis> both bolsters and revises this story. On the one hand, O'Mara, a historian at the University of Washington, is clearly enamored with tales of entrepreneurial derring-do. From the \"traitorous eight\" who broke dramatically from the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in 1957 to start Fairchild Semiconductor and create the modern silicon transistor to the well-documented story of Facebook's founding, the major milestones of Silicon Valley history are told in heroic terms that can seem gratingly out of touch, given what we know about how it all turned out. In her portrayal of Silicon Valley's tech titans, O'Mara emphasizes virtuous qualities like determination, ingenuity, and humanistic concern, while hints of darker motives are studiously ignored. We learn that a \"visionary and relentless\" Jeff Bezos continued to drive a beat-up Honda Accord even as he became a billionaire, but his reported remark to an Amazon sales team that they ought to treat small publishers the way a lion treats a sickly gazelle is apparently not deemed worthy of the historical record. But at the same time, O'Mara helps us understand why Silicon Valley's economic dominance can't be chalked up solely to the grit and smarts of entrepreneurs battling it out in the free market. At every stage of its development, she shows how the booming tech industry was aided and abetted by a wide swath of American society both inside and outside the Valley. Marketing gurus shaped the tech companies' images, educators evangelized for technology in schools, best-selling futurists preached personalized tech as a means toward personal liberation. What emerges in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code</emphasis> is less the story of a tribe of misfits working against the grain than the simultaneous alignment of the country's political, cultural, and technical elites around the view that Silicon Valley held the key to the future.</p><p>Above all, O'Mara highlights the profound role that the US government played in Silicon Valley's rise. At the end of World War II, the region was still the sleepy, sun-drenched Santa Clara Valley, home to farms and orchards, an upstart Stanford University, and a scattering of small electronics and aerospace firms. Then came the space and arms races, given new urgency in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik, which suggested a serious Soviet advantage. Millions of dollars in government funding flooded technology companies and universities around the country. An outsize portion went to Northern California's burgeoning tech industry, thanks in large part to Stanford's far-sighted provost Frederick Terman, who reshaped the university into a hub for engineering and the applied sciences.</p><p>Stanford and the surrounding area became a hive of government R&amp;D during these years, as IBM and Lockheed Martin opened local outposts and the first native start-ups hit the ground. While these early companies relied on what O'Mara calls the Valley's \"ecosystem\" of fresh-faced engineers seeking freedom and sunshine in California, venture capitalists sniffing out a profitable new industry, and lawyers, construction companies, and real estate agents jumping to serve their somewhat quirky ways, she makes it clear that the lifeblood pumping through it all was government money. Fairchild Semiconductor's biggest clients for its new silicon chips were NASA, which put them in the Apollo rockets, and the Defense Department, which stuck them in Minuteman nuclear missiles. The brains of all of today's devices have their origin in the United States' drive to defeat the Soviet Union in the Cold War.</p><p>But the role of public funding in the creation of Silicon Valley is not the big government success story a good liberal might be tempted to consider it. As O'Mara points out, during the Cold War American leaders deliberately pushed public funds to private industry rather than government programs because they thought the market was the best way to spur technological progress while avoiding the specter of centralized planning, which had come to smack of communist tyranny. In the years that followed, this belief in the market as the means to achieve the goals of liberal democracy spread to nearly every aspect of life and society, from public education and health care to social justice, solidifying into the creed we now call neoliberalism. As the role of the state was eclipsed by the market, Silicon Valley-full of brilliant entrepreneurs devising technologies that promised to revolutionize everything they touched-was well positioned to step into the void.</p><p>he earliest start-up founders hardly seemed eager to assume the mantle of social visionary that their successors, today's flashy celebrity technologists, happily take up. They were buttoned-down engineers who reflected the cool practicality of their major government and corporate clients. As the 1960s wore on, they were increasingly out of touch. Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement and the protests against the Vietnam War, the major concern in Silicon Valley's manicured technology parks was a Johnson-era drop in military spending. The relatively few techies who were political at the time were conservative.</p><p>Things started to change in the 1970s. The '60s made a belated arrival in the Valley as a younger generation of geeks steeped in countercultural values began to apply them to the development of computer technology. The weight of Silicon Valley's culture shifted from the conservative suits to long-haired techno-utopians with dreams of radically reorganizing society through technology. This shift was perhaps best embodied by Lee Felsenstein, a former self-described \"child radical\" who cut his teeth running communications operations for anti-war and civil rights protests before going on to develop the Tom Swift Terminal, one of the earliest personal computers. Felsenstein believed that giving everyday people access to computers could liberate them from the crushing hierarchy of modern industrial society by breaking the monopoly on information held by corporations and government bureaucracies. \"To change the rules, change the tools,\" he liked to say. Whereas Silicon Valley had traditionally developed tools for the Man, these techies wanted to make tools to undermine him. They created a loose-knit network of hobbyist groups, drop-in computer centers, and DIY publications to share knowledge and work toward the ideal of personal liberation through technology. Their dreams seemed increasingly achievable as computers shrank from massive, room-filling mainframes to the smaller-room-filling minicomputers to, finally, in 1975, the first commercially viable personal computer, the Altair.</p><p>Yet as O'Mara shows, the techno-utopians did not ultimately constitute such a radical break from the past. While their calls to democratize computing may have echoed Marxist cries to seize the means of production, most were capitalists at heart. To advance the personal computer \"revolution,\" they founded start-ups, trade magazines, and business forums, relying on funding from venture capital funds often with roots in the old money elite. Jobs became the most celebrated entrepreneur of the era by embodying the discordant figures of both the cowboy capitalist and the touchy-feely hippie, an image crafted in large part by the marketing guru Regis McKenna. Silicon Valley soon became an industry that looked a lot like those that had come before. It was nearly as white and male as they were. Its engineers worked soul-crushing hours and blew off steam with boozy pool parties. And its most successful company, Microsoft, clawed its way to the top through ruthless monopolistic tactics.</p><p>Perhaps the strongest case against the supposed subversiveness of the personal computer pioneers is how quickly they were embraced by those in power. As profits rose and spectacular IPOs seized headlines throughout the 1980s, Silicon Valley was championed by the rising stars of supply-side economics, who hitched their drive for tax cuts and deregulation to tech's venture-capital-fueled rocket ship. The groundwork was laid in 1978, when the Valley's venture capitalists formed an alliance with the Republicans to kill then-President Jimmy Carter's proposed increase in the capital gains tax. They beta-\u200btested Reaganomics by advancing the dubious argument that millionaires' making slightly less money on their investments might stifle technological innovation by limiting the supply of capital available to start-ups. And they carried the day.</p><p>As president, Ronald Reagan doubled down with tax cuts and wild technophilia. In a truly trippy speech to students at Moscow State University in 1988, he hailed the transcendent possibilities of the new economy epitomized by Silicon Valley, predicting a future in which \"human innovation increasingly makes physical resources obsolete.\" Meanwhile, the market-friendly New Democrats embraced the tech industry so enthusiastically that they became known, to their chagrin, as Atari Democrats. The media turned Silicon Valley entrepreneurs into international celebrities with flattering profiles and cover stories-living proof that the mix of technological innovation, risk taking, corporate social responsibility, and lack of regulation that defined Silicon Valley in the popular imagination was the template for unending growth and prosperity, even in an era of deindustrialization and globalization.</p><p>he near-universal celebration of Silicon Valley as an avatar of free-market capitalism in the 1980s helped ensure that the market would guide the Internet's development in the 1990s, as it became the cutting-edge technology that promised to change everything. The Internet began as an academic resource, first as ARPANET, funded and overseen by the Department of Defense, and later as the National Science Foundation's NSFNET. And while Al Gore didn't invent the Internet, he did spearhead the push to privatize it: As the Clinton administration's \"technology czar,\" he helped develop its landmark National Information Infrastructure (NII) plan, which emphasized the role of private industry and the importance of telecommunications deregulation in constructing America's \"information superhighway.\" Not surprisingly, Gore would later do a little-known turn as a venture capitalist with the prestigious Valley firm Kleiner Perkins, becoming very wealthy in the process. In response to his NII plan, the advocacy group Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility warned of a possible corporate takeover of the Internet. \"An imaginative view of the risks of an NII designed without sufficient attention to public-interest needs can be found in the modern genre of dystopian fiction known as 'cyberpunk,'\" they wrote. \"Cyberpunk novelists depict a world in which a handful of multinational corporations have seized control, not only of the physical world, but of the virtual world of cyberspace.\" Who can deny that today's commercial Internet has largely fulfilled this cyberpunk nightmare? Someone should ask Gore what he thinks.</p><p>Despite offering evidence to the contrary, O'Mara narrates her tale of Silicon Valley's rise as, ultimately, a success story. At the end of the book, we see it as the envy of other states around the country and other countries around the world, an \"exuberantly capitalist, slightly anarchic tech ecosystem that had evolved over several generations.\" Throughout the book, she highlights the many issues that have sparked increasing public consternation with Big Tech of late, from its lack of diversity to its stupendous concentration of wealth, but these are framed in the end as unfortunate side effects of the headlong rush to create a new and brilliant future. She hardly mentions the revelations by the National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden of the US government's chilling capacity to siphon users' most intimate information from Silicon Valley's platforms and the voraciousness with which it has done so. Nor does she grapple with Uber, which built its multibillion-dollar leviathan on the backs of meagerly paid drivers. The fact that in order to carry out almost anything online we must subject ourselves to a hypercommodified hellscape of targeted advertising and algorithmic sorting does not appear to be a huge cause for concern. But these and many other aspects of our digital landscape have made me wonder if a technical complex born out of Cold War militarism and mainstreamed in a free-market frenzy might not be fundamentally always at odds with human flourishing. O'Mara suggests at the end of her book that Silicon Valley's flaws might be redeemed by a new, more enlightened, and more diverse generation of techies. But haven't we heard this story before?</p><p>If there is a larger lesson to learn from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code</emphasis>, it is that technology cannot be separated from the social and political contexts in which it is created. The major currents in society shape and guide the creation of a system that appears to spring from the minds of its inventors alone. Militarism and unbridled capitalism remain among the most powerful forces in the United States, and to my mind, there is no reason to believe that a new generation of techies might resist them any more effectively than the previous ones. The question of fixing Silicon Valley is inseparable from the question of fixing the system of postwar American capitalism, of which it is perhaps the purest expression. Some believe that the problems we see are bugs that might be fixed with a patch. Others think the code is so bad at its core that a radical rewrite is the only answer. Although <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code</emphasis> was written for people in the first group, it offers an important lesson for those of us in the second: Silicon Valley is as much a symptom as it is a cause of our current crisis. Resisting its bad influence on society will ultimately prove meaningless if we cannot also formulate a vision of a better world-one with a more humane relationship to technology-to counteract it. And, alas, there is no app for that.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-327129</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8G-JF81-DXR3-21X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business Development Companies</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzYyN0Y1OUJBOEFDNDA1RUJGOTgxNkJCNERFM0UwMkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEZBNjUwRkEwQjJGNDgzQzlEMzMyNEE1RDAyOTY4RkE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A4QF</classCode><className>COLD WAR</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XK2</classCode><className>APPRENTICESHIPS &amp;

Instead, it's helped Big Tech.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When Europe's tough privacy rules came into force on May 25, 2018, policymakers and industry executives expected a series of dominoes would soon start to fall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global technology giants like Facebook would feel the heat of fines of up to 4 percent of their total yearly revenue. Companies like Google would think twice before pushing ahead with aggressive new ways of collecting people's data. Smaller rivals would be given greater space to compete.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But a year later, none of those dominoes has yet fallen, according to interviews with senior policymakers, tech executives and privacy campaigners.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big fines and sweeping enforcement actions have been largely absent, as under-resourced European regulators struggle to define their mission - and take time to build investigations that will probably end up in court.</p><p>New forms of data collection, including Facebook's reintroduction of its facial recognition technology in Europe and Google's efforts to harvest information on third-party websites, have been given new leases on life under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.</p><p>Smaller firms - whose fortunes were of special concern to the framers of the region's privacy revamp - also have suffered from the relatively high compliance costs and the perception, at least among some investors, that they can't compete with Silicon Valley's biggest names.</p><p>\"Big companies like Facebook are 10 steps ahead of everyone else, and 100 steps ahead of regulators,\" declared Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a privacy expert who helped uncover Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. \"There are very big questions about what they're doing.\"</p><p>The patchy record of Europe's data protection overhaul - on the one-year anniversary of its implementation - has given industry an opportunity to blunt similar efforts outside the European Union to emulate the region's new privacy rules.</p><p>Campaigners and some lawmakers from Colombia to South Africa and even the United States clamor to import similar protections, claiming that only strict restrictions will grant citizens sufficient control over their data.</p><p>But aggressive industry lobbying in capitals worldwide has worked hard to frame Europe's laws as overly cumbersome, particularly for small companies, with technology groups warning other politicians not to merely copy Europe in the rejiggering of their own local privacy standards.</p><p>\"A lot of small and medium sized businesses are still struggling,\" said John Miller, vice president of policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group in Washington DC that represents many of Silicon Valley's biggest names. \"How do we protect the rights of consumers here without making the law quite so onerous?\"</p><p>It was not supposed to be this way.</p><p>When Europe unveiled its privacy revamp, European officials hailed it as a major victory for consumers - a message that piggybacked on the public's growing awareness of their data rights after Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which roughly 87 million of its users worldwide had their data misused during political campaigns.</p><p>Policymakers like Andrea Jelinek, an Austrian official in charge of a pan-regional group of EU data protection regulators, gave evidence to the U.S. Congress on how Europe had implemented its new laws. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, promised to offer European-style protections to all of his company's 2.2 billion global users.</p><p>But since the region's standards came into force a year ago, few companies have yet had their wings clipped by the new regulation - and some of the world's largest tech companies have used their significant in-house regulatory and financial muscle to turn Europe's privacy push to their advantage.</p><p>So far, almost 100,000 privacy complaints have been filed with national privacy regulators, though only a few have led to meaningful penalties, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals, an industry trade body. Total fines have now reached roughly (EURO)56 million - about $63 million - although almost all of that came from a one-off (EURO)50 million levy against Google by French officials (the search giant is appealing that decision).</p><p>National agencies - often small, obscure regulatory off-shoots that lack the manpower or legal resources to keep large multinationals at bay - have struggled to give Europe's privacy rules real bite, despite widespread government efforts to increase their yearly budgets. Officials urge restraint, saying that it will take time for the full force of Europe's privacy rules to take effect and that companies are already changing how they collect people's data because of potential blockbuster fines.</p><p>\"Even after 12 months, the reality is that there is no consensus or clear harmonization for how data should be processed,\" said Ahmed Baladi, co-chair of the privacy, cybersecurity and consumer protection unit at Gibson Dunn, a law firm, in Paris. \"We still need more guidance from national authorities.\"</p><p>Into this void has stepped Big Tech.</p><p>Ahead of Europe's privacy overhaul, Facebook spent months preparing to restart its facial recognition service in the region - technology that the company believes now meets the region's beefed-up standards. Ireland's data protection agency, which oversees the social media giant's activities in the EU, has yet to take a position on the matter.</p><p>Despite the previous ban, Facebook's facial recognition technology is now permitted in Europe because users are actively given the choice to opt into the service. The social networking giant also restarted the sharing of some data between WhatsApp, its popular messaging service, and Facebook - a practice that had similarly been outlawed in some states in the 28-country bloc.</p><p>Even now, some privacy regulators aren't convinced that people understand how their data may be used and that others could still have their digital information collected without consent. Facebook denies it stores data on individuals who have not chosen to use its facial recognition technology.</p><p>\"Processing of biometric data such as in automatic facial recognition comes with substantial risks,\" Johannes Caspar, head of the Hamburg privacy regulator, said in an email. \"Facial recognition must be strictly limited to those users who have opted in to that technology.\"</p><p>Google also moved quickly to cement its position in the data economy.</p><p>Weeks before Europe's new rules became law, the search giant contacted all websites, both inside the EU and elsewhere, that relied on the company's dominant advertising services, informing these publishers that they would now have to solicit people's consent to collect data on Google's behalf.</p><p>Under Europe's new privacy standards, the tech giant must get people's permission to target them with digital advertising. But by forcing publishers to do this work for Google - the search giant said if websites did not comply, they would not be able to use the company's advertising services - it added an additional line to the company's revamped privacy settings, which allowed Google to take ownership of people's data from publishers that it then could use for its own undefined purposes.</p><p>In response, the tech giant said these changes were necessary under Europe's new data protection rules, and that it had not taken greater control over data collected by publishers worldwide.</p><p>Yet in a sign of potential future privacy woes for Google, an investigation into the legality of such practices is expected to be announced in the coming weeks, according to an industry executive with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>For Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade body for publishers including The New York Times and the Guardian (Axel Springer, which co-owns the European edition of POLITICO, is also a member), Google's request represented a land grab for lucrative data that websites routinely had collected on their users - a crucial resource for newspapers increasingly going digital in search of much-needed revenues.</p><p>\"It forced our members to give Google secondary use of their data,\" said Kint. \"They're supposed to be transparent about what they're using the data for, but we don't really know.\"</p><p>The first shots in the global privacy war were fired in Europe. But as policymakers from New Delhi to Brasilia turn their attention to reining in Big Tech's use of data, the EU's standards are now at the center of cut-throat lobbying worldwide.</p><p>That's particularly true in the United States, where lawmakers and tech executives agree on the need for new privacy rules after years of Silicon Valley's dismissal of such protections.</p><p>In recent months, Congress has held multiple hearings on privacy, and politicians are engaged in negotiations over a wide-ranging data protection bill. But Republicans and Democrats are still divided on key principles, including if a federal law should override existing state-based rules and if individual consumers should have the right to sue tech firms over privacy violations.</p><p>Those sticking points may threaten to derail the push for national legislation - but the fact talks are happening after years of lack of interest can be attributed, in part, to the global influence of Europe's privacy rules.</p><p>\"There has been a dramatic change both in the attitudes toward the tech firms and, I would say, in the views of European privacy law,\" said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a campaigning group in Washington, D.C. \"Lawmakers are genuinely asking whether the U.S. needs a law similar to Europe.\"</p><p>With negotiations in Washington stalled, particularly ahead of the U.S. presidential election in 2020, attention has shifted toward U.S. states, many of which are mulling wide-ranging privacy legislation that often mirror sections of Europe's rules.</p><p>In California, which became the first U.S. state to pass wide-ranging data privacy legislation last year, lobbyists have until 2020 to soften the proposal's impact on the likes of Google and Facebook by adding industry-friendly provisions to exempt certain kinds of data collection. Companies also successfully petitioned the state's attorney general to remove the right for citizens to directly sue firms for illegally collecting their digital information.</p><p>In Washington state, lawmakers went a step further by specifically name-checking Europe's privacy standards in proposals that narrowly failed to pass the legislature in late April.</p><p>But whereas in Europe, people are automatically given the right to not have their information collected unless they give explicit consent to companies, the U.S. proposals, by default, had given businesses the right to harvest such data without needing to seek users' permission. That raised concerns among privacy groups that U.S. lawmakers were co-opting Europe's privacy reboot without offering the same fundamental rights to U.S. citizens - criticisms that the bill's backers deny.</p><p>\"GDPR is the global standard,\" said Reuven Carlyle, a Washington state senator who co-sponsored the recent privacy legislation. \"But the history of deployment of technology in the United States is more aligned to the 'opt out' approach. Without that, you fundamentally alter the value proposition of innovation.\"</p><p>This report first appeared on POLITICO.EU on May 22, 2019. </p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-067991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYR-65V1-JDJ6-K1YP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1889\"/><timeReceived>4:16 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Their politics have arguably had as disruptive an impact on the economy as their technologies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the late 1970s, Silicon Valley has grown rich, in part, because its standard-bearers envisioned a tax regime that favored capital gains over ordinary income and, with the help of conservative political allies, willed that system into being with landmark acts of federal legislation. As a member of the tech community, I am concerned about how our industry has helped destabilize the balance between democracy and capitalism, something American society took for granted during the second half of the 20th century, and catalyze today's populist backlash.</p><p>Silicon Valley's current troubles notwithstanding, technology entrepreneurs have been more accustomed to harnessing the prevailing winds than being buffeted by them. Pragmatism is the cornerstone of their political tradition. In the 1950s and early '60s, when the Department of Defense began using their transistors and microchips to give American weapons an edge in the arms race with the Soviet Union, they vigorously lobbied for military contracts while presenting themselves, shrewdly, as patriotic instruments in the Cold War struggle. They were proud to be the nouveau riche of the government funded Space Age.</p><p>Attitudes shifted in the 1960s, however, when the Department of Defense squeezed their profits by streamlining its procurement policies.

But in the post-Vietnam War and post-Watergate era, flag waving would have been tone-deaf; they needed new ways to make their agenda resonate. So, Silicon Valley's political activists-venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and corporate executives by day-adopted the populist language of the \"tax revolt,\" which was then gathering momentum around the country as conservative journalists like Jude Wanniski, and economists including Milton Friedman and Arthur Laffer, called for rolling back taxes and regulation to \"free\" the markets.</p><p>They astutely framed their proposed legislation as a job-creation initiative and a stimulus for small businesses. And in Edwin Zschau, the charismatic young president of a computer-peripherals firm with a business-management PhD and a self-effacing sense of humor, they found a spokesman who could present himself both as a knowledgeable authority on technology entrepreneurship and, crucially, as an heir to the American tradition of small-business populism.</p><p>As a chairman of the American Electronics Association, the industry's trade organization, Zschau commissioned a study linking the availability of venture capital and job growth. Young firms dependent on equity financing were shown to create new positions faster than mature ones, in addition to generating other benefits for the economy like improved productivity and more exports. Cutting the capital-gains tax, then, could be sold as an investment in the American people.</p><p>With their local congressman's guidance, Zschau and his associates persuaded William Steiger, a moderate Republican congressman from Wisconsin, to introduce their legislation. This was national news: A sympathetic op-ed in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Wall Street Journal</emphasis>, for example, claimed that their initiative was \"not one tax provision among many, but the cutting edge of an important intellectual and financial breakthrough.\" \"Stupendous Steiger,\" the paper exclaimed.</p><p>President Carter opposed the bill, but Zschau and his allies outmaneuvered the administration by forging alliances with other supply-side-advocacy groups, launching a national lobbying campaign and, over the course of multiple trips to Capitol Hill, systematically recruiting Democrats, who controlled both the House and Senate. Zschau even circulated a recording of himself playing a self-composed, folksy song called \"The Old Risk Capital Blues.\"</p><p>Their efforts paid off. In the summer of 1978, Congress passed the Revenue Act reducing the capital-gains tax to 28 percent, a remarkable victory that earned Zschau a local \"Business Leader of the Year\" award. Three years later, they helped usher in the Economic Recovery Tax Act, also known as the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut, which reduced the capital gains tax to 20 percent and reinstated lower rates for stock options.</p><p>By then, of course, the low-tax ideology was no longer iconoclastic. The election of Ronald Reagan, who garnered 60,000 more votes in Santa Clara County than President Carter, confirmed that the gospel of technology entrepreneurship as a force for shared prosperity matched the new neoliberal era as well as patriotic anti-communism had matched the height of the Cold War.</p><p>Reagan regularly romanticized Silicon Valley, even telling young people to \"follow in the footsteps of those two college students [Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak] who launched one of America's great computer firms [Apple] from the garage behind their house.... You, too, can become leaders in this great new era of progress-the age of the entrepreneur.\"</p><p>Today, of course, it is much harder to claim that lowering the capital-gains tax reduces inequality by \"spreading the base of ownership,\" or that lowering the rate on stock options is \"vital to the maintenance of the competitive position of small companies versus large companies.\" Whatever the benefits of those policies, the proliferation of billionaire brogrammers and the rise of Big Tech confirm that more economic equality and greater competitiveness between firms are probably not among them.</p><p>It is no small irony that framing entrepreneurship as an engine of inclusive growth helped concentrate more economic power in the hands of fewer people; that's just how powerful the mythologies of Silicon Valley have been. Armed today with an understanding of how they pulled it off, activists and reformers should write new stories that promote, rather than undermine, a more equitable balance between economic individualism and inclusiveness. They need the right narrative for the moment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-294416</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYJ-BBD1-DXR3-212D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1301\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 15, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Ad Policy[3] Indeed, contrary to the popular perception of technology entrepreneurs as obsessive tinkerers above the fray (at least, until they are called to testify before Congress), they have been politically active since the earliest days of the microelectronics industry. Their politics have arguably had as disruptive an impact on the economy as their technologies. Since the late 1970s, Silicon Valley has grown rich, in part, because its standard-bearers envisioned a tax regime that favored capital gains over ordinary income and, with the help of conservative political allies, willed that system into being with landmark acts of federal legislation. As a member of the tech community, I am concerned about how our industry has helped destabilize the balance between democracy and capitalism, something American society took for granted during the second half of the 20th century, and catalyze today's populist backlash. Silicon Valley's current troubles notwithstanding, technology entrepreneurs have been more accustomed to harnessing the prevailing winds than being buffeted by them. Pragmatism is the cornerstone of their political tradition. In the 1950s and early '60s, when the Department of Defense began using their transistors and microchips to give American weapons an edge in the arms race with the Soviet Union, they vigorously lobbied for military contracts while presenting themselves, shrewdly, as patriotic instruments in the Cold War struggle. They were proud to be the nouveau riche of the government funded Space Age. Attitudes shifted in the 1960s, however, when the Department of Defense squeezed their profits by streamlining its procurement policies. Silicon Valley dubbed this episode the 'McNamara Depression,' a pejorative reference to then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and scrambled to find civilian applications for their technologies in order to wean themselves off their dependence on government spending. Over the next decade, they encountered the state less as a consumer and more as a regulator: They resisted the government's prohibition on the sale of commercial microelectronics, some of which had dual-use military applications, to Eastern Bloc countries; lobbied against plans to cancel a tax exemption that allowed them to export components to low-wage countries for assembly and then import them back to the United States on a tax-free basis; and advocated for an exemption to fuel rationing during the Arab oil embargo. When Congress increased the capital-gains tax, making it less lucrative for entrepreneurs to 'exit' their companies by selling stock, they mobilized to reduce that tax and reclassify profits from stock options\u2014cash-strapped entrepreneurs used them to recruit workers\u2014as capital gains, rather than ordinary income. Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/november-5-2018-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/november-5-2018-issue/</url> Patriotism had been the lingua franca of government contracting during the height of the Cold War. But in the post-Vietnam War and post-Watergate era, flag waving would have been tone-deaf; they needed new ways to make their agenda resonate. So, Silicon Valley's political activists\u2014venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and corporate executives by day\u2014adopted the populist language of the 'tax revolt,' which was then gathering momentum around the country as conservative journalists like Jude Wanniski, and economists including Milton Friedman and Arthur Laffer, called for rolling back taxes and regulation to 'free' the markets. They astutely framed their proposed legislation as a job-creation initiative and a stimulus for small businesses. And in Edwin Zschau, the charismatic young president of a computer-peripherals firm with a business-management PhD and a self-effacing sense of humor, they found a spokesman who could present himself both as a knowledgeable authority on technology entrepreneurship and, crucially, as an heir to the American tradition of small-business populism. As a chairman of the American Electronics Association, the industry's trade organization, Zschau commissioned a study linking the availability of venture capital and job growth. Young firms dependent on equity financing were shown to create new positions faster than mature ones, in addition to generating other benefits for the economy like improved productivity and more exports. Cutting the capital-gains tax, then, could be sold as an investment in the American people. With their local congressman's guidance, Zschau and his associates persuaded William Steiger, a moderate Republican congressman from Wisconsin, to introduce their legislation. This was national news: A sympathetic op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, for example, claimed that their initiative was 'not one tax provision among many, but the cutting edge of an important intellectual and financial breakthrough.' 'Stupendous Steiger,' the paper exclaimed. President Carter opposed the bill, but Zschau and his allies outmaneuvered the administration by forging alliances with other supply-side-advocacy groups, launching a national lobbying campaign and, over the course of multiple trips to Capitol Hill, systematically recruiting Democrats, who controlled both the House and Senate. Zschau even circulated a recording of himself playing a self-composed, folksy song called 'The Old Risk Capital Blues.' Their efforts paid off. In the summer of 1978, Congress passed the Revenue Act reducing the capital-gains tax to 28 percent, a remarkable victory that earned Zschau a local 'Business Leader of the Year' award. Three years later, they helped usher in the Economic Recovery Tax Act, also known as the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut, which reduced the capital gains tax to 20 percent and reinstated lower rates for stock options.By then, of course, the low-tax ideology was no longer iconoclastic. The election of Ronald Reagan, who garnered 60,000 more votes in Santa Clara County than President Carter, confirmed that the gospel of technology entrepreneurship as a force for shared prosperity matched the new neoliberal era as well as patriotic anti-communism had matched the height of the Cold War. Reagan regularly romanticized Silicon Valley, even telling young people to 'follow in the footsteps of those two college students [Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak] who launched one of America's great computer firms [Apple] from the garage behind their house. You, too, can become leaders in this great new era of progress\u2014the age of the entrepreneur.' Today, of course, it is much harder to claim that lowering the capital-gains tax reduces inequality by 'spreading the base of ownership,' or that lowering the rate on stock options is 'vital to the maintenance of the competitive position of small companies versus large companies.' Whatever the benefits of those policies, the proliferation of billionaire brogrammers and the rise of Big Tech confirm that more economic equality and greater competitiveness between firms are probably not among them. It is no small irony that framing entrepreneurship as an engine of inclusive growth helped concentrate more economic power in the hands of fewer people; that's just how powerful the mythologies of Silicon Valley have been. Armed today with an understanding of how they pulled it off, activists and reformers should write new stories that promote, rather than undermine, a more equitable balance between economic individualism and inclusiveness. They need the right narrative for the moment.

So do I. Once upon a time, Silicon Valley was the jewel in the American crown, a magnet for high IQ - and predominately male - talent from all over the world. Palo Alto was the centre of what its more delusional inhabitants regarded as the Florence of Renaissance 2.0. Parents swelled with pride when their offspring landed a job with the Googles, Facebooks and Apples of that world, where they stood a sporting chance of becoming as rich as they might have done if they had joined Goldman Sachs or Lehman Brothers, but without the moral odium attendant on investment backing. I mean to say, where else could you be employed by a company to which every president, prime minister and aspirant politician craved an invitation? Where else could you be part of inventing the future?</p><p>But that was then and this is now. It's taken an unconscionable length of time, but the tide of approbation has turned. Tech has suddenly lost its halo. Everywhere one looks, we find groups sharpening knives for a critique or an attack on big tech. In an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/how-politicians-and-scholars-turned-against-big-tech/591052/\">interesting essay</url> in the Atlantic, for example, the commentator Alexis Madrigal identifies no fewer than 15 different groups preparing ambushes. They include angry conservatives and progressive politicians, disillusioned tech luminaries, competition lawyers, privacy advocates, European regulators, mainstream media, scholarly critics, other corporations (telecoms firms, for example, plus Oracle and other business-software companies, for example), consumer-protection organisations and, last but not least, Chinese internet companies. With enemies like these, the US tech companies are suddenly discovering that they really need some friends.</p><p>Since the tech guys think they embody the future, they have little use for history. Which is a shame, since it may have some lessons for them. \"There was a time,\" writes <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/how-politicians-and-scholars-turned-against-big-tech/591052/\">Madrigal</url>, for example, \"when Americans loved and talked about the transcontinental railroads the way we loved and talked about the internet.\" The steel lines spanning the continental United States were once \"the epitome of modernity\", as the historian Richard White put it in his book,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/how-politicians-and-scholars-turned-against-big-tech/591052/\">Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America</url>. But then things changed: the public turned on the railroads. \"The innovations entrepreneurs brought to the railroads - financial mechanisms, pricing innovations and political techniques - were as harmful to the public, to the republic, and even to the corporation as they were profitable to many of the innovators.\"</p><p>They were cool, young, idealist, smart and never, ever wore suits</p><p>Something like this lies ahead for the titans of Silicon Valley. The forces driving public disillusionment with their companies are many and varied. They include the sociopathic failure of some of the founders of these outfits to appreciate the consequences of their deployment of digital technology. Exhibit A in this regard is the Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, but there are many other of his ilk among his peers in Silicon Valley. Then there's the fact that the future that tech giants aspire to bring about no longer looks so attractive to ordinary citizens, who see their communities, jobs, societies and politics being screwed by tech giants.</p><p>The companies themselves are engines of inequality, enriching tiny elites while laying waste to whole swaths of our economies. The unscrupulous ethos of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/how-politicians-and-scholars-turned-against-big-tech/591052/\">surveillance capitalism</url> that some of them practise now looks as distasteful as the financial capitalism that brought about the banking catastrophe of 2008. And we are beginning to realise that the immense power that the valley's uber-geeks have acquired is what Stanley Baldwin memorably nailed as \"power without responsibility - the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages\".</p><p>With hindsight, the most intriguing question is why these companies were given such a free ride for so long. One major reason is that the areas in which they most aggressively innovated were lawless, in the sense that at the time there was no applicable law that might have hindered them. So their prevailing mindset that \"it's easier to ask forgiveness than to seek permission\" was allowed to run amok. Another is that governments were so dazzled by the technology - and so paralysed by neoliberal notions of the alleged inadequacy of the state - that they just let the creative destruction rip. But the biggest problem of all was that we collectively took tech companies at their own valuation. The people who founded these outfits all maintained that they were not like the evil capitalists of old. They were cool, young, idealistic, smart and never, ever wore suits. They supported the Democrats and had mantras such as \"don't be evil\" in their filings to regulators. What we omitted to notice was that the companies they founded were just corporations. And once they went public they did what corporations do: maximise shareholder value, come what may, avoid regulation and pay as little tax as possible.
