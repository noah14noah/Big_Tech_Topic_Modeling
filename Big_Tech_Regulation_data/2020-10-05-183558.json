Fourteen attorneys general, also representing Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, are attempting to stop the merger. With approvals already secured from federal regulators, the trial is believed to be the last major regulatory or legal hurdle for the deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to a scheduling order by the court, the parties have committed to a two-week trial, with defendants having the right to seek a third week. The trial will begin on Dec. 9 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>In a Dec. 2 note to investors, New Street Research Policy Adviser Blair Levin said while New Street views the odds of the trial to be close, the \"states are more likely than not to win.\"</p><p>Levin added that this is due to \"weaknesses we see in the companies market definition, reliance on economic arguments with little support in antitrust precedent, a zig-zag approach to the DOJ and FCC's judgments, a reliance on behavioral remedies to justify the fix and a reliance on public interest considerations, such as social or industrial policy, that generally are considered irrelevant to competition analysis.\"</p><p>But Levin noted that New Street \"could see the Judge accepting a number of arguments from the companies and ultimately ruling their way, including by fashioning his own remedies.\"</p><p>Speaking on T-Mobile's third-quarter earnings call in October, T-Mobile CEO John Legere said he expects the deal will close in early 2020 after the lawsuit is resolved.</p><p>In November, the company announced that T-Mobile President and COO Mike Sievert will succeed Legere as CEO in May 2020. Legere said in a statement announcing the move that in the months ahead, his goal is to focus on \"ensuring a smooth leadership transition and continuing to work closely with the Board and Mike to complete the Sprint transaction.\"</p><p>Government</p><p>Dec. 9 A state-led challenge to the T-Mobile/Sprint merger begins in federal district court in New York.

The hearing will examine the commission's ongoing series of hearings looking at the landscape of competition and consumer protection law and policy, and consider whether the FTC should be granted expanded authority on privacy and data security matters. It will also look at how changes in technology have impacted the agency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and all four FTC commissioners are expected to attend and testify.</p><p>The agency's series of hearings was launched under the leadership of Simons, who has said that the \"self-examination\" from the commission is an effort to make sure its enforcement and policy work keeps pace with changes in the economy. So far, the commission has held seven hearings for its hearings initiative, with three more scheduled through February 2019. Two of the three remaining hearings are committed to the topics of data security and consumer privacy.</p><p>The issues of antitrust and privacy have also been popular topics in Congress over the past year after a series of privacy incidents were uncovered at high-profile social media outlets such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC. Since Facebook s data privacy breaches came to light earlier this year, both the House and Senate have held multiple hearings on privacy issues. A number of different privacy policy proposals have been introduced in the current Congress for consideration.</p><p>One such proposal was co-led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who serves as ranking member on the subcommittee conducting the FTC oversight hearing this week. If enacted, the bill would direct the FTC to establish privacy protections for edge provider customers.</p><p>The commission announced earlier this year that it was investigating whether Facebook's data breach disclosures constituted a violation of a 2011 consent order with the agency to improve transparency of privacy practices. If the agency finds Facebook in violation of this order, it could spur hefty fines against the social media giant.</p><p>The FTC is also facing pressure to act against Google. After the company announced in October that it would be shutting down its Google+ social network after disclosing that it had mistakenly shared the data of hundreds of thousands of its users, Blumenthal sent a letter to the FTC asking for an investigation into the companies privacy practices.

Michael Kratsios, the United States' chief technology officer, will also testify.</p><p>One way in which the FCC has attempted to help make 5G a reality for more consumers is through making more spectrum available for the technology. In November 2019, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced a proposal to make 280 MHz of C-band spectrum available in a public auction for use in 5G mobile broadband.</p><p>The 3.7 GHz to 4.2 GHz band spectrum, commonly referred to as the C-band, is allocated in the U.S. for fixed-satellite service or space-to-Earth transmissions. C-band is considered key for rolling out 5G services.</p><p>5G mobility service promises to provide increased bandwidth and more opportunities for connectivity, enabling the new era of the internet of things where billions of devices in homes and across cities will be connected at all times. When fully implemented, 5G will offer download speeds many times faster than 4G LTE networks and significantly lower latency times. Latency is the amount of time it takes to send a message from the device to the network and get a response.</p><p>The agency has said an auction will commence before the end of 2020.</p><p>Last month, the agency also announced plans to launch a 5G fund for rural America, which would make up to $9 billion in Universal Service Fund money available to carriers for 5G mobile wireless service deployment. The USF provides subsidies to connect unserved and rural areas with telecommunications services.</p><p>Kratsios' responsibilities at the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy include encouraging the development of new and emerging technologies.

Meanwhile, a coalition of state attorneys general is scheduled to appear in court for a preliminary hearing in an effort to block the deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A federal decision</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice could conditionally approve the transaction as early as this week, more than a year after the merger was announced, according to reports from The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and other major media outlets. The DOJ is reportedly urging Sprint and T-Mobile to sell multiple assets to create a new wireless competitor as a condition for the approval.</p><p>Sprint and T-Mobile previously committed to divesting Sprint's prepaid Boost Mobile brand as the companies sought approval for the merger from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The DOJ wants the combined entity to go further, selling some of its wireless spectrum to help preserve a strong fourth player in the U.S. wireless industry, according to reports.</p><p>Satellite communications provider Dish Network Corp. is considered the front runner to acquire any divested assets, according to the Journal. Other bidders reportedly include cable operators Charter Communications Inc. and Altice USA Inc.DISH has spent $21 billion on spectrum purchases over the past decade, and the company is building out a narrowband network, known as an NB-IoT network, specialized for the low-power machine-to-machine communications that characterize the internet of things. DISH must have the network in operation by March 2020 in order to meet an FCC deadline.</p><p>The NB-IoT network is expected to be just the first phase of development. Under the second phase of the project, DISH plans to spend as much as $10 billion to build out a full next-generation 5G wireless network.</p><p>A state-level challenge</p><p>At the state level, Judge Victor Marrero of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has set a June 21 pre-trial hearing date for the lawsuit brought by state attorneys general to try and block the Sprint-T-Mobile deal.</p><p>The complaint, filed in New York federal court on June 11, alleges that the merger of two of the four largest national mobile network operators would reduce competition and drive up prices for wireless services, ultimately harming consumers. Among the states objecting to the deal are New York, California, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, Virginia and Wisconsin, as well as the District of Columbia.</p><p>The complaint specifically notes that the combined entity would be the largest U.S. provider of prepaid mobile services both directly and indirectly through arrangements with mobile virtual network operators. Prepaid offerings, which consumers pay for in advance of use, are frequently used by low-income populations because these services do not require a credit check.</p><p>The June 21 hearing comes after the state attorneys general requested \"a reasonably expeditious case schedule\" from the court. The pre-trial hearing is expected to address \"scheduling and other case-management issues,\" according to the request.</p><p>Federal government June 17 The FCC's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau will host a webinar to discuss available resources and best practices for small and rural communications providers regarding network reliability and security.

The hearing is titled, \"Oversight of the Enforcement of the Antitrust Laws.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing was originally scheduled for July 23, but was postponed. Later that week, on July 26, DOJ conditionally approved T-Mobile US Inc.'s pending merger with Sprint Corp.</p><p>Both agencies have been active in their scrutiny of large tech platforms in recent months.</p><p>The FTC announced in February that it had formed a task force to monitor competition in U.S. technology markets.</p><p>In July, Facebook Inc. disclosed that it was being investigated by the FTC for antitrust concerns, shortly after it agreed to pay a $5 billion fine to settle FTC-documented privacy violations.</p><p>Additionally, the FTC has started interviewing sellers on Amazon.com Inc.'s platform as part of an investigation into the e-commerce giant's power over competition, Bloomberg News reported Sept. 11. Simons has reportedly said he is prepared to break up large technology platforms if necessary.</p><p>In July, the DOJ announced an antitrust review into \"whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>Earlier this summer, multiple media reports alleged that the two agencies collaborated to split antitrust jurisdiction of specific companies, with the FTC being tasked to take the lead on antitrust investigations into Facebook and Amazon and the DOJ taking the lead on antitrust probes into Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC.</p><p>While an antitrust investigation into Google announced Sept. 9 by 50 attorneys general is independent of federal probes, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said it is \"possible\" that the coalition of attorneys general could share information with the DOJ and that the group has discussed antitrust issues related to tech companies with Delrahim.</p><p>Scrutiny toward large tech platforms from lawmakers has been a rare bipartisan issue in recent years.</p><p>Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who launched an antitrust investigation into Google when he was attorney general of Missouri, said he was \"heartened\" by the news of the state-led probe. Hawley has also reportedly said that Congress should have a discussion \"about what antitrust looks like when applied to the tech world.\"</p><p>In 2018, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said big tech \"maybe is no longer entitled to be as big as it is.\"</p><p>In addition to Senate oversight of antitrust enforcement, the House Judiciary Committee is also actively engaged in a bipartisan probe of competition in digital markets.</p><p>Officials from Facebook, Twitter Inc. and Google will also be testifying before the Senate this week. On Sept. 18, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation will hold a hearing titled, \"Mass Violence, Extremism, and Digital Responsibility.\"</p><p>According to a committee announcement, the hearing will \"examine the proliferation of extremism online and explore the effectiveness of industry efforts to remove violent content from online platforms.\" Monika Bickert, head of global policy management at Facebook; Nick Pickles, public policy director at Twitter; and Derek Slater, global director of information policy at Google, are all expected to testify.</p><p>Government</p><p>Sept. 17 A Senate Committee on the Judiciary subcommittee will host a hearing titled \"Oversight of the Enforcement of the Antitrust Laws.\" Sept. 18 The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation will host a hearing titled \"Mass Violence, Extremism, and Digital Responsibility.\" Sept. 18 The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology will host a hearing titled \"The Next Mile: Technology Pathways to Accelerate Sustainability Within the Transportation Sector.\"</p><p>Industry, legal and think tank events Sept. 16 The Professional Services Council will host an event titled \"2019 Tech Trends Conference\" in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Sept. 16-18 The Competitive Carriers Association, an advocacy group for rural, regional and nationwide wireless telecommunications providers, will host its annual convention in Providence, R.I.</p><p>Sept. 17 America's Communications Association will host a regional meeting with the National Cable Television Cooperative in Providence, R.I.</p><p>Sept. 17-18 The National Association for Multi-ethnicity in Communications will host an event titled \"2019 NAMIC Conference\" in New York.</p><p>Sept. 19 The Washington International Trade Association will host an event titled \"YTP x YCW DC: Rare Earths, 5G, and How the US Should Respond to Chinese Tech s Rising Global Influence\" in Washington, D.C.

The committee on July 22 postponed the hearing, titled \"Oversight of the Enforcement of the Antitrust Laws,\" and did not announce a new date for the event. Representatives from the committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing had been planned to coincide with a week in which the telecom industry is expecting a DOJ decision on the pending merger between Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. Published reports have indicated the T-Mobile and Sprint are working with the DOJ to craft a deal with DISH Network Corp. under which the satellite operator would acquire divested assets from the carriers. CNBC and Reuters have each cited anonymous sources as saying the DOJ has given the companies until the end of this week to wrap up their negotiations or risk facing an antitrust lawsuit blocking the larger combination.</p><p>Under Delrahim's leadership, DOJ has not hesitated to contest a merger it considers to be anticompetitive. For example, DOJ challenged AT&amp;T Inc.'s acquisition of Warner Media LLC, a legal gambit that the department ultimately lost.</p><p>In other legislative business, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation will hold a July 24 markup on a series of measures that include 5G implementation and broadband deployment.</p><p>One bipartisan bill the subcommittee is set to consider is the United States 5G Leadership Act of 2019, which would promote 5G service deployment and information sharing with U.S. communications providers regarding network security risks. Another 5G item on the slate is a bipartisan bill known as the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2019, which would compel the president to develop a security strategy for next-generation telecommunications systems and infrastructure and to assist allies in maximizing their own 5G infrastructure, systems and software security.</p><p>Also on the agenda for consideration is a bipartisan bill known as the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act that would direct the FCC to issue data collection rules regarding broadband service availability.</p><p>Federal government</p><p>July 22 White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to meet with various tech executives to discuss the American ban on sales to Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. July 24 The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation will hold a markup session where it will consider a series of legislative measures regarding 5G implementation and broadband deployment.

According to a New York Times article last week, Google earned $4.7 billion from the work of news publishers in 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The company's created a heck of a business model, swelling its own coffers by delivering content produced, at great effort and expense, by others. It's hard to imagine a brick and mortar business-model equivalent that would be considered above board.</p><p> The numbers quoted in the Times are from a study by News Media Alliance (NMA), a group that represents more than 2,000 media organizations. Believe it or not, $4.7 billion is considered a conservative estimate \u2014 it doesn't take into account the value of personal data Google collects from people clicking their way through all those news stories.</p><p> As NMA President and Chief Executive David Chavern told the Times, \"They make money off this arrangement \u2026 and there needs to be a better outcome for news publishers.\"</p><p>Congress is mulling legislation that would grant news companies an antitrust exemption for a specified period of time. That would allow them to join forces in negotiating better deals for their content.</p><p> It's rare to find agreement in Congress, but every so often it happens. The proposal enjoys bipartisan support as Republicans and Democrats alike recognize the value of news publishers and understand the devastating impact big tech's practices have had on traditional media.</p><p> There also seems to be a dawning realization that only something as drastic as implementation of the nation's antitrust laws can have any real impact on companies as large and dominant as the tech giants. There's perhaps some foreshadowing there.</p><p> The long-term survival of what most of us consider news is part and parcel of a larger conversation about how and to what degree lawmakers should address the power and influence of these technology companies. Some have suggested breaking them up.</p><p> On one hand it feels almost surreal that regulations conceived in the 1800s to break up steel, rail and oil monopolies are what Congress has at its disposal \u2014 like contemplating a cavalry charge on a modern battlefield.</p><p> On the other hand \u2026 if we're indeed seeing history repeat itself, perhaps the old ways are best.</p><p> We needed (and need) rail, oil, steel \u2014 all the industries that grew into trusts that were busted by the government rose to that level, due in large part to the country's demand for them. But they grew large enough, dominant enough that their power over swaths of the economy was harmful.</p><p> In 2019, we're way past anyone suggesting we don't need the many innovations that have come about by way of big tech's efforts. But have we, in exchange for that, allowed them to achieve a dominance \u2014 and operate with an impunity \u2014 that's dangerous?</p><p> In terms of the news industry, specifically, providing news publishers better footing \u2014 from which to negotiate compensation for their product \u2014 makes sense. Exploring the antitrust exemption that's been proposed is a good start.</p><p> By and large, those publishers are media outlets struggling to adjust and survive as their revenue is drained away.</p><p> While few stop to think about all that goes into producing news, most people do consume news publishers' content in one form or another, which gives almost everyone an interest in preventing traditional media from slowly being bled dry.</p><p> That includes Google and other tech giants. And they're smart people \u2014 they can figure out a way to make a killing without killing news.</p><p> \u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p> John Dilmore is editor of the Roswell Daily Record.

(Meg James,Los Angeles Times[1]). The newly merged company was listed on the Nasdaq on December 5, 2019 under the tickers 'VIACA' as the Class A stock and 'VIAC' as the Class B stock. </p><p>(Staff,Business Wire[2]). CBS and Viacom are two mass media companies that create and distribute content across a variety of platforms in almost every field of media and entertainment. Id. In previous years, the two companies have merged twice with their most recent merge occurring in 1999, lasting until 2006 where Sumner Redstone split the merged entity. (Jonathan Barr,Forbes[3]). This history makes the two media giants no strangers to federal regulatory authorities, and the merger follows the lead of other major players in the entertainment industry ('Big Media').The Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') regulates sales and transfers of securities, and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice ('DOJ') and the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') police anti-competition matters. (Ann Beth Stebbins and Thomas Kennedy,International Comparative Legal Guides[4]). Prospective mergers are often assessed on the potential for negative consequences that would result from a union of two companies, but a vast majority of aspiring mergers are approved by the FTC despite the potential for anti-competitive issues. ('Mergers',Federal Trade Commission[5]). Since mergers between two large companies often present antitrust issues, the transactions are governed by the Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Clayton Act. ('Antitrust Laws',Federal Trade Commission[6]). Applicable here, Section 7 of the Clayton Act ('Act') prohibits mergers and acquisitions when the effect 'may be substantially to lessen competition[] or tend to create a monopoly.' ('Mergers',Federal Trade Commission[7]). The FTC and DOJ'sHorizontal Merger Guidelinesset out an analytical framework that determines if a horizontal merger\u2014a proposed merger between direct competitors\u2014will fall inside the Act's prohibitive standard. Id.The ViacomCBS Merger comes in the wake of a number of Big Media mergers, creating direct competition between the mega-companies for snagging market share in the streaming space. (Peter Csathy,Forbes[8]). Specifically, other conglomerates who merged in 2019 include AT...ith Time Warner, Disney with Fox, and ComcastNBC Universal with Sky. Id. At the same time, Big Tech companies - namely Apple, Amazon, Google, and Verizon - have their sights set on acquiring media companies in 2020 to enhance their reach to consumers, opening up antitrust questions in their own right. Id. Therefore, to keep up with the competition, ViacomCBS' next strategic move will likely be to acquire other smaller media companies in an effort to expand their reach and increase content subscribers. (Peter Kafka,Vox[9]). ViacomCBS wasted no time in doing so as they agreed to acquire a 49% stake in Miramax, an entertainment company involved in producing TV shows and movies, for $375 million just two weeks after the merger. (Billy Duberstein,The Motley Fool[10]).ViacomCBS may also look to other partnership opportunities with the remaining majority owner, BeIN Group,in an effort to expand beyond traditional television outlets. Id. However, despite ViacomCBS' merger and subsequent growth from their acquisition of PlutoTV and investment in Miramax, analyst Richard Greenfield of LightShed Partners predicts that 9% of ViacomCBS' jobs could be at stake. (Paul Bond,Hollywood Reporter[11]). According to the most recent filings before the merger, Viacom had 10,400 full-time employees while CBS had 12,770 full-time employees. Id. Greenfield estimates that roughly 2,000 of those jobs could be lost due to corporate synergy. Id. Nonetheless, with ViacomCBS joining the arena of Big Media mergers, their role in the space will be something to watch in 2020 as they remain a key player among media conglomerates commanding the highest proportion of U.S. TV audience at 22%.

It's a sign of things to come, as the Epic Games Store and fellow upstart Discord both challenge Steam's dominance, in a battle that could have ramifications for the entire app store economy. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Google, and Electronic Arts are working on game streaming, something that could undermine the very notion of a dedicated video games console. And Microsoft is pushing Xbox Game Pass, a $10/month service that has the potential to change the economics of the video game business \u2014 threading a needle between free-to-play and traditional game purchases. </p><p>Ultimately, all of this adds up to one key takeaway: In the video game industry, no incumbent is safe, and everything seems increasingly up for grabs. Far and away, the biggest video game of the year was \"Fortnite,\" which has become a major piece of mainstream pop culture \u2014 and a revenue-generating juggernaut \u2014 in its own right. An underrated aspect of the \"Fortnite\" phenomenon, however, is all the ways in which its developer, Epic Games, has been using its success as a lever to subtly but firmly shift the power dynamics of the video game industry. When Epic decided to skip Google Play, and offer \"Fortnite\" directly to Android users, it was sending a clear message about what it thinks of the fact that Google takes 30% of every transaction[5] \u2014 a model that's been the standard for every platform, more or less, since Apple first launched the App Store in 2009. And Epic is apparently living its principles, too: Just recently, it launched the Epic Games Store[6], a PC storefront that offers developers a full 90% of their revenues. Discord, a popular gaming voice chat service, also joined this push with a similar model[7], ultimately putting pressure on leading PC games store Steam to change its revenue split[8], too. All of this is happening against the backdrop of a major R...ush at the big tech companies to totally shake up the dynamics of the video game industry from the bottom up. This year, Google's Project Stream[9], currently in beta testing, aims to bring console-quality games to any phone or computer via the web browser; Microsoft has its own Project xCloud[10], with similar aims. Mega-published Electronic Arts has its own streaming ambitions[11], too. Read more: Google's new video-game streaming service could mark the beginning of the end for gaming consoles[12]Speaking of Microsoft, this year it doubled down on Xbox Game Pass[13], an all-you-can-eat buffet of Xbox games for $10 a month. The idea, Microsoft's Phil Spencer told Business Insider this year[14], is to build towards a new business model for video games, threading the needle between free-to-play titles like \"Fortnite\" and the traditional $50-$60 price tag for a new game. Individually, these are interesting developments. Taken all together, it paints an astonishing picture: Literally, every facet of the video game business is facing upheaval. And every single incumbent platform, from the digital game storefronts all the way down to the humble video game console itself, suddenly seems way more vulnerable than it did even a year ago.Store warsSteam, originally launched in 2003, is the most popular PC games store on the planet, and likely the biggest single digital games store, period. The success of steam has made proprietor Valve Software, best known as the developer of the \"Half-Life\" series and esports smash \"Dota2,\" arguably the single most important company in the business. Recently, though, Steam has come under scrutiny. Last year, Steam was criticized for having perhapstoomuch power[15] in the industry, achieving something that critics declared something close to a monopoly \u2014 essentially locking developers into whatever revenue split it cared to offer. Earlier this year, Steam courted controversy, as well, after a game casting players as a school shooter was approved for sale on its digital storefront[16]. In the wake of the uproar, Valve actually took an unexpectedly drastic measure: It decided that it would open the floodgates and allow literally any game to be sold on Steam, unless it contained illegal content or, in its words, was \"straight up trolling.\" Critics took it as an abdication of responsibility for the platform. Read more: The world's largest gaming service, Steam, is giving up on regulation and turning over 200 million users into guinea pigs[17]All of this just added fuel to the fire of a debate that has been ongoing in Silicon Valley and beyond for a while: Why, some have asked, should developers accept that the major stores \u2014 including Apple's and Google's \u2014 take a 30% cut, when it doesn't always seem like those same stores have developers' best interests at heart? Read more: The uproar over how 'Fortnite' is being released for Android shows how much we have acquiesced to Apple's way of doing business[18] So it's no surprise that Epic Games, flush with investment capital[19], and fresh from the success of \"Fortnite,\" decided that the time was right to strike at Steam, even as it dissed Google on Android. For its part, Discord, recently valued at over $2 billion[20], had seen massive success in developing a voice-and-text chat service that lots of gamers liked better than Steam's built-in tools, giving the startup its own leverage into the games market. To be sure, both companies have their work cut out for them: Attracting developers away from the mighty Steam is going to be no small task, tantamount to asking them to cut out their most proven audiences. Still, those more favorable terms of business is already proving attractive, as Epic especially has locked in several exclusive titles, like the anticipated \"Hades\" from Supergiant Games[21]. If these upstart gaming stores find success with giving developers a bigger piece of the pie, you can be certain that you'll be hearing a much more public airing of grievances about Apple, Google, and anybody else who takes a big cut of store revenues. And more directly, Steam, which once seemed like it had a perpetual stranglehold on the PC gaming industry, suddenly looks very vulnerable, indeed.The video game console is vulnerable, tooThe dedicated video game console has been a mainstay of the industry for decades. While the business is definitely cyclical, it's weathered would-be crises \u2014 like the advent of the smartphone boom \u2014 and kept on trucking. Now, Sony and Microsoft are working on the next generations of PlayStation and Xbox, respectively. But the stars are aligning to, perhaps, make this the last generation of traditional video game consoles. The surest signs yet come from Google and Microsoft, which are both gearing up to offer their own cloud-based gaming services. Essentially, these services would do the hard work of actually rendering the game in their own, massively powerful data centers. Then, the video gets streamed to your device. When you move the controller, the signal goes back up to the cloud, starting the cycle over.This has several implications. First off, it means that any device, regardless of computing horsepower, can theoretically run any game \u2014 after all, it's Google's or Microsoft's cloud that needs to have the cutting-edge graphics hardware, not your phone, tablet, or computer. Google has been testing it with the graphics-rich \"Assassin's Creed Odyssey[22],\" and by all accounts, it works a treat. Just open a Google Chrome browser window and get playing. All of which implies that future blockbuster-quality video games could be playable from your phone, on the go, anywhere. It's been tried before, sure \u2014 notably the failed OnLive service and Sony's own PlayStation Now[23] \u2014 but the incoming rise of ultra-speed 5G wireless internet could make it more feasible, even as \"Fortnite\" proves that more people, especially the younger crowd, will embrace the smartphone as a gaming platform...for the right game. And while the video game console might stick around, it could mutate: A console would no longer need to pack a ton of computing horsepower into a package that costs hundreds of dollars; it could theoretically be a smaller, cheaper package that mostly exists to provide a link to the cloud. Again, this has been tried before to little effect, notably with the Sony PlayStation TV, but times have changed and the market has evolved. Finally, this brings us back to Microsoft and the Xbox Game Pass. It's not hard to imagine a world where the Project xCloud gaming cloud service and the Xbox Game Pass dovetail: Imagine a world where you pay $50-$100 for a console and $10 a month for games, and get every (or, at least, most) big-ticket new release. It's a world that might not be so far away, given that Microsoft is already experimenting with providing the Xbox and Game Pass for a monthly fee. It could be that new model that Microsoft has been looking for.So, to recap...To lay it all out: The PC gaming industry is in a time of upheaval, in a battle for a better revenue sharing model that could have ramifications for Apple and Google, too. As a result, Steam, once thought unimpeachable, is under unforeseen pressure, as \"Fortnite\" developer Epic Games pushes its leverage hard. Video game streaming is looking increasingly ready for prime time, in a move that could bring big-budget gaming to the smartphone in your pocket. This could mean that the next generation of Xbox and PlayStation will be the last to resemble what we currently think of as a video game console.

If you're not aware, there's a great deal of digital banking activity across Asia. It's not just in China, but there are notable things happening in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and more. </p><p>In particular, there has been a launch of banking licences for digital firms with Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi, Grab, SingTel and more making bids. In other words, the Big Tech giants are moving into digital banking in Asia. It's not just the Big Tech world that's moving in however, as Scott Bales[2] notes that OCBC, HSBC, UOB and Standard Chartered are also likely to be bidding for licences in Singapore. After all, why not? A large bank should have no reason to not be a challenger bank as RBS's Bo would tell you. In fact, this would follow the example of Hong Kong[3]- a first mover in awarding online-only digital banking licences - where Ant Financial, Ping An, Tencent, WeLab and more have received licences. Equally, so have Standard Chartered and Bank of China. In fact, the most interesting aspect of the HK experience is that many of the new banks are partnerships between Big Tech and Big Banks. For example, Fusion Bank is a joint venture between Tencent, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) and Hillhouse Capital. This environment of creating mobile-first online-only new digital, virtual banks is interesting and will probably diverge from the European and American markets, although some recognisable names like Revolut and Tandem Bank are also in the mix. The reason it will be different is that the culture is not the same and, with big players like Alibaba, Ping An and Tencent in the mix, it will be fascinating to see how it plays out. Meantime, assuming this is of interest, here's a comparison of the three major markets that are opening up, kindly shared by Varun on LinkedIn. <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Asia-banks-1.png\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Asia-banks-1.png</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Asia-banks-2.png\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Asia-banks-2.png</url> Finally, as it's a great link, here's a summary of the current challenger banks in Hong Kong according to FinTech Futures[4]: Ant Financial (AliPay/Alibaba) received a virtual banking licence from the Hong Kong regulators[5]in spring 2019. Fusion Bank is a joint venture between Tencent, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) and Hillhouse Capital. There is also an investment from Hong Kong entrepreneur Adrian Cheng, via Perfect Ridge Limited. Insight Virtual Bank is a joint venture of Hong-Kong based AMTD Group, Asia's largest independent investment bank, and Xiaomi Corporation, a Beijing-based internet company. Livi Virtual Bank is a joint venture between Bank of China (BOC) Hong Kong, JD New Orbit Technology and JSH Virtual Ventures Holdings (JSHVV). Neat is a Hong Kong-based start-up that offers banking accounts for businesses. It was founded in 2015 by David Rossa (CEO) and Igor Wos (CTO). Ping An OneConnect is the fintech arm of Chinese conglomerate Ping An Insurance, and received its Hong Kong virtual banking licence in spring 2019. Revolut is understood to be coming to Hong Kong. SC Digital is led by Standard Chartered, and has partnerships with Hong Kong Telecom (HKT), PCCW (a Hong Kong-based information and communication technology firm and owner of HKT), and travel services provider Ctrip Hong Kong. Tandem Bank unveiled itsplans to expand to Hong Kong[6] in November 2019. This would be the first overseas location for the UK-based bank. WeLab received a virtual banking licence in early spring 2019, claiming to be 'the first homegrown Hong Kong fintech company to establish a virtual bank'. ZhongAn Bank (ZA Bank), a Shanghai-based online-only insurer - and the first of its kind in China - received a Hong Kong virtual banking licence via its local subsidiary ZA International.

And due to the instant notifications technology, we're on the constant lookout for likes and comments on our posts. It has become as though a part of our body, which is very crucial for our existence. Just for an hour, if the servers go down, it becomes headline news and could even act as a 'career lost' scenario to numerous \"influencers\" and \"bloggers\" out there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, ever wondered why this madness? This addiction is one such aspect that BBC special and producer Diana Martin's film Smartphones: The Dark Side explores.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How did the idea come into being?</p><p>There had already been a lot of focus in the media about data and how the big tech companies were monetising our data and using it in ways that we were completely unaware of. But we felt there was another big question around social media - how addictive was it? And could social media companies and phone companies be exploiting the habit forming nature of social media to get us hooked? All of us on the production team use smartphones and other devices and are well aware of the benefits - but we were also acutely aware of how much time we were spending on these devices. Two of us had children, teenage or younger, and were frustrated by the amount of time they were spending on their devices. How much screen time should we allow them was a constant worry. So we wanted to know - are these applications addictive - and are the tech companies that develop and promote them aware of this? We wanted to speak to insiders who had worked for the social media companies to understand to what degree the companies had been aware of the potentially addictive nature of these technologies.</p><p>What are the reasons people are increasingly getting addicted to their gadgets and can't do without them for more than a few minutes?</p><p>We spoke to several scientists and read many scientific reports. The jury is still doubtful on whether social media or smartphones are actually addictive. Some scientists say that they are not addictive in the way like heroin or tobacco, but are merely habit-forming. Others say it is an addiction. One clinician we spoke to, Mandy Saligari of Charter Harley Street, said, 'Giving your child a smartphone was tantamount to giving them cocaine.' Whether you think it's habit-forming or addictive, we are all aware how we are drawn to our smartphones and social media apps. We have spoken to many tech insiders in the film who had worked for some of the biggest tech and social media companies who now had some regrets about the habit-forming power of their technologies. Two people we spoke to who had both worked for Facebook, told us they no longer used it because they were worried about its impact on them.</p><p>They believed that the reasons we feel we can't do without our gadgets is because the technology within them has been deliberately designed to hook us. The like button, the endless scroll, even the colours and sounds you see and hear, are deliberately designed to keep us coming back.</p><p>Ramsay Brown, an app developer with a background in neurosciences, explained to us that our behaviour is driven by dopamine, a brain chemical central to the cycle of reward, motivation and addiction. A social media click gives us a little hit of dopamine and we keep going back for more.</p><p>What are the various impacts of social media on our psychological health? How do 'likes' impact self-confidence levels?</p><p>Some doctors and psychologists believe that the prevalence of social media is like having a detrimental impact on mental health - particularly young people's. First, because it can be habit-forming and therefore take them away from other activities like exercise, school work, spending time with friends and families. Second, because it can negatively affect our self-esteem. And finally, because it is an additional opportunity for bullying and hate.</p><p>Leah Perlman, who worked as a product manager at Facebook until 2011 and was one of the team members at Facebook, helped developed the like button. She no longer works at Facebook. She has described her concern about how the like button fed her own insecurities and affected her self-esteem. She has given up Facebook now.</p><p>This doesn't mean it has a negative effect on all of us. For many of us, social media is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family and to share ideas, and many of us are able to keep our use of social media under control.</p><p>What measures would you suggest to reduce phone use and addiction to different gadgets and websites?</p><p>I'm not really here to tell people to reduce their phone use. However, I hope our film gives people a bit more understanding about how certain aspects of social media and smartphone technology have been developed apparently deliberately to keep us on our screens as much as possible. And armed with that knowledge, people will make the right decision for themselves about whether they want to reduce their or their children's screen time.</p><p>Do you think social media giants and app-owners are deliberately inventing habit-forming technologies to get people hooked?</p><p>Certainly, social media companies and tech giants are creating technologies designed to keep people on their apps or devices. In a way, it's understandable - all companies try to promote their goods and services as much as possible to make them attractive to their market. But this film showed that in a sophisticated and deliberate way they did develop technologies - the like button, the endless scroll, all the colours, and bells, and notifications - that will hook us. The founding president of Facebook, Sean Parker, effectively admitted this at a conference in 2017, he said, 'Building these applications was all about - how do we consume as much of your time as possible? You're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. The inventors understood this consciously. And we did it anyway.'</p><p>Do you think people form an opinion of themselves or their self-worth through their social media profiles?</p><p>Certainly, some people do. And teenagers can be particularly vulnerable to this. We spoke to one parent, Lucy Alexander, whose teenage son, Felix had tragically killed himself - after being bullied on social media. Of course, as with any suicide it's impossible to state this was the cause of his suicide - but his mother describes how even after she took him out of the school where he was being tormented by bullies, the bullying continued online. She now regularly visits schools and gives talks about the dangers of bullying on social media.</p><p>What do you think is the future of smartphone and social media use? You can answer in both positive and negative terms.</p><p>I think smartphones have changed our worlds in an enormously positive way - they have made it much easier for most of us to do our jobs; much easier to access information about anything. They've been brilliant for education and the sharing of ideas. It's much easier to do business and pay for things. And it's much much easier to keep in touch with friends and families. There are thousands of other benefits I can't go into. And I imagine in the future these benefits will multiply. But as with any new technology there's a danger that unforeseen problems will emerge.

For millions, technology has been a lifeline in a new, socially-distanced reality. All over the world, consumers forced to stay at home have tuned in to Netflix, ordered from Amazon and dialled in to Zoom calls. In the US, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/how-coronavirus-pandemic-may-change-the-way-we-grocery-shop.html\"> less than 5 per cent of grocery shopping</url> took place online before the crisis but this has surged to 10-15 per cent. Zoom says peak numbers using its video conferencing app in April were 30 times the level in December.</p><p>Some of this may recede after the exit from lockdown. But the changes under way in remote working, learning and shopping are striking. As Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, said recently: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen two years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months.\u201d The role Big Tech has played during the crisis is reflected in the surging share prices of the companies as investors have bet on their business models. Five of the big-tech stocks now constitute more than a fifth of the value of the S&amp;P 500 index \u2014 a modern-day record in terms of concentration. </p><p>For the companies, the crisis has not only cemented their market power but provided an opportunity to show that they can be responsible corporate citizens. The pandemic has underlined the benefits of these digital platforms both socially and economically, in helping to fight disinformation about Covid-19 as well as in handling the ecommerce boom. Governments, meanwhile, have looked to Big Tech to help with the development of contact tracing apps. </p><p>The sector\u2019s advance looks unlikely to be curtailed any time soon. Many of the larger players are using the crisis to get even bigger. Data show they are hunting for deals at their fastest pace since 2015. Amazon\u2019s expansion in particular seems to know no bounds; the ecommerce giant is in talks to buy the self-driving car company Zoox while its investment in food delivery service Deliveroo was given the go-ahead by UK regulators for fear the start-up might be pushed into bankruptcy. </p><p>All this presents policymakers with some tricky challenges at a time when many had been keen to restrain the dominance of the big online platforms. The politics of the \u201ctechlash\u201d have been made more complex even as the need for action has increased. It will require a nuanced response from regulators. </p><p>One area long overdue for reform remains competition law. In the US, the standard for antitrust legislation has not changed since the 1980s and remains focused on the harm to consumers. In a world of digital services, the focus needs to shift to market structure and corporate concentration. In this regard the European Commission is ahead of the US. Last April, a report commissioned by the EU called for lower bars on antitrust rules targeting \u201cdominant players\u201d. The commission on Tuesday <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_977\"> launched a public consultation</url> on its flagship digital platform regulation. It has long wanted more power to audit how companies use consumer data. </p><p>In a sign US lawmakers want to follow Brussels\u2019 lead, both Democrats and Republicans are promoting bills to ensure any data collected to fight the pandemic cannot be used for other means. Another factor in the debate over regulation, however, is the growing tension between the US and China. A technology cold war could spur a desire in Washington to nurture national \u201cchampions\u201d. While that, and the way the pandemic has burnished tech companies\u2019 image, may deter concerted action to rein them in, lawmakers should be wary of allowing today\u2019s tech giants to become so dominant that they stifle the next generation of bold and innovative disrupters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-257c3f8ca4cf11ea81ac4854aed294e5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6024-SVG1-DXP9-9006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"629\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

A report in June from survey company Dalia Research revealed a broad consensus that China has handled covid-19 far better than the US. Of the 53 countries surveyed, ranging from Denmark to Iran, only two thought the US had responded better than China: Japan and the US itself. The Dalia survey also found that across the board, public perceptions of US global influence have markedly deteriorated. Nearly as many people believe that America's impact on democracy has been negative as positive. People in stalwart democracies such as Canada, Germany, and the UK are particularly critical.</p><p>America's abject failure to deal adequately with the biggest global health emergency in a century has prompted some experts to argue that the pandemic may serve as a geopolitical inflection point. Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi wrote in March in Foreign Affairs that just as a bungled intervention in the Suez crisis precipitated the end of the British empire, \"the coronavirus pandemic could mark a 'Suez moment'\" for the US, as China \"position\u013cs] itself as the global leader in pandemic response.\"</p><p>But even if the effects are not quite that drastic, they will be profound. The US's declining stature in the wake of the pandemic is accelerating two global political trends that have emerged in the last five years.</p><p>First, rising tensions between the US and China threaten to initiate a new arms race and a return of great-power rivalry. Second, from Turkey to Brazil to Hungary to Poland, an increasing number of countries are undergoing \"autocratization,\" centralizing power and restricting political freedoms-putting an end to the post-Cold War waves of democratization that ushered in new freedoms and rights for hundreds of millions of people. Taken together, these two trends will make for a more divided and uncertain world.</p><p>A global digital divide</p><p>One visible manifestation of both the decline of US power and the resurgence of autocracy is the fragmenting of the global digital ecosystem. Since Google pulled out of China in 2010 over the government's censorship of search results, China has cultivated a walled garden of applications primarily for use by its citizens. While the decoupling isn't total-the Android and iOS mobile operating systems are prevalent, and programming languages like Java and Python are widely used-most Chinese never go on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon, PayPal, or many other platforms, but instead use their local alternatives.</p><p>This fragmentation is part of a larger normative battle. China has been joined by Russia, Iran, and other autocratic regimes in promoting cyber sovereignty-the idea that countries should set their own rules on how their citizens use the internet. In Russia, the government is planning to implement a \"sovereign internet,\" a self-contained, centrally controlled system that would allow the country to cut itself off from the global internet entirely (see \"Yandex's balancing act,\" page 38). By contrast, while the US and Europe differ on the nature and importance of privacy, the limits of free speech, and the right way to regulate Big Tech, there is broad agreement that the internet should be open and interoperable.</p><p>These trends mean that increasingly, where large countries relied on size, military force, or economic influence, they now also view technology (and not just the military kind) as one of the keys to sustaining and extending their power. This paradigm, known as \"technonationalism,\" rests on two crucial assumptions: first, that an early technological lead gives countries a first-mover advantage, and second, that dominance in certain technologies, such as artificial intelligence, gives them an edge in other fields. These assumptions do not need to be true to be influential. Under their logic, no country can afford to let competitors pull ahead.</p><p>An illustration of this was the US Commerce Department's decision in October 2019 to add 28 Chinese companies to its \"entity list\" of firms subject to trade restrictions. They include most of the leading Chinese AI firms, including iFlytek, SenseTime, and Megvii. Ostensibly, they were added as punishment for facilitating shocking human rights abuses against Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang. But a secondary result was to hinder them from competing with US companies.</p><p>More recently, in May 2020, the White House released a strategy document accusing Chinese authorities of exploiting \"the free and open rules-based order\" and attempting to \"reshape the international system in its favor.\" It calls for renewed prosecutions of Chinese trade-secret theft and a stronger process for preventing Chinese companies from acquiring advanced technologies, such as \"hypersonics, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology.\" Subsequently, US officials tightened restrictions against Chinese electronics giant Huawei by blocking the company from using US technology or machinery to manufacture its chips. In late July, the Trump administration abruptly ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, alleging that it was a hub for industrial espionage (see \"Hacker, G-man, seed thief, spy,\" page 58). China retaliated by closing the US consulate in Chengdu.</p><p>China, meanwhile, continues to lock out international companies that refuse to play by its rules-such as agreeing to censor search engine results, provide authorities with data on users, or hand over software source code and other proprietary data. It has also ramped up efforts to cultivate \"mass innovation\" and increase subsidies to strategic sectors such as AI, semiconductor chips, and aerospace through programs like \"Made in China 2025.\"</p><p>China also promotes its companies and technologies to many countries in direct competition with US, European, and other firms. Beginning in 2015, Chinese officials began touting the \"Digital Silk Road,\" focused on internet connectivity, artificial intelligence, the digital economy, telecommunications, smart cities, and cloud computing. This has led to investments in at least 20 countries, totaling nearly $40 billion, according to a 2019 estimate by the RWR Advisory Group, a consultancy.</p><p>The Trump administration's attempts to disentangle US technology supply chains from China and its moratorium on new visas for skilled foreign workers, announced in June and extended through December, only serve to help China. A report by Ishan Banerjee and Matt Sheehan published by the Paulson Institute, a think tank in Chicago, found that while Chinese-educated AI researchers produced nearly one-third of all papers accepted at the NeurIPS conference, the leading AI research meeting in the world, most Chinese researchers study, live, and work in the United States. If they are forced to leave, such talent cannot be easily replaced.</p><p>If Joe Biden is elected president, his administration will no doubt reconsider some of these policies. Jake Sullivan, a Biden campaign advisor, recently said at an event at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (where I am a fellow) that there should be \"less focus on trying to slow China down and more on running faster ourselves.\" But whatever Biden does, the competition to determine international norms and standards for critical technologies will continue.</p><p>The geopolitics of repression</p><p>Other governments are also using technology to advance their political agendas. Even before the covid-19 crisis, the world was in the midst of an autocratic resurgence. Researchers from the Varieties of Democracy project estimate that 2.6 billion people, or 35% of the world's population, are having their political liberties curtailed.</p><p>Authoritarians are using a raft of digital technologies to counter dissent, maintain political control, and stay in power. In my prior research and in an upcoming book, I document how cities in Kenya, Mexico, and Malaysia employ Chinese AI-powered technology to keep watch over citizens; how spyware from Israeli and US sources helps intelligence operatives in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt monitor dissent and track opposition figures; and how censorship and disinformation campaigns enable authorities in Thailand and Pakistan to tamp down criticism and flood digital channels with pro-government narratives.</p><p>Autocratic regimes are far more likely to use these instruments for repression, but democracies sometimes use them to curb civil rights too. In the United States, for example, the advocacy group Freedom House observes, police have used technologies such as drones, facial recognition, and social-media surveillance in response to escalating Black Lives Matter protests.</p><p>The pandemic has accelerated this attrition of individual liberties. Data collected by Samuel Woodhams of ToplOVPN, a digital privacy group, shows that as of July 2020, 50 countries had introduced contact tracing apps, 35 had adopted alternative digital tracking measures, 11 had implemented advanced physical surveillance technologies, and 18 had imposed censorship related to covid-19. Many of the countries using these techniques are democracies.</p><p>A big problem is that governments are rushing out health surveillance technology without proper vetting or oversight. Bahrain, Kuwait, and Norway all launched intrusive covid-19 tracing apps that \"actively carry out live or near-live tracking of users' locations by frequently uploading GPS coordinates to a central server,\" Amnesty International reported in June. The report caused Norway to suspend its app's rollout; Bahrain and Kuwait have not.</p><p>Of course, digital technology isn't responsible for authoritarianism's resurgence, but it gives crucial advantages to unsavory regimes. This illiberal assault is putting inordinate pressure on the liberal international order and the institutions that uphold it, including the UN, NATO, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, and others.</p><p>China and Russia stand to gain the most from this. Indeed, some experts argue that they have directly pursued a \"digital authoritarianism\" strategy: providing powerful technology to help illiberal leaders entrench their regimes, thereby creating an autocratic alternative to the liberal international order.</p><p>My own research suggests that most of these regimes would pursue antidemocratic digital strategies even without Russia's and China's help. All the same, there is reason to worry about the growing global spread of Chinese technology such as Huawei 5G networks, Transsion mobile phones, and WeChat for e-commerce and communication. Not only does this increase global reliance on Chinese technology, thereby enhancing China's influence, but many products, such as WeChat's social app or Alipay Health Code (which classifies users' health status and determines whether they are allowed to travel or enter certain public spaces), are designed to facilitate government surveillance and censorship. As Christopher Walker, Shanthi Kalathil, and Jessica Ludwig wrote this year in the Journal of Democracy, \"The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] has been forging an increasingly seamless synthesis combining consumer convenience, surveillance, and censorship. This model is exemplified by such all-encompassing platforms as WeChat ... which includes politically based content restrictions and lends itself to surveillance.\" (See also the interview with Samantha Hoffman on page 56.)</p><p>Of course, technologies are often twoedged swords. Digital tools help civic movements, journalists, and political challengers. The ability of social-media networks to rapidly mobilize citizens and swell mass protests is a potent threat that no regime has fully neutralized.</p><p>It's also worth remembering that while the US-China rivalry can dominate discussions about the future of technology, it's not the only thing determining where trends are headed. The European Union, for example, is increasingly staking out its own independent policy positions. It's emphasizing privacy, accountability for big tech firms, and transparency for big data and AI. India, Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria, and Indonesia are all deciding whether to try to carve out their own digital agendas or to act more as fence-sitters, playing China, the US, and the EU against one another.</p><p>Though commentators like Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group warn of a \"great decoupling\" between the US and China, with dire consequences for technology, talk of a new bipolar Cold War is overblown. There are too many new players and too many variables to assume that two superpowers will monopolize the rules of technology for the foreseeable future. Instead, we are likely to witness increased splintering as fresh ideas come to the fore, new platforms gain followings, and more people get online for the first time. A multipolar world with new, diverse sources of ideas, innovation, regulation, and geopolitical influence may not be such a bad thing at all.</p><p>Steven Feldstein is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECRVW-2436416116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECRVWSeptember 2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R9-FTN1-JBHT-D1M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381140</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright September 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright September 2020 Technology Review, Inc.

What is the line between freedom of speech and cybercrimes? This is a discussion being deliberated across the world, and governments all over are having to strike a delicate balance between governance and freedoms regarding the internet.</p><p>It is doubtful that this line is being maintained in Pakistan, however, with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA)'s recent policy. PTA made it mandatory for customers to register Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with telecom authorities. This means that users will be unable to browse the web using encryption software without registration after June 30.</p><p>PTA has justified the requirement by stating that it is partly to promote legal ICT services/business in Pakistan and the safety of telecom users. Those using VoIP and VPNs for terminating illegal traffic caused loss to the exchequer by avoiding applicable taxes. While this explanation does make sense, it is important that PTA also weigh the heavy costs that come with this move. There are very legitimate reasons for the use of VPNs, which include ensuring privacy and anonymity on local servers; many businesses use it to protect sensitive information, including account numbers and passwords. This requirement would be a further hassle to the ease of doing business.</p><p>Not only this, but the mandatory registration is a step towards curtailing privacy in an environment which is already dangerously close to surveillance. The debate on data privacy in Pakistan has yet to begin properly. Security should not only be the angle that the government should approach the Internet with. The use of VPNs for protection against insecure networks and as a means to protect your own data and fool advertisers cannot be overstated. Registering VPNs and adding a whole new means of regulations and red tape is tantamount to banning them almost.</p><p>The government needs to decide who it is governing the Internet for. Is it only a means to monitor citizens online and allow for businesses to use the web as a large marketplace that also allows for advertising  or is cyberspace a realm where netizens can choose to exercise their rights and liberties freely, and be safe in the knowledge that the state will protect their interests at all costs?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNTION-THENATION1806202000096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNTION2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605B-Y851-F00C-62XK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">384234</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nawai Waqt Group of Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation (AsiaNet)</publicationName><volume>Vol. 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 90</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Pakistan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926130QC</classCode><className>COMMUNICATIONS LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Communications</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926130QJ</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DAPY</classCode><className>CRYPTOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

En un segundo mandato, Trump y sus designados probablemente mantendr\u00edan, y posiblemente acelerar\u00edan, el escrutinio regulatorio a gran escala de las empresas de tecnolog\u00eda que marc\u00f3 su primer mandato. Ese esfuerzo ha incluido acusaciones de parcialidad anticonservadora online, las investigaciones antimonopolio de los gigantes de internet, como Google de Alphabet y Facebook, y acciones contra aplicaciones de propiedad china como TikTok y WeChat (ayer el gobierno de EE.UU. anunci\u00f3 que, a partir de ma\u00f1ana, bloquear\u00e1 las descargas de la primera y bloquear\u00eda la segunda).   Biden, el candidato dem\u00f3crata, tambi\u00e9n ha criticado el poder de mercado de las grandes tecnolog\u00edas. \u00c9l y su compa\u00f1era de f\u00f3rmula, la senadora Kamala Harris dicen que apoyar\u00edan una supervisi\u00f3n antimonopolio m\u00e1s estricta y reglas de privacidad online. Pero el bando de Biden ha hecho hincapi\u00e9 en obligar a las empresas de redes sociales a vigilar mejor sus sitios contra la informaci\u00f3n falsa y en tomar medidas gubernamentales para ayudar a los trabajadores amenazados por innovaciones como los autom\u00f3viles aut\u00f3nomos.   Dado que el Congreso tambi\u00e9n se centra en las grandes tecnolog\u00edas, es probable que ambos candidatos participen en los esfuerzos legislativos para aumentar la competencia en los mercados digitales, ampliar el acceso de banda ancha y proteger la privacidad de los consumidores.   \u201cEl enfoque de no intervenci\u00f3n se ha ido, independientemente de qui\u00e9n gane las elecciones\u201d, dijo Gene Kimmelman, un ex funcionario antimonopolio de la administraci\u00f3n Obama que recientemente coescribi\u00f3 un documento en el que ped\u00eda una nueva agencia para regular las grandes plataformas digitales.   La administraci\u00f3n Obama, en la que Biden se desempe\u00f1\u00f3 como vicepresidente, desarroll\u00f3 una reputaci\u00f3n amigable con la tecnolog\u00eda, contrat\u00f3 a veteranos de Silicon Valley para puestos clave y se neg\u00f3 a presentar quejas antimonopolio contra Google y otros. A algunos cr\u00edticos tecnol\u00f3gicos, conservadores y progresistas por igual, les preocupa que una administraci\u00f3n de Biden vuelva a adoptar esa postura, resolviendo cualquier caso antimonopolio presentado por la administraci\u00f3n Trump en t\u00e9rminos indulgentes.   El portavoz de la campa\u00f1a de Biden, Matt Hill, se neg\u00f3 a comentar sobre la posibilidad de resolver los casos antimonopolio, pero sugiri\u00f3 que Biden ser\u00eda duro.   \u201cJoe Biden ha dicho durante mucho tiempo que uno de los pecados m\u00e1s grandes es el abuso de poder\u201d, dijo Hill. \u201cMuchos gigantes de la tecnolog\u00eda y sus ejecutivos no solo han abusado de su poder, sino que han enga\u00f1ado al pueblo estadounidense, han da\u00f1ado nuestra democracia y han evadido cualquier forma de responsabilidad. Eso termina con un presidente Biden\u201d.  M\u00e1s sobre  The Wall Street Journal  La campa\u00f1a de Trump dice que la indulgencia termin\u00f3 con las elecciones de 2016. El Departamento de Justicia de la administraci\u00f3n Trump ha estado investigando a Google por una posible conducta anticompetitiva en su negocio de b\u00fasqueda y publicidad y se espera que presente un caso, antes de las elecciones, que probablemente se trasladar\u00eda a 2021 y m\u00e1s all\u00e1. La Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Comercio tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 investigando a las empresas de tecnolog\u00eda por posibles infracciones antimonopolio, incluida la preparaci\u00f3n de una posible demanda contra Facebook.   Durante las primarias dem\u00f3cratas, Biden no se uni\u00f3 a los progresistas que ped\u00edan disolver las firmas de Big Tech, diciendo que ser\u00eda prematuro hacerlo antes de una investigaci\u00f3n formal. Este verano, un grupo de trabajo pol\u00edtico que cre\u00f3 Biden con el senador de Vermont, Bernie Sanders, su \u00faltimo oponente en las primarias dem\u00f3cratas, recomend\u00f3 dividir las empresas por comportamiento anticompetitivo \u201ccomo \u00faltimo recurso\u201d.   Sin embargo, Biden ha dicho que la aplicaci\u00f3n de las leyes antimonopolio no ha sido lo suficientemente fuerte y que las empresas de tecnolog\u00eda merecen una mirada atenta por parte de las agencias federales que supervisan la competencia.   Trump tampoco ha pedido rupturas tecnol\u00f3gicas, aunque ese es uno de los posibles resultados de las continuas investigaciones antimonopolio.   Un enfoque particular para un segundo mandato de Trump ser\u00eda la legislaci\u00f3n para reducir las protecciones de las que disfrutan las empresas de redes sociales, en virtud de la Secci\u00f3n 230 de la Ley de Decencia en las Comunicaciones de 1996, que les otorga una amplia inmunidad legal para el contenido publicado y sus esfuerzos por moderarlo. Trump dice que la ley se ha utilizado para censurar puntos de vista conservadores.   El mandatario pidi\u00f3 la derogaci\u00f3n de la Secci\u00f3n 230 en un tweet del 8 de septiembre, haci\u00e9ndose eco de una posici\u00f3n que Biden tom\u00f3 a principios de este a\u00f1o con una motivaci\u00f3n muy diferente. Aun as\u00ed, la ley se considera fundamental para internet y tiene apoyo bipartidista.   Trump orden\u00f3 a las agencias reguladoras este a\u00f1o que consideren una supervisi\u00f3n m\u00e1s estricta de las empresas online, bajo la Secci\u00f3n 230 cuando no moderen el discurso de los usuarios de manera justa o no cumplan con sus promesas relacionadas con la libertad de expresi\u00f3n.   Biden sorprendi\u00f3 al mundo de la tecnolog\u00eda cuando pidi\u00f3 la revocaci\u00f3n de la Secci\u00f3n 230. Pero a diferencia de los conservadores, dice que algunas plataformas de redes sociales realizan muy poca vigilancia, no demasiada.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNES-43110379146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W3-YGN1-F07F-82XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398831</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"970\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>La Tercera</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Spanish</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>18 Septiembre 2020 Viernes</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Chile</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTM3OTI0NjBDQTRBNEFCN0JFMkY3MDJCMDU3MERCNzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDMxOEI4OTIwRTQ5NEVBQUJBRTU5RjM2RUM2QjAzMEE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>Government Departments + Authorities</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>Internet Social Networking</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000649</classCode><className>Espionage</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001739</classCode><className>Trade Treaties + Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode><className>Trade Agreements</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>Weapons + Arms</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000A4JJ</classCode><className>Guilty Pleas</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFCRjAwOERDM0JGNDQ4QjhEODU0MDYxOUE3QUY2RjM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc1MDBENkU0ODJCNDQ5MzkxNEFERjkzQTYwODQzRDA</classCode><className>Guilty Pleas</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>Internet + WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

They packed themselves into a cheerful courtyard outside the main campus caf\u00e9, a parklike area dotted with picnic tables and a shade structure that resembles a giant game of pickup sticks. Many of them held up handmade signs: \"Proud Iranian-American Googler,\" \"Even Introverts Are Here,\" and of course, \"Don't Be Evil!\" written in the same kindergarten colors as the Google logo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a few rounds of call-and-response chanting and testimonials from individual staffers, someone adjusted the rally's microphone for the next speaker's tall, lanky frame. Sundar Pichai, Google's soft-spoken CEO of 15 months, stood in the small clearing in the dense crowd that served as a makeshift stage. \"Over the last 24 to 48 hours, we've all been working very hard,\" he said, \"and every step of the way I've felt the support of 60,000 people behind me.\"</p><p>It was, to be precise, January 30; Donald Trump's presidency was 10 days old. And Executive Order 13769-a federal travel ban on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, and a wholesale suspension of US refugee admissions-had been in effect for 73 hours, trapping hundreds of travelers in limbo at the nation's airports. For the moment, the company's trademark admonition against evil was being directed at a clear, unmistakably external target: the White House.</p><p>To all the world it looked as if Google-one of the most powerful, pro-immigrant, and ostensibly progressive corporations in the United States-was taking a unified stand. But that appearance of unanimity masked a welter of executive-level indecision and anxiety. It probably would have been more apt if Pichai had said that, over the previous 48 hours, he had been backed into a corner by thousands of his employees.</p><p>In those first days of the Trump era, Google's leaders were desperate to avoid confrontation with the new regime. The company's history of close ties to the Obama administration left executives feeling especially vulnerable to the reactionary movement-incubated partly on Google's own video platform, YouTube-that had memed, rallied, and voted Trump into office. (It didn't help that Eric Schmidt, then executive chairman of Google's parent company, Alphabet, had been an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign, or that some 90 percent of political donations by Google employees had gone to Democrats in 2016.) Kent Walker, Google's risk-averse vice president of public policy, had been advising staffers not to do anything that might upset Steve Bannon or Breitbart. So when the travel ban was announced on the afternoon of Friday, January 27, Google executives initially hoped to \"just keep [their] heads down and allow it to blow over,\" according to an employee who was close to those early calculations.</p><p>But the tribal dictates of Google's own workforce made lying low pretty much impossible. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the former Montessori kids who founded Google as Stanford grad students in the late '90s, had designed their company's famously open culture to facilitate free thinking. Employees were \"obligated to dissent\" if they saw something they disagreed with, and they were encouraged to \"bring their whole selves\" to work rather than check their politics and personal lives at the door. And the wild thing about Google was that so many employees complied. They weighed in on thousands of online mailing lists, including IndustryInfo, a mega forum with more than 30,000 members; Coffee Beans, a forum for discussing diversity; and Poly-Discuss, a list for polyamorous Googlers. They posted incessantly on an employee-only version of Google+ and on Memegen, an internal tool for creating and upvoting memes. On Thursdays, Google would host a company-wide meeting called TGIF, known for its no-holds-barred Q&amp;As where employees could, and did, aggressively challenge executives.</p><p>All that oversharing and debate was made possible by another element of Google's social contract. Like other corporations, Google enforces strict policies requiring employees to keep company business confidential. But for Google employees, nondisclosure wasn't just a rule, it was a sacred bargain-one that earned them candor from leadership and a safe space to speak freely about their kinks, grievances, and disagreements on internal forums.</p><p>Finally, to a remarkable extent, Google's workers really do take \"Don't Be Evil\" to heart. C-suite meetings have been known to grind to a halt if someone asks, \"Wait, is this evil?\" To many employees, it's axiomatic: Facebook is craven, Amazon is aggro, Apple is secretive, and Microsoft is staid, but Google genuinely wants to do good.</p><p>All of those precepts sent Google's workforce into full tilt after the travel ban was announced. Memegen went flush with images bearing captions like \"We stand with you\" and \"We are you.\" Jewglers and HOLA, affinity groups for Jewish and Latinx employees, quickly pledged their support for Google's Muslim group. According to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wall Street Journal,</emphasis> members of one mailing list brainstormed whether there might be ways to \"leverage\" Google's search results to surface ways of helping immigrants; some proposed that the company should intervene in searches for terms like \"Islam,\" \"Muslim,\" or \"Iran\" that were showing \"Islamophobic, algorithmically biased results.\" (Google says none of those ideas were taken up.) At around 2 pm that Saturday, an employee on a mailing list for Iranian Googlers floated the possibility of staging a walkout in Mountain View. \"I wanted to check first whether anyone thinks this is a bad idea,\" the employee wrote. Within 48 hours, a time had been locked down and an internal website set up.</p><p>Employees also spent the weekend protesting as private citizens, out in the open. At San Francisco International Airport, a handful of Google lawyers showed up to offer emergency representation to immigrants; many more staffers joined a demonstration outside the international terminal. But one Googler in particular made national newscasts. On Saturday night, without informing anyone at Google, Sergey Brin showed up at the airport to join the crowds. He offered no other comment to the press except to tell <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Forbes</emphasis>, \"I'm here because I'm a refugee,\" and to make clear that he was there in a personal capacity.</p><p>Between pressure from employees and Brin's trip to the airport-which had effectively committed the company to sticking its neck out-Google's own official calculations began to shift. Over the course of the weekend, the company matched $2 million in donations raised by employees for crisis funds for immigrants' rights. And then on Monday, at the last minute, Pichai decided to speak at the employees' demonstration.</p><p>In his short, off-the-cuff remarks to the packed courtyard, Pichai called immigration \"core to the founding of this company.\" He tried to inject a dose of moderation, stressing how important it was \"to reach out and communicate to people from across the country.\" But when he mentioned Brin's appearance at the airport, his employees erupted in chants of \"Ser-gey! Ser-gey! Ser-gey!\" Brin finally extricated himself from the crowd and shuffled up to the mic, windbreaker in hand. He, too, echoed the protesters' concerns but tried to bring the heat down. \"We need to be smart,\" he said, \"and that means bringing in folks who have some different viewpoints.\" As he spoke, a news chopper flew overhead.</p><p>And that was pretty much the last time Google's executives and workers presented such a united front about anything.</p><p>As the Trump era wore on, Google continued to brace itself for all manner of external assaults, and not just from the right. The 2016 election and its aftermath set off a backlash against Silicon Valley that seemed to come from all sides. Lawmakers and the media were waking up to the extractive nature of Big Tech's free services. And Google-the company that had casually introduced the internet to consumer surveillance, orderer of the world's information, owner of eight products with more than a billion users each-knew that it would be an inevitable target.</p><p>But in many respects, Google's most vexing threats during that period came from inside the company itself. Over the next two and a half years, the company would find itself in the same position over and over again: a nearly $800 billion planetary force seemingly powerless against groups of employees-on the left and the right alike-who could hold the company hostage to its own public image.</p><p>In a larger sense, Google found itself and its culture deeply maladapted to a new set of political, social, and business imperatives. To invent products like Gmail, Earth, and Translate, you need coddled geniuses free to let their minds run wild. But to lock down lucrative government contracts or expand into coveted foreign markets, as Google increasingly needed to do, you need to be able to issue orders and give clients what they want.</p><p>For this article, WIRED spoke with 47 current and former Google employees. Most of them requested anonymity. Together, they described a period of growing distrust and disillusionment inside Google that echoed the fury roaring outside the company's walls. And in all that time, Google could never quite anticipate the right incoming collision. After the travel ban walkout, for example, the company's leaders expected the worst-and that it would come from Washington. \"I knew we were snowballing toward something,\" a former executive says. \"I thought it was going to be Trump calling us out in the press. I didn't think it was gonna be some guy writing a memo.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">II.</emphasis></p><p>In a lot of ways, google's internal social networks are like a microcosm of the internet itself. They have their filter bubbles, their trolls, their edgelords. And contrary to popular perception, those networks are not all populated by liberals. Just as the reactionary right was rising on YouTube, it was also finding ways to amplify itself inside Google's rationalist culture of debate.</p><p>For some time, for instance, one of the moderators of the company's Conservatives email list was a Chrome engineer named Kevin Cernekee. Over the years, Google employees have described Cernekee fairly consistently: as a shrewd far-right provocateur who made his presence felt across Google's social network, trolling both liberals and conservatives.</p><p>In August 2015, the giant IndustryInfo mailing list broke into a roiling debate over why there were so few women in tech. The previous year, Google had become the first Silicon Valley giant to release data on the demographics of its workforce-and revealed that 82 percent of its technical workers were male. To many inside the IndustryInfo thread, the number constituted clear and galling evidence that Google had to change. When the conversation devolved into a brawl over the merits of diversity-one that Cernekee joined-a senior vice president at Google attempted to shut it down. Cernekee proceeded to bombard the executive's Google+ page with posts about his right to critique the pro-diversity \"Social Justice political agenda.\" \"Can we add a clear statement of banned opinions to the employee handbook,\" he wrote, \"so that everybody knows what the ground rules are?\" In response, Google HR issued Cernekee a written warning for \"disrespectful, disruptive, disorderly, and insubordinate\" comments.</p><p>Google also took action against employees on the opposite side of the debate for their conduct in the same thread; but disciplining Cernekee had more lasting consequences. In November 2015, Cernekee filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board claiming that Google's warning constituted retaliation for his political views. He also alleged that the reprimand interfered with his right to engage in \"protected concerted activity\"-essentially, his right to freely discuss workplace conditions-as defined under the National Labor Relations Act.</p><p>As Cernekee entered into a years-long legal battle with Google, he stayed active on internal channels. In 2016, when members of a white nationalist group called the Golden Gate Skinheads clashed with antifa counterprotesters in a Sacramento park, Cernekee spoke up for the former on Google's Free Speech mailing list. Though he said he was \"the farthest thing possible from a Nazi,\" Cernekee argued that the skinheads \"stood up for free speech and free association.\" And in January 2017, when the prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer was punched in the head by a masked protester after Trump's inauguration, Cernekee told his fellow list members that \"the battle over free speech is escalating.\" He asked them to donate to a WeSearchr campaign that was raising a bounty for anyone who could track down the identity of the assailant. When mailing list members said that WeSearchr-a far-right answer to GoFundMe founded by the agitators Charles C. Johnson and Pax Dickinson-seemed shady, Cernekee wrote, \"It is completely on the up-and-up. Please don't slander my friends. :-(.\"</p><p>But as conspicuous as Cernekee was inside Google, he was all but invisible on the open internet. Consequently, it wasn't Cernekee who would become Google's most famous heretic. That distinction would fall to a comparatively reticent Google Search engineer named James Damore.</p><p>In late June 2017, Damore attended a company event about promoting diversity at Google, hosted at the Mountain View headquarters. There, he claims, he heard organizers discuss providing extra job interviews and more welcoming environments for women and underrepresented minorities. (Google says it does not provide additional interviews for people belonging to specific demographics.) To Damore, this all sounded like a violation of Google's meritocratic hiring process, a finely tuned system built to identify objectively qualified engineers.</p><p>Soon after, on the plane ride back from a work trip to China, Damore wrote a 10-page memo arguing that biological differences could help explain why there were fewer female engineers at Google, and therefore the company's attempts to reach gender parity were misguided and discriminatory toward men. On average, he wrote, women are more interested in people than things, more empathetic, more neurotic, and less assertive. To support these claims about personality differences, Damore cited two studies, three Wikipedia pages, and an article from Quillette, a contrarian online magazine that often covers free speech on campus and alleged links between genetics and IQ. In the memo, Damore wrote that hiring practices aimed to increase diversity \"can effectively lower the bar\" at Google.</p><p>All through July, Damore tried to get Google's management to pay attention to his concerns. He sent his memo to the diversity summit's organizers; he sent it to Google's human resources department; at the suggestion of a coworker, he posted it in Coffee Beans, the internal listserv for discussions about diversity. He made the same points in person at one of Google's \"Bias Busting\" workshops, where employees role-play how to identify unconscious bias against minorities. (There, he later claimed, his coworkers laughed at him.)</p><p>Damore framed his memo as an appeal for intellectual diversity, identifying his reasoning as a conservative political position silenced by Google's \"ideological echo chamber.\" \"It's a perspective that desperately needs to be told at Google,\" Damore wrote.</p><p>Plenty of Damore's colleagues, however, had heard this perspective before. Ad nauseam. \"People would write stuff like that every month,\" says one former Google executive. When the subject of diversifying Google's workforce comes up in big meetings and internal forums, one black female employee says, \"you pretty much need to wait about 10 seconds before someone jumps in and says we're lowering the bar.\" (After one diversity town hall in April 2015, an employee wrote in an internal Google+ post that Google was \"lowering the hiring bar for minorities, or arranging events where white men feel excluded.\") What's more, the debate kept coming up in a repetitive loop because of the constant influx of young graduates who were engaging in these discussions for the first time. Google was hiring at a breakneck pace at the time. Between 2015 and 2017, it added some 20,000 full-time employees, about the same number as Facebook's entire workforce. (And even after all that hiring, Google's technical workforce was 80 percent male, 56 percent white, and 41 percent Asian.)</p><p>Damore's memo might have faded into obscurity if a colleague hadn't suggested that he share it with some more receptive audiences inside Google. On Wednesday, August 2, Damore posted his memo to an internal mailing list called Skeptics. The next day he shared it with Liberty, an internal list for libertarians-one Damore hadn't known existed. By Friday, the tech blog Motherboard was reporting that an \"anti-diversity manifesto\" had gone viral inside Google.</p><p>Pichai was on vacation when his deputies told him that Google had better deal with the Damore situation quickly. Pichai agreed and asked to corral his full management team for a meeting. By Saturday, a full copy of Damore's document had leaked to Gizmodo. While Googlers waited for an official response from the top, managers who wanted to signal their support for women loudly condemned the memo's ideas on internal Google+ posts.</p><p>To Liz Fong-Jones, a site reliability engineer at Google, the memo's arguments were especially familiar. Google's engineers are not unionized, but inside Google, Fong-Jones essentially performed the function of a union rep, translating employee concerns to managers on everything from product decisions to inclusion practices. She had acquired this informal role around the time the company released Google+ to the public in 2011; before launch, she warned executives against requiring people to use their real names on the platform, arguing that anonymity was important for vulnerable groups. When public uproar played out much as Fong-Jones had predicted, she sat across from executives to negotiate a new policy-then explained the necessary compromises to irate employees. After that, managers and employees started coming to her to mediate internal tensions of all sorts.</p><p>As part of this internal advocacy work, Fong-Jones had become attuned to the way discussions about diversity on internal forums were beset by men like Cernekee, Damore, and other coworkers who were \"just asking questions.\" To her mind, Google's management had allowed these dynamics to fester for too long, and now it was time for executives to take a stand. In an internal Google+ post, she wrote that \"the only way to deal with all the heads of the medusa is to no-platform all of them.\"</p><p>A few hours later, Google's internal networks received a shock to the system. A screenshot of Fong-Jones' \"Medusa\" comment appeared on Vox Popoli, a blog run by the alt-right instigator Theodore Beale, along with her full name and profile photo. The comments section quickly filled with racial and sexual slurs fixated personally on Fong-Jones, who is trans. \"They should pitch all those sexual freaks off of rooftops,\" one anonymous Vox Popoli commenter wrote.</p><p>On Monday morning, Google's top management finally met to discuss what to do about Damore. The room, according to reporting by Recode, was split. Half the executives believed Damore shouldn't be fired. Then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and head of communications Jessica Powell urged their colleagues to consider how they would have reacted if Damore had applied the same arguments to race, rather than gender. That persuaded them: The engineer had to go. In a note to employees, Pichai said he was firing Damore for perpetuating gender stereotypes.</p><p>In his message, Pichai tried to assure the left without alienating the right. \"To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK,\" he wrote. \"At the same time, there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority viewpoint). They too feel under threat, and that is also not OK. People must feel free to express dissent.\" Then he promised to fly back to the Bay Area for a TGIF meeting on Thursday where the employees could discuss the matter.</p><p>Damore's termination set off a predictable onslaught of negative coverage from the right. Tucker Carlson, Ann Coulter, and Ben Shapiro all bashed Google; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> columnist David Brooks called for Pichai to resign. Damore gave his first interviews to YouTubers Jordan Peterson and Stefan Molyneux, the latter of whom is a proponent of \"race realism.\" The alt-right took this as an endorsement and started churning out memes of Damore, his head on Martin Luther's body, nailing his memo to the door of a church.</p><p>More leaks from inside Google fed the frenzy. Screenshots of conversations among Google employees on internal social networks, some dating back to 2015, appeared on Breitbart. Meanwhile, on a pro-Trump subreddit, a collage appeared that showed the full names, profile pictures, and Twitter bios of eight Google employees, most of them queer, transgender, or people of color. Fong-Jones was one of them. Each bio featured phrases that would make the employees instant targets for online harassment: \"polyamorous queer autistic trans lesbian,\" \"just another gay communist site reliability engineer,\" or, in Fong-Jones' case, \"Trans and queer as fuck.\" Two days after Damore was fired, Milo Yiannopoulos, the former tech editor at Breitbart, shared the Reddit collage image with 2 million Facebook followers. \"Look at who works for Google, it all makes sense now,\" he wrote-as if these eight employees had been the ones who made the decision to ax Damore.</p><p>For the employees who were being targeted, the leaks were terrifying. How many of their coworkers were feeding material to the alt-right? How many more leaks were coming? And what was their employer going to do to protect them?</p><p>In the past Google had fired an employee for leaking internal memes from Memegen. But when the targeted employees reported harassment, they say, Google's security team told them that the leaking of screenshots might fall under the legal definition of \"protected concerted activity\"-the same labor right invoked by Cernekee.</p><p>To Fong-Jones, the security team's answer was both shocking and instructive; she didn't realize a leaker could be protected. \"Everyone thought Google had an absolute right to stop you from talking about anything related to Google,\" she says. Yet here Google's hands were apparently tied by labor law.</p><p>Executives felt that they were doing everything they could. They offered to put up employees who had been doxed in a hotel for the night. But to the targeted employees, it felt as though Google was allowing fear of a far-right backlash and the threat of further lawsuits to trump the safety concerns of loyal employees. (A spokesperson for Google declined to specify whether the company managed to uncover the identity of the leakers in this case but said it investigates all such incidents and enforces its policies without regard to politics.)</p><p>By the day when Pichai was supposed to answer questions about Damore at TGIF, chaos surrounded Google. That afternoon, Damore returned to campus with a photographer whom <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> had recently dubbed \"the Annie Leibovitz of the alt-right.\" \"Live in Mountain View,\" the engineer tweeted, teasing some impending spectacle to his 40,000 new Twitter fans. Punchy tech reporters, sensing an opening, solicited employees to send them a live readout from the town hall.</p><p>Forty-five minutes before the meeting was supposed to start, Pichai sent his 78,000 employees an email. \"TL;DR Sorry for the late notice, but we are going to cancel today's Town Hall,\" he wrote. \"We had hoped to have a frank, open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward.\" But the questions employees had submitted for discussion at the meeting, he wrote, had been leaked to the press and were already appearing in outlets like WIRED. He also alluded, vaguely, to the employees who had been doxed as part of his rationale for canceling the meeting. \"On some websites Googlers are now being named personally,\" Pichai wrote.</p><p>Fong-Jones was at home in Brooklyn when she received Pichai's email. She had wanted the executives to explain why, given their reasons for firing Damore, they had let his memo float around Google for more than a month. Now it felt as if Google was using the abuse she and other employees had experienced as an excuse to not answer questions. \"That 100 percent did not sit right with me,\" she says. \"That wasn't going to make me any safer. In fact, it was a triumph, almost, for the people harassing me.\"</p><p>In her internal advocacy work, Fong-Jones had always been happy to meet senior managers on their terms. She kept their secrets. She followed the rules. And she instructed others to do the same. Executives talked to people they trusted, and they didn't trust people who talked to outsiders. But now Fong-Jones decided to take matters into her own hands. In October she invited a labor group that normally organizes blue-collar workers to teach Googlers more about protected concerted activity. Perhaps a knowledge of labor law would come in handy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">III.</emphasis></p><p>In the beginning, google gave its employees freedom because doing so paid off. Some of the company's first multibillion-dollar wins came from granting engineers autonomy and stoking their ambitions. In 2002 five engineers coding through the weekend came up with the core insight behind AdWords, the source of much of the company's revenue. The engineers weren't on the ads team and hadn't been asked to work on the problem. But they saw a note Larry Page had left in the office kitchen on a Friday afternoon saying \"THESE ADS SUCK.\" By 5 am Monday the engineers had sent out a link with a prototype of their proposed solution.</p><p>That breakthrough set the stage for what seemed like a virtuous cycle. Because Google made its money by showing people ads, it had a vested interest in growing the internet itself, and in finding new ways to make it useful. Free, world-changing products poured out: Search, Gmail, Chrome, Maps, Docs, Photos, Translate. To the lucky beneficiaries-the company's billions of users-it was almost as if Google were a public works department and not a capitalist enterprise at all. The best engineers on earth flocked to enlist, and the company offered them time to spend on their own larks. Google saw office perks, employee freedom, and lofty missions as a proven recipe for staying ahead in a changing world.</p><p>Over time, Google's leaders codified this radical culture and evangelized it to the outside world, as if Google had found a way to suspend the ordinary laws of management and commerce. In their best-selling 2014 book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How Google Works,</emphasis> Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg, two of the main architects of Google's culture, stressed the importance of open debate in the care and feeding of innovative people. \"In our experience, most smart creatives have strong opinions and are itching to spout off; for them, the cultural obligation to dissent gives them the freedom to do just that,\" they wrote. They stressed the importance of rooting out \"knaves\" (liars, cheaters, loafers) but supporting and protecting \"divas,\" difficult but brilliant employees who can grate on other employees' nerves. \"You need these aberrant geniuses because they're the ones that drive, in most cases, the product excellence,\" Schmidt said in an interview with WIRED earlier this year. \"They are better than other technical people.\"</p><p>Google's culture helped recruiting, it helped retention, and it kept the public and regulators rapt with admiration.</p><p>One of Google's paradigmatic divas was Andy Rubin, the cofounder of Android, a startup that Google acquired in 2005 for an estimated $50 million. Rubin was known for being territorial, demanding, and impressively inventive. Journalists rarely failed to mention his penchant for oddball devices, including a doorbell at his home with a robotic arm that rang a gong on the interior, and a retinal scanner on the exterior. (\"The system makes it easier to deal with former girlfriends,\" reported a 2007 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> profile, paraphrasing Rubin. \"No messy scenes retrieving keys-it's just a simple database update.\")</p><p>As executives saw it, Rubin delivered handsomely for Google. More than anyone else, he ensured the company's safe and profitable transition into the mobile era. As users moved from desktops to smartphones, Android's open source operating system acted as a Trojan horse for Google's consumer apps, most importantly search. By 2013, Android had a billion users, and its success afforded Rubin unbelievable perks, including a $14 million loan with a 1 percent interest rate to buy a beach house in Japan. Page was particularly grateful. At one point he awarded Rubin a $150 million stock grant, before Google's compensation committee even approved the offer.</p><p>Google didn't invent all the concepts that charged its culture. (\"Obligation to dissent,\" for example, is borrowed from the management consulting firm McKinsey.) But it tied them together into a coherent, aspirational narrative about engineers as a free-thinking people uniquely capable of reconfiguring the world from first principles. This culture helped recruiting, it helped retention, and it kept the public and regulators rapt with admiration. So what if Google was becoming inordinately powerful? The monopolies of the past engaged in price-gouging and became less inventive. Google's products stayed free and continued to blow your mind.</p><p>Occasionally, of course, a glitch would mar Google's image as a benign, gravity-defying force in world markets, but even those glitches would sometimes resolve in ways that reinforced the myth. In 2006, eager to tap into a growing market, Google opened an office in Beijing and launched a censored version of its search engine in China. Employees saw this as a clear violation of Google's principles; they were supposed to make the world's information universally accessible, not suppress it. The project quickly went awry. Executives had hoped that Google's presence in China would make the country more open, not closed. Instead, it emboldened the government to demand more concessions. Then, in December 2009, Google discovered a sophisticated cyberattack, originating inside China, designed to access the Gmail accounts of dissidents and human rights activists. Brin, who had been extremely reluctant to enter China all along, convinced Page that they should stop complying with China's censorship rules and tell the public about the attack.</p><p>At the time, Google was run as a triumvirate, with CEO Eric Schmidt playing the role of resident grown-up. Schmidt argued that if Google stopped censoring search results, it would never get back into China. But Page and Brin were unmoved. In January 2010, employees at Google's office in Beijing learned from a public blog post that the company was pulling back from China. In an emotional teleconference, they told executives they felt abandoned.</p><p>The reaction in Mountain View, however, was euphoric. At the TGIF meeting that week, employees burst into thunderous applause and gave Brin a standing ovation. \"The legacy of the China decision was a giant dose of goodwill from Googlers around the world,\" Schmidt wrote in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How Google Works</emphasis>; it reaffirmed the company's principles \"governing how all tough decisions should be made.\"</p><p>Within five years, however, the costs of that decision-and the limits of Google's entire formula for success-were starting to become uncomfortably clear. Google was still minting money, but ad revenue growth was slowing, and the cost of hiring engineers and funding R&amp;D was climbing fast. Investors wanted to know what was next, and Google didn't have a convincing answer. The company was making incredible strides in artificial intelligence, but its growth online was increasingly boxed in by social networking sites. For users hanging out inside Facebook or talking to Alexa, Google's apps were no longer a click away. And while the company's founders tinkered with self-driving cars and helium balloons that beamed the internet down to earth, Amazon had built up a huge advantage in an area that should have been Google's to lose: cloud computing.</p><p>Page and Brin had been focused on the cloud for more than a decade. They had built a sublime constellation of data centers around the world to power Google's own products like Gmail, a service that, for vast swaths of users, had normalized the idea of surrendering your data to a company's remote servers. But Google's MO was building products that a billion people would use by default-not closing deals, managing contracts, and customizing infrastructure for other companies.</p><p>Amazon had no such compunctions. In 2006 it began marketing a simple but highly effective cloud computing platform to other firms, ultimately offering clients like NASA and Netflix on-demand access to computing power, including storing and processing data. By the time Google finally offered a comparable service called Google Cloud Platform, in 2012, Amazon was already leagues ahead. In April 2015, Bezos revealed that Amazon Web Services had brought in $4.6 billion in revenue the previous year and was on track to out-earn his retail business soon. Google's earnings call was the same day. The company reported that 90 percent of its revenue was still from online advertising.</p><p>Around the same time, Google's decision to take the moral high road out of China was seeming more and more like a self-isolating move. Across Silicon Valley, tech giants in search of growth were going after China's then-680 million internet users. Apple had been running an app store in China since 2010. Microsoft's search engine, Bing, had served censored search results since 2009. Even LinkedIn was there. Meanwhile, Google watched as Chinese handset manufacturers like Xiaomi sold phones that ran on an unofficial version of Android-which meant no Google Search on the homescreen, no Google app store, and no good way to make money off of millions of devices.</p><p>The problem wasn't just that Google was losing a slice of revenue here or there. For Google, these weaknesses in cloud computing and China triggered an existential dread: They meant the company was losing visibility into the way the internet was evolving and what the future would look like.</p><p>In 2015, Google embarked on a massive reorganization. Under a new parent company, Alphabet, moon shots and side projects would fall outside of Google, which would be more focused on making money. With Pichai as Google's new CEO, finding a new footing in China and cloud computing were among the company's priorities. One of Pichai's first moves, for instance, was to hire Diane Greene, a cofounder of VMware, a company that helped popularize an early version of cloud computing before the dotcom bust. Greene would head Google's cloud division. But catching up with Bezos was going to require Google to reorient. Buyers wanted dependability, not wizardry-and they wanted someone in Mountain View to pick up the phone. And to make up for lost time, Greene would need to go after some big clients.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IV.</emphasis></p><p>On August 11, 2017-the day after pandemonium at the googleplex had prompted Pichai to cancel the town hall to discuss Damore-Google's executives entertained an unlikely visitor: secretary of defense James Mattis. At headquarters, they met the retired general across a stately conference table, with Brin, Pichai, Greene, and Walker on one side and Mattis' crew on the other, all situated in the latest-model Aeron chairs in a new shade called \"Mineral.\"</p><p>Mattis was there to talk business. The Pentagon was in the process of rekindling its relationship with Silicon Valley, which had grown up out of military contract work in the 1950s and '60s. The rise of artificial intelligence made a potential relationship once again seem mutually beneficial. In recent years, partly at the urging of tech executives like Schmidt, the Pentagon had begun pursuing contracts to modernize its digital infrastructure. But before the Pentagon could fully partake in AI and machine learning, the department had to label its stockpiles of data and move it to the cloud.</p><p>At the time of Mattis' visit, Google was reportedly in the process of bidding for a project that would jump-start this transition. It was called the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, otherwise known as Project Maven. The project would involve labeling past drone footage to train a computer vision algorithm so that, once everything was in the cloud, new drone footage could be analyzed automatically. Though it was a relatively small contract, Maven represented an important potential prize for Google. Greene had recently boasted that Google Cloud, which according to analysts had 5 percent market share at the time, could be bigger than Amazon by 2022. Federal contracts offered a quick way to get there. Maven could put Google on the fast track to receive the security clearances it needed to win more lucrative defense and intelligence agency contracts, like Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), a massive Pentagon cloud contract that was worth some $10 billion-if any cunning competitor could wrestle it away from Bezos.</p><p>Google, Amazon, and IBM were all in the running for the Maven contract. But Google was an especially furtive competitor. The company quietly put in a bid via a contractor, and it prohibited the Pentagon from mentioning Google without prior approval. As Google seemed to close in on winning the contract, executives from the cloud team pondered how a deal with the Pentagon-especially one that could be linked to autonomous weapons-might reflect on Google's non-evil brand. In September, a few weeks after the meeting with Mattis, they discussed spinning up some positive PR that would focus on the \"vanilla cloud technology\" aspects of the Maven contract. \"Avoid at ALL COSTS any mention or implication of AI,\" wrote Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford professor and Google Cloud's chief scientist for AI. Li had not been involved in the Maven contract, but she was concerned about the hype and confusion building around AI in the public imagination. \"Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI-if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google.\"</p><p>Li was right to be concerned about how Maven might be received, but the media was not the only group she had to worry about. When Google won the Maven contract in late September, the company opted not to say anything at all-even to its own employees. But it wasn't long before Liz Fong-Jones learned about Maven from a group of concerned engineers who had been tapped to lay some of the groundwork for it. They asked her to keep quiet until January while they tried to convince management to change course. Fong-Jones agreed and focused her attention on another fire that was quietly burning inside Google.</p><p>Fong-Jones contacted security herself. Let's catch the leaker, she said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">V.</emphasis></p><p>Just before 8 am on Monday, January 8, 2018, praetorian pr, a San Francisco firm founded by a Republican political consultant, sent an email inviting reporters to a \"major press conference\" with James Damore and his lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, who serves as the California Republican Party's national committee member and who \"often takes on controversial, high-profile cases.\"</p><p>\"You won't want to miss it,\" the email promised.</p><p>Damore sat next to Dhillon as she told a smattering of tech reporters and local news affiliates that her client had filed a class-action lawsuit against Google, alleging discrimination against white people, Asians, men, and conservatives, or any combination thereof. \"We don't normally file 100-page, 200-page complaints,\" Dhillon explained, thumbing through a heavy printout of the complaint laid out in front of her. \"I didn't think people were going to believe the outlandish nonsense, so we actually attached screenshots throughout.\"</p><p>When Damore had filed a set of documents stating an intent to sue Google in December 2017, the documents named Kevin Cernekee as a fellow plaintiff, but that complaint never materialized. In the lawsuit unveiled by Dhillon that day, Cernekee's name made no appearance. The complaint quoted from Google's warning letter to him and included details about his interactions with executives and HR as evidence that Google had discriminated against conservatives, but Cernekee's identity remained mostly invisible to the outside world. At least 169 other Google employees were not so lucky: The screenshots included in the lawsuit revealed dozens of email addresses, profile pictures, and snippets of discussion. Most had been culled from Google's internal social networks, including an anonymous message board about mental health and a mailing list for gender-nonbinary employees.</p><p>Another round of harassment quickly began. Threats poured in, calling for employees critical of Damore to be shot in the head, poisoned, blown up, stalked, doxed, sodomized with a cattle prod, and thrown off a building. As before, many of the employees who got singled out were queer and trans people of color. On forums like 4chan, employee names exposed in the lawsuit were linked to their social media accounts. The personal information of at least three employees was dug up and posted online. Another employee was the subject of a derogatory thread on an online forum called Kiwi Farms, which <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York</emphasis> magazine has called the web's biggest stalker community.</p><p>That month, Fong-Jones made another calculated exception to her usual policy of keeping dissent within the Google family. She and 14 other current employees spoke to WIRED about the \"dirty war\" that was being waged inside Google over the issue of diversity. Most news coverage of Damore's case amplified its claims that Google was cracking down on conservatives. But the employees argued that something else was going on. HR had become \"weaponized,\" they said; Googlers on both sides of the battle lines had become adept at working the refs-baiting colleagues into saying things that might violate the company's code of conduct, then going to human resources to report them. But Googlers on the right were going further, broadcasting snippets of the company's uncensored brawls to the world, and setting up their colleagues for harassment.</p><p>Google's HR department, for its part, was feeling inundated with policy violations across the spectrum. And according to Fong-Jones and her colleagues, the department was too focused on trying to appear even-handed. Employees had been reprimanded and even fired for criticizing Damore's memo using terms like \"white privilege\" and \"white boy.\" \"Promoting harmful stereotypes based on race or gender is prohibited,\" Google said in a statement about one such termination.</p><p>Soon after speaking to WIRED, Fong-Jones helped prepare a statement explaining to colleagues about why she and the others had gone to the press. She asked coworkers to sign a petition for a safer workplace, demanding better moderation of mailing lists and rules against doxing coworkers. It received 2,600 signatures. But it wasn't the only employee petition that would make waves that winter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VI.</emphasis></p><p>By February, word about Maven began to swirl outside the teams of engineers who had first alerted Fong-Jones to the project. So she decided to post about Maven on her internal Google+ page, sharing grave concerns that Google might be helping the US government carry out drone strikes, according to a copy of the post provided to WIRED by another Google engineer. Shortly afterward, the group of engineers posted an internal statement of their own, explaining that they had been told to build an \"air gap\"-a security measure favored by the Pentagon that physically separates networks to protect sensitive data-and informing coworkers about their efforts to thwart the project.</p><p>Fong-Jones hoped to pressure Google's leaders using entirely internal channels, and at first things seemed to be working. Outraged employees began referring to the engineers as the Group of Nine, and executives felt compelled to respond. On her own Google+ page, Greene tried to assure employees that the contract was only $9 million and merely a \"proof of concept.\" Within 48 hours, however, Fong-Jones says she received a call from a journalist-Lee Fang of the Intercept-asking her for comment on her Google+ post. Someone had leaked. If word got out, she feared, management would feel backed into a corner. So Fong-Jones contacted Google's security team herself. Let's catch the leaker, she said.</p><p>Another staffer who was keeping close track of the internal rumblings about Maven was Meredith Whittaker, a program manager inside Google Cloud. In addition to her work at Google, Whittaker also helped run a New York University-affiliated research center called the AI Now Institute, which studies the ethics and social implications of artificial intelligence. On February 28, Whittaker drafted a petition for employees demanding that Pichai cancel the contract. \"Google should not be in the business of war,\" she wrote.</p><p>At TGIF that week, executives were ill-prepared for the blowback. One employee stood up and said she had left her last job because of ethical concerns around defense work. Brin told her that Google was different, because at least here she could ask questions. Whittaker's petition netted about 500 signatures that night and 1,000 the next day. It became a touchstone for a divisive, months-long internal debate, inflamed by Google's open culture.</p><p>There was no consensus on Maven inside Google's fractious workforce, which includes former Defense Department researchers, military veterans, and immigrants from countries under US drone surveillance. Even the employee group for veterans was split on the project. But Maven's opponents were organized in a way that Google hadn't really seen before. Employees fanned out into different groups. Some scoured Google's open databases, where they discovered emails that appeared to contradict Greene's statement about the size of the Pentagon contract; they also found snippets of Python code for computer-vision technology that seemed designed to track human beings and vehicles. Some churned out anti-Maven memes; others kept track of employees who were quitting over the contract. One activist group focused on fact-checking, listing every time they found evidence to contradict the company line. The list got longer and longer.</p><p>Greene responded by playing whack-a-mole-locking down mailing lists, deleting documents, or asking employees to redact Google+ posts. Longtime execs were taken aback, and even hurt, by the loss of their employees' trust, which they had come to take for granted.</p><p>In March, Gizmodo broke the Maven story to the public. Inside Google, executives urged employees to reserve judgment; Google's leaders, they said, were developing a set of AI principles that would govern its business practices and contracts like Maven. Employees should wait for those principles, which would provide the whole company with a basis for discussion.</p><p>At another time, such a gesture toward self-regulation might have sufficed. And plenty of employees were eager to change the subject. But the anti-Maven organizers had momentum on their side-and support from an outside labor organization called Tech Workers Coalition. They were also galvanized by a powerful realization: They could reliably summon the rapt attention of the media and the public, which were hungrier than ever for the vicarious thrill of watching someone-finally-hold tech companies accountable.</p><p>On April 4, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> published a story about Whittaker's petition, which by then had gathered more than 3,100 signatures. Four days later, at 10 pm on a Monday night, Whittaker received an email from Greene inviting her to participate in a four-person internal debate about Maven, to be broadcast to Google's employees from Mountain View that Wednesday.</p><p>Whittaker prepared feverishly. She called up colleagues and a friend from the Defense Department. She memorized drone kill stats and read up on defense contracting. On the day she flew out from New York for the event, Whittaker learned that the debate would take place three times during the course of the day, so that employees in other time zones could tune in.</p><p>Whittaker should have been outmatched. Greene served as the moderator, and the two pro-Maven panelists were both longtime Google veterans. But they used many of the same arguments that executives had recited in recent TGIFs. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The contract is exploratory. Maven merely uses Google's open source machine-learning software. Better to have Google working on AI than a defense contractor. Maven helps \"our\" military.</emphasis> Whittaker, building on an analysis she had been rehearsing in Google's social networks for weeks, argued that the ethical codes surrounding AI were still largely unformed and shouldn't be defined on the fly in the context of a business relationship with the Pentagon.</p><p>After the first panel, Whittaker paced back and forth in the Googleplex parking lot, calling up colleagues to ask how they would have countered her remarks. By the time the last panel ended, Whittaker's energy was zapped. She ran to her car in the pouring rain, picked up some beer and peanuts at a bodega, and went back to her hotel room. Inside Google, people often look to Memegen to gauge the mood of an unruly workforce. On the day of the town halls, most of the memes were pro-Whittaker.</p><p>On May 30, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis> published a story about Maven that included the emails Fei-Fei Li had sent to other executives about weaponized AI. At the weekly cloud team meeting two days later, according to details leaked to Gizmodo, Greene announced that Google planned not to renew the Maven contract. The backlash, she reportedly said, had been terrible for the company.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VII.</emphasis></p><p>In early June 2018, Pichai finally published the AI principles that Google had promised its employees. They included a list of four applications of AI that Google would not pursue, including weapons, technologies that gather and use information \"for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms,\" and technology \"whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.\"</p><p>Two months later, it seemed to many employees that Pichai had already broken those principles. On August 1, a blockbuster story in the Intercept reported that Google was planning to launch a new censored search engine in China. Codenamed Project Dragonfly, the engine would blacklist search terms like \"human rights\" and \"student protest,\" and would produce government-controlled results for \"air quality.\" The service would take the form of an app that Google was prepared to launch in six to nine months. Chinese officials had already seen a demo, according to the Intercept, though Google still needed government approval. The app might even help link a person's search records to their cell phone, with the information stored on servers in China. (A Google spokesperson tells WIRED that, at the time, it was \"impossible to confirm or comment on\" what the service \"might have looked like-it was too early to say.\")</p><p>Once again, an employee backlash set in. The Chinese government censorship that had so disturbed Google staffers in 2010 had only grown bolder and more sophisticated under President Xi Jinping, who was detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in internment camps and deploying the latest in surveillance technology on citizens.</p><p>The succession of scandals kept deepening the divide between execs and employee activists. More and more, the latter were questioning the social contract they had lived by. \"I went from 'Oh my god, who leaked that?' to 'Oh my god, management did what?!' \" Fong-Jones says. She started to doubt her past successes with executives. \"Perhaps the reason they were willing to listen in the first place was to give up the things that mattered less to them,\" she says.</p><p>A couple of weeks after the first Intercept story, Pichai answered some questions about Dragonfly, which he described as an \"exploratory\" program. In his telling, Dragonfly was a project that aligned with Google's principles, not one that contravened them. \"Our stated mission is to organize the world's information,\" he said. \"China is one-fifth of the world's population.\" Besides, he said, \"I genuinely do believe we have a positive impact when we engage around the world, and I don't see any reason why that would be different in China.\"</p><p>Brin also spoke at the meeting, claiming he only learned about Dragonfly because of the \"kerfuffle.\" (Former executives say this strikes them as implausible.) He also said that \"Googlers should feel broadly proud of their work, not feel that it compromises their principles.\" Then the meeting stopped abruptly. Someone was live-leaking the event to a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> reporter. An executive onstage asked the technicians running the meeting to show everyone what was happening, and a wall of screens behind Brin flashed a tweet from the reporter who was posting Brin's comments in real time.</p><p>With the Dragonfly scandal, employees were in some ways the least of Google's worries. Washington lawmakers in both parties responded in ominous terms. \"It would be very dangerous for Google if they were misrepresenting to American policymakers the extent of their involvement in China or the ramifications of some of their joint ventures,\" US senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, told WIRED, noting the growing bipartisan concern around China.</p><p>Dragonfly left Google particularly vulnerable to criticism from leaders on the right, who painted the company as un-American. Josh Hawley, now a Republican senator from Missouri, said Google was motivated more by money than allegiance to any country. \"If that means violating the privacy of American consumers, they're happy to do it. If that means going to China and partnering on technologies that aid a repressive regime, they're apparently happy to do it.\" In that context, Google's old slogan no longer applies, Hawley said. \"It's time that we remove the halo.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VIII.</emphasis></p><p>On October 25, 2018, a story in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the New York Times</emphasis> dredged up the dark side of Google's tolerance for aberrant geniuses. In 2013, the paper reported, a woman who worked for Google had accused Android cofounder Andy Rubin of coercing her to perform oral sex in a hotel room. Google, the story reported, had investigated and found the claim credible but sent Rubin off with a $90 million exit package and a fond farewell.</p><p>The story didn't stop at Rubin. Another high-performing executive, Amit Singhal, the former head of Google Search, was given a multimillion-dollar exit package after a female employee accused him of groping her at an off-site work event. A third, Richard DeVaul, allegedly told a female job candidate that he was in a polyamorous relationship during her interview and invited her to meet him at Burning Man, where he asked if he could give her a massage. Google denied her the job. DeVaul was still working at Google as director of X, the company's experimental division for ambitious projects.</p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times</emphasis> investigation also noted Google's overall \"permissive culture,\" in which top executives-including Brin, Schmidt, and chief legal officer David Drummond-had relationships with female employees. Some of the women claimed they were later pushed out of the company.</p><p>Google employees lit up the company's internal social networks, once again contemplating galling facts about the status of women in Silicon Valley. But this time the discussion was less easily derailed, perhaps because some of the most important exchanges took place on an anonymous mailing list called Expectant New Moms. The group's 4,000 members knew the stories about Rubin and Singhal-thanks in part to email threads on the list after each executive departed. But Rubin's $90 million payout felt like a sucker punch. The fact that leaders' misconduct had been an open secret made it worse. Why had they given so many years of their lives to make these men insanely rich?</p><p>At 2:05 pm, Claire Stapleton, then a product marketing manager at YouTube, fired off a message to the group: \"absolutely disgusting-all of it, all of them. topple the patriarchy.\"</p><p>That day Alphabet was already poised to share some mixed financial news. The company was set to report $9.19 billion in profits for the third quarter, thanks in part to Trump's tax cuts to benefit big business, but missed revenue targets. Now executives scrambled to do damage control with employees before the earnings call. A couple of hours after the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times</emphasis> story was published, Pichai sent a memo assuring employees that Google had reformed its ways. In the past two years, he wrote, 48 people had been terminated for sexual harassment, including 13 at the senior manager level or higher, none of whom received an exit package. Employees were skeptical. If Google was so committed to a safe environment, why was DeVaul still there? (A Google spokesperson said HR investigated the allegation \"thoroughly and took appropriate corrective action.\")</p><p>That same evening, Page-who was CEO when the claims about Rubin, Singhal, and DeVaul came to light-apologized to employees at a TGIF. \"I've had to make a lot of decisions that affect people every day, some of them not easy. And, you know, I think certainly there's ones with the benefit of hindsight I would have made differently,\" he said in a prepared statement. Page's explanation was evasive, but his tone was serious. Brin, on the other hand, made an awkward joke about confidentiality, which sounded to some as if he were blaming the leakers, and seemed irked by the fact that the same question came up over and over again when the executives had nothing new to say. The meeting soon returned to business as usual with a product demo for new Google Photo features.</p><p>For Stapleton, the meeting was a huge letdown. Her first job at Google, in 2007, had been to help lead TGIF, including writing talking points for Page and Brin. Now they couldn't even answer the main question. At 7:58 pm, Stapleton fired off another message to the list suggesting the moms channel their anger into collective action, like maybe a walkout, a strike, or an open letter. \"Googler women (and allies) are REALLY ragefueled right now, and I wonder how we can harness that to force some, like, real change.\"</p><p>As the women dissected the TGIF performance, they also swapped stories about reporting harassment to Google HR, only to watch their abusers receive promotions. The messages were still rolling in at 1 am.</p><p>The next morning, Stapleton started a Google Group. \"Welcome to ground zero of the google women's walkout / a day without women (naming/branding tbd).\" Just as with the travel ban walkout 21 months earlier, word spread quickly. A group of eight organizers emerged, including Meredith Whittaker, and they got to work planning logistics, hammering out demands, and fine-tuning their message. Stapleton set up a Google form to ask employees why they were walking out. The 350 responses that promptly poured in included personal stories about harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and pay inequity.</p><p>From those responses and other internal posts, the organizers smelted together five core demands. They wanted an end to forced arbitration, a process that compelled employees to bring their claims to a private arbiter, paid for by Google, rather than before a judge. They also demanded pay equity and policies that would guarantee more transparency around harassment claims. They scrubbed personal details from the 350 stories and divided them into buckets that mapped to each demand, so the rally organizers would have something to read.</p><p>As the plans came together, Google invited Stapleton to join a meeting with three top female executives: Ruth Porat, the company's chief financial officer; Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube; and Eileen Naughton, the head of people operations. The invitation was brokered by the head of Women at Google, an employee resource group, who told Stapleton it was an amazing opportunity. Other walkout organizers disagreed. Google was just trying to co-opt their momentum, the organizers felt. Stapleton pushed off the request. \"It feels weird to say no to these women who are, like, Illuminati,\" she said.</p><p>On Tuesday evening, two days before the walkout, Pichai sent another memo: \"One thing that's become clear to me is that our apology at TGIF didn't come through, and it wasn't enough.\" He acknowledged the protest and told employees they would have the support they needed.</p><p>The plan was for each office to walk out at 11:10 am on November 1, 2018. By the time the first images came in from Asia, it was clear that the call hadn't merely mobilized the lefties in Mountain View. In Singapore, where labor law prohibits workers from marching, employees stood in a cavernous office lobby, somber and listening intently to the speakers. In New York City, employees streamed out from Google's Eighth Avenue office into a nearby park. Whittaker and Stapleton stood on chairs as they rallied the crowd. Their megaphone was no match for the noise from the West Side Highway, but chants of \"Time's up!\" rose above the din.</p><p>When it came time for Mountain View to rally, 4,000 Google employees filled the courtyard outside the main caf\u00e9, once again chanting and holding signs, including ones designed by volunteers from Google Creative Lab that said \"HAPPY TO QUIT FOR $90M-NO SEXUAL HARASSMENT REQUIRED\" in a fresh, sans-serif font. Standing a few yards from where Pichai and Brin had stood during the travel ban walkout in 2017, employees once again shared their stories. A female YouTube employee described being drugged by a coworker at a company event, then being told by HR that she had to stay on the same team. This time, no executive stepped up to the mic. No one chanted their names.</p><p>Local TV crews had to report from the edges of campus, but the news choppers overhead had a clear view of \"Not OK, Google\" and \"Time's Up\" written in chalk on the pavement. By then, Stapleton, Whittaker, and the other organizers back in New York had commandeered a booth at a Mexican place in the Meatpacking District. They ordered margaritas and chips and guacamole, updating social media accounts and ducking outside for press interviews. The women were triumphant; they were half asleep. A few days earlier, they'd thought a turnout in the hundreds would be a big deal. When they tallied the total, 20,000 employees had walked out.</p><p>In a way, though, Google's attempts to neutralize the walkout had worked. A sense of catharsis and camaraderie seemed to overshadow any hostility toward management. Even some supporters felt that the walkout was more about the act than the asks. On November 8, 2018, a week after the protest, Pichai sent a memo to his employees-simultaneously published on Google's blog-announcing that Google would no longer require arbitration on sexual harassment claims. But it would still prohibit class actions. The change brought Google in line with policy tweaks that Microsoft, and even Uber, had made within the past year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IX.</emphasis></p><p>Google's response followed a familiar cycle: internal opposition and bad press, followed by incremental change. But the Women's Walkout appears to have perturbed executives in a way that the protests against Dragonfly and Maven had not. In the months that followed, pushback seemed to spill over into the organizers' day jobs. In December, Whittaker was told she would have to leave the Google Cloud organization, where she had worked for three years. A few weeks after that, Stapleton claims she was told that her role at YouTube would be \"restructured\" and she would lose half her reports and responsibilities. (A Google spokesperson says no changes were made to Stapleton's role.)</p><p>Fong-Jones, for her part, was burning out. It had been a long year and a half since Damore's memo leaked. In early January 2019, she submitted her resignation, but she turned even that into a last-ditch effort to reform Google; she told executives she would reconsider if the company put an employee on its corporate board. Instead, Google HR tried to get her to leave before her notice period was up, and she filed a retaliation claim. Google investigated and determined it was unfounded.</p><p>That month, Google also tightened the reins on TGIF. Brin and Page stopped showing up. Employees could access video recordings for only a week after the meeting, rather than for years. The company nixed live questions, which Google claimed was more fair to employees in different time zones. (\"We're a global company and want to make sure we're answering questions from employees around the world,\" a spokesperson says.) TGIF's transformation from candid conversation to press conference was pretty much complete.</p><p>The company's internal social networks were quieter too. Cernekee had been fired in June 2018 for violating multiple company policies, including using a personal device to download company information. As part of his ongoing legal case, according to people familiar with the matter, he had to give back 20,000 pages of internal documents, some of them confidential. (Cernekee disputes this.) Damore's class-action lawsuit was also proceeding, albeit without Damore. In October 2018 his claims were moved to arbitration, while claims from two conservatives who allege they were denied positions for political reasons are proceeding in court.</p><p>A couple of months later, Pichai was called up to answer questions about Dragonfly at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. \"Right now,\" he said, \"there are no plans for us to launch a search product in China.\" That wouldn't be his last trip to Washington. After two years of employee revolts, culture-warring, and accusations, the furor that had surrounded Facebook for the previous three years now finally seemed to be aimed at Google with full force. Within a three-week span in March, Senator Hawley banged the drum on amending laws that granted platforms immunity from liability for moderating their platforms; Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren published a plan to break up Big Tech; and the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified that Google's effort to court China \"indirectly benefits the Chinese military,\" even as it snubbed working with the Pentagon. A couple of days later, President Trump tweeted, \"Google is helping China and their military, but not the U.S. Terrible!\"</p><p>That spring, many of Google's efforts to stave off scrutiny seemed to hasten its arrival. In March, Google announced that it had formed an AI ethics council composed of external advisers. It included Kay Coles James, president of the Heritage Foundation, who lacked any discernible expertise in artificial intelligence and who had recently expressed anti-trans and anti-immigrant views. Some employees were appalled; an internal petition to remove James quickly gained 2,500 signatures. Breitbart and the Daily Caller posted the names of petition organizers, including Whittaker, and leaked internal messages from a mailing list. One ethics council member quit in the midst of the uproar. When Google learned that another member was planning on defecting, the company disbanded the council-nine days after it launched. To the outside world, it looked as if Google had capitulated to employee protests. Conservative critics descended. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis>, James said Google was not upholding its bargain with the right. \"How can Google now expect conservatives to defend it against anti-business policies from the left that might threaten its very existence?\" she asked.</p><p>While Whittaker was helping to lead the charge against the ethics council, she continued to tussle with management over her job. Stapleton, who had been told multiple times that she was a \"rising leader\" in YouTube marketing, says she was also struggling to hold on to the responsibilities she'd held before the walkout. When the two women heard that a third organizer had also been denied a transfer, they posted an open letter on the walkout mailing list on a Monday in late April, reporting to their coworkers that Google was retaliating against them. They invited their colleagues to fight back against retaliation at an employee town hall meeting that Friday, to be livestreamed at Google offices around the globe.</p><p>That week, managers emailed the entire marketing and cloud departments, denying the women's claims. On the morning of the town hall, Lorraine Twohill, the head of marketing at Google, also sent a department-wide email saying Stapleton's claims were false. \"Over the last several weeks, I have spent a lot of time talking to everyone involved, trying to understand and empathize with the situation,\" she wrote. Stapleton says Twohill never asked her about the incidents surrounding her claims of retaliation.</p><p>After that, Stapleton saw no future for herself at YouTube. She handed in her resignation three weeks later. In mid-July, Whittaker resigned too. The next day Google happened to announce definitively that Project Dragonfly was dead. By then, none of the major organizers of the protests that had shaken Google over the past two years were left at the company.</p><p>But that didn't mean things would go back to normal at Google. Over the past three years, the structures that once allowed executives and internal activists to hash out tensions had badly eroded. In their place was a new machinery that the company's activists on the left had built up, one that skillfully leveraged media attention and drew on traditional organizing tactics. Dissent was no longer a family affair. And on the right, meanwhile, the pipeline of leaks running through Google's walls was still going as strong as ever.</p><p>Late this June, Project Veritas, a right-wing outlet specializing in stings and expos\u00e9s, published a slew of leaked documents and snippets of hidden-camera footage from inside Google. One of the items it posted, as if evidence of Google's supposed bias, was a \"Beginner's Guide to Protesting\" that Google employees had drawn up around the time of the travel ban walkout back in 2017. Next to the document was a message and a link. \"Do you work in Big Tech?\" it said. \"Project Veritas would love to hear from you.\"</p><h>CAST OF CHARACTERS</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BY ZAK JASON</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SUNDAR PICHAI</emphasis></p><p>Google's CEO for the past four years.

A party that once stood for free trade has a president who loves tariffs. A party that championed free enterprise has a president out to punish companies he doesn't like. A party that stood for the rule of law has a president who attacks his own Justice Department.</p><p>And now this. A party that has long preached limited government, free expression and deregulation now has an administration pondering a politically motivated investigation of social media intended to justify a new wave of regulations.</p><p>Without question, social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as well as Google, the web's dominant search engine, have amassed great power in recent years and have had an almost unimaginable impact on politics and culture.</p><p>Facebook, a company founded in a dorm room 14 years ago, has recently been hiring linguists, programmers and artificial intelligence experts all around the world to keep its platform from becoming a medium of violence and spreader of lies.</p><p>Facebook is being used as a propaganda vehicle for both sides in a Libyan civil war and has been accused of aiding the cause of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Closer to home, it was used by the Russian government to spread misinformation leading up to the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Twitter has long been the social media weapon of choice for conspiracy theorists and provocateurs such as Alex Jones. Jones is peddler of lies, most notably that the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 was a hoax. He also likes to wrap himself in constitutionalism, arguing that his First Amendment right to peddle sickening fantasies requires tech companies to provide an audience.</p><p>One by one, social media companies have come to the conclusion that they have no obligation to amplify his voice and that, as a matter of pure self-interest, they should not. On Thursday, Twitter became the last major company to ban or greatly limit him from its platform.</p><p>Enter Big Government: GOP edition.</p><p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last week that he would convene a meeting with states to discuss ways that social media companies stifle free expression. This comes after some Republican members of Congress and the president complained that tech companies were stifling conservative voices.</p><p>We can think of nothing more repulsive to the values of the Constitution, or antithetical to Republican beliefs, than a government inquiry into the role of media in disseminating speech.</p><p>Do social media companies stifle some legitimate speech? Almost certainly they do. But if people have a beef with that, they should take it up with the various companies, not run to the government.</p><p>What they will find is that such tech companies restrict speech in a limited number of instances to protect the quality of their product, and thus to make more money.

A party that has long preached limited government, free expression and deregulation now has an administration pondering a politically motivated investigation of social media intended to justify a new wave of regulations.</p><p>Without question, social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as well as Google, the web's dominant search engine, have amassed great power in recent years and have had an almost unimaginable impact on politics and culture.</p><p>Facebook, a company founded in a dorm room 14 years ago, has recently been hiring linguists, programmers and artificial intelligence experts all around the world to keep its platform from becoming a medium of violence and spreader of lies.</p><p>Facebook is being used as a propaganda vehicle for both sides in a Libyan civil war and has been accused of aiding the cause of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Closer to home, it was used by the Russian government to spread misinformation leading up to the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Twitter has long been the social media weapon of choice for conspiracy theorists and provocateurs such as Alex Jones. Jones is peddler of lies, most notably that the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 was a hoax. He also likes to wrap himself in constitutionalism, arguing that his First Amendment right to peddle sickening fantasies requires tech companies to provide an audience.</p><p>One by one, social media companies have come to the conclusion that they have no obligation to amplify his voice and that, as a matter of pure self-interest, they should not. On Thursday, Twitter became the last major company to ban or greatly limit him from its platform.</p><p>Enter Big Government: GOP edition.</p><p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last week that he would convene a meeting with states to discuss ways that social media companies stifle free expression. This comes after some Republican members of Congress and the president complained that tech companies were stifling conservative voices.</p><p>We can think of nothing more repulsive to the values of the Constitution, or antithetical to Republican beliefs, than a government inquiry into the role of media in disseminating speech.</p><p>Do social media companies stifle some legitimate speech? Almost certainly they do. But if people have a beef with that, they should take it up with the various companies, not run to the government.</p><p>What they will find is that such tech companies restrict speech in a limited number of instances to protect the quality of their product, and thus to make more money. They don't want to be a garbage bucket of falsehoods or megaphone of hate speech because that would drive away their customers.</p><p>Social media companies are money-grubbing capitalists out to make a buck.

Here is the full transcript and audio recording of our conversation. - Fred Hiatt, editorial page editor          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Click on a highlight to jump ahead in the transcript below.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Fred Hiatt, editorial page editor: Thank you for coming. We'd like to ask you questions and then post a transcript of the conversation. I thought I'd start by asking about human-centered capitalism, which I think I understand the principles, but I'm less clear on the means to get there. I know you want to measure different things, which might provide different incentives. You want to pay regulators more to even the field. But beyond that, how do you get this major transition to happen?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: There is a saying in business that you make what you measure, and that's not just in business. That's in all organizations, and that's human nature. We have a fixation on numbers and goals. And right now, the primary goals we set as an economy and society are oriented around stock market prices, [gross domestic product] and, to some extent, the headline unemployment rate. Those three measures are leading us in very distinct directions that have less and less relationship with how the average American is doing.</p><p>And one of the things I say on the trail is that corporate profits are at record highs, but also at record highs in the U.S.: stress, anxiety, financial insecurity, student loan indebtedness, mental illness, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, and that life expectancy has declined for the last three years. So if your corporate profits are going up and your life expectancy is going down, which do you listen to as a society? So step one is to get the measurements right. Instead of trying to use these crude economic measurements as proxies for our well-being, we should just measure our well-being. So what is our well-being? Health and life expectancy, mental health and freedom from substance abuse, childhood success rates, proportion of Americans who can retire in quality circumstances, environmental sustainability. You could even have variables like civic engagement and artistic and cultural dynamism.</p><p>So to your question, first you have measurements for these things, and I would suggest that just having these be a primary element of how we pay attention to our own health and progress would be game changing, because right now the messages that Americans get are that things are great. You can tell because the stock market's setting new highs and these numbers look very positive and rosy. But then Americans sense that those numbers don't correspond to how their communities are doing. They're seeing that eight Americans are dying of drug overdoses every hour, that their kids are addicted to either smartphones or drugs. And so that disconnect is causing massive, massive problems.</p><p>If you actually showed the people that we know that we're in the midst of a mental health crisis, a wellness recession, a civic engagement depression, that would be alone a massive step forward. And also, if you have these measurements, then many, many organizations would naturally try to remedy them. So nonprofits and local governments would look and say, \"Wow, it's incredible that our social measurements are declining this precipitously. We need to do something about it.\"</p><p>Now, to your question, how do we actually move things in that direction? This is where, first, your tax system comes in. So right now, we have a relatively crude way to reward charitable contributions, which is we say, \"Hey, they're tax deductible.\" For most businesses, this is helpful. But just about anything they spend money on is \"tax deductible\" because it's going to reduce their earnings by a certain amount. So we need to do more to say, look, if you can actually discernibly improve, let's say, graduation rates in a particular town or area or physical wellness of, let's call it hundreds and thousands of employees, then not only do you get a tax break for having put money into that, but you might even get something positive in addition, for the fact that you actually have improved our society's measurements on the things that we care about.</p><p>If we persist on following GDP, we're going to follow it off a cliff because things like artificial intelligence and self-driving trucks will be tremendous for both GDP and corporate profits, and they will be very problematic, even disastrous for many, many Americans. If you can imagine a business or organization that is following the wrong measurements, that is the United States of America right now. Human-centered capitalism actually shows us how we are doing, and then we'll put our country's energies towards improving our lives rather than the bottom lines of a smaller and smaller handful of companies.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: So, just to follow up on step two, essentially you're using tax expenditures to reward companies that improve education or health ...</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Or nonprofits or entrepreneurs.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: Rather than have the government have policies that improve education or health.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Of course, the government should be enacting those policies at every turn.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: Isn't that going make the tax system fairly complicated, more complicated?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Well, one could argue that right now we have a lot of complication without a lot of the positive value you'd hope to generate from that complication.</p><p>So actually, let me continue for a second.</p><p>So the goal of government should be to improve these measurements at every turn. That's another reason why having them as the core measurements of our economy is so important. Because right now, if you have these surges in deaths of despair, which you do in much of the country, that should be a red flag for us all, particularly for government. What's happening right now is that Americans fear that our government is essentially not accountable to the success or failure of our people. So if you were, let's say, a state government in Ohio and then you saw these epic surges in opiate deaths to the point that your morgues can't actually accommodate the bodies and they're storing them at local funeral homes. The government looks up at this and says, well, this is a major problem, and then it tries to do something about it. But the people don't feel like anything happens to the government, whether the opiate deaths continue or get better.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: So in a way, it sounds like you want to put dollars behind what the Business Roundtable just talked about of corporate responsibility and not just focusing on profits. They got some pushback from people who said, \"If you're a steel company, what you do best is make steel efficiently and reward your employees fairly for doing that. You're not an expert in graduation rates.\" And so in a democracy, rather than ask the steel company or the test prep [company] each to come up with their own solutions, we ought to tax those companies and then work on graduation rates through the government. But you think that's wrong?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Well, so before I decided to run for president, I spent seven years running a national nonprofit that I founded called Venture for America. And we did a lot of good, still doing a lot of good today. The organization has grown and prospered after I stepped down. But I saw the limits of what's happening in both government and philanthropy in many respects. It's why the flagship proposal of my campaign is to put $1,000 a month into the hands of every American adult. This would improve graduation rates, health and nutrition, mental health and stress levels, rates of business formation, domestic violence rates. It would decrease hospital visits. Because if you put the resources into the hands of a nonprofit like myself, and I'm very, very proud of all the work that we've done, you have the feeling that you're still just scratching the surface of the problem you're trying to address. Where my organization has helped create about 3,500 jobs and counting over the last number of years. We were honored by the Obama administration multiple times. And I've been to those communities now for seven years. And I've recognized that my work was like pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. The rate of change right now in our society is faster than ever. Technology is transforming our way of life fundamentally. Amazon alone is closing 30 percent of America's stores in malls, reducing the most common job in our economy, which is retail clerk. And the average retail clerk is a 39-year-old woman making between $8 and $12 an hour.</p><p>What is her next role when the store or mall closes? Now, one theory of the case would be, well, we should get tax revenue and then do something about that. But of course, Amazon, your corporate parent, paid zero in federal taxes last year.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: Can I just say, not our corporate parent. Amazon doesn't own The Washington Post. [Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Post.]</p><p>             Andrew Yang: You are correct. I apologize.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: That's okay.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: So Amazon, the trillion-dollar tech company, pays zero in taxes, which sort of weakens this case that, hey, we'll get tax revenue and then make use of it. And the question is, even if the government did have revenue, what would it do for that woman to improve her lot? Right now, that's a very open question. What is the government doing about the fact that 30 percent of our country's stores in malls are closing for good? What is the government doing about the fact that robot trucks are just now starting to hit the highways and driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states? And the answer is the government is doing nothing because our government is decades behind the curve. Everyone knows that. They got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995. So they've literally been flying blind on technology-related issues for 25 years and counting. The American people know this. So they look up and say, \"How are we going to actually solve these problems on the ground?\" That is the open question. That is why Donald Trump is our president today, is because Americans have been unsatisfied with the answer.</p><p>             Charles Lane, editorial writer: So if I could, I'd like to ask a few things about the basic income or the Freedom Dividend proposal. Starting with the premise, which is that technology is about to sort of so destabilize the job market, wipe out all these jobs, that you're gonna have to have that. I mean, I'm not an expert on trucking, but I spent last night reading about three hours about the future of autonomous trucking. And it frankly just seems a lot, lot more of a long-range problem than you're describing. I mean, I'm only zeroing in on that because you've emphasized the fact that it's where not college people get their jobs. And quite apart from doing nothing about it, government is deeply involved as the regulator of transportation. And until the Congress signs off on those trucks, they're not going to hit the road. So I'd like to hear you talk a little bit more about why you're so sure that this sort of displacement is not going to work the way it has in the past. For example, even the retail clerks who are being technologically unemployed by Amazon, may now be working in one of Amazon's warehouses, just to cite a for-instance. So be a little more specific about why that long-range phenomenon, whereby technological unemployment kind of corrects itself, is not going to happen.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: I'm 100 percent confident because of both what I saw over the last number of years in the markets that have been hit by the automation of manufacturing jobs and the numbers on the ground throughout the country. So first, what many people cite is they say, \"Hey, the United States of America has been through this before with the Industrial Revolution.\" What they don't seem to remember is that the Industrial Revolution, at the turn of the 20th century, included mass riots that killed dozens of Americans, caused the equivalent of billions of dollars worth of damage, led to the origination of labor unions that fought for worker rights, Labor Day as a national holiday and the implementation of universal high school in 1911, in part to try to educate a population that was struggling with the transition. And that our best experts in the field, McKinsey, MIT, the Obama White House, all say that this fourth industrial revolution will affect two to three times the number of workers on an annual basis than that one did. So even if you were to use history as your template, you'd expect there to be massive problems during this time.          </p><p>The second thing is studying what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers who lost their jobs primarily in the Midwest over the last number of years. During that time, you did not see those workers get retrained for new jobs. You saw almost half of them drop out of the workforce, and of that group, almost half filed for disability. So there was not the retraining that you hope would occur. And this is with an industry where we actually saw it coming, where we actually had industry-oriented retraining programs that were an abysmal failure. It's irresponsible for a politician to talk about turning coal miners into coders because they will then leave and they will never have to actually train thousands of coal miners to become coders or employ those coders. The retraining programs by the numbers are more of a fantasy than a policy. If right now, in this time of historic change, our labor market were reorganizing, you would not see multidecade and record low levels of business formation among young people, interstate migration or other forms of entrepreneurship going off a cliff.</p><p>             We talk about the Internet as if it's very, very good for entrepreneurs. It's very, very good for people who want to sell their time for less than subsistence wages online.          </p><p>A couple of generations ago, the entrepreneurship that would have occurred in a community would have been things like a flower shop, a hardware store, a toy store. Now, none of those businesses make any sense because the Internet has taken those costs down and the opportunities away.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: So why is giving everybody  $12,000 a year a game-changer in this picture?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: So if you imagine a town of 10,000 adults in Missouri and they're struggling. And then after I'm president in 2021, and Congress says let's pass the Freedom Dividend, then the following year they're getting an additional $10 million a month in buying power in that community. Where does the money go? It primarily goes to local businesses, car repairs they've been putting off, day-care expenses ...</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: So hardware store and flower stores become relevant again?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: ... Nonprofits, religious organizations, arts and culture. It goes towards the things that actually make that community function in a healthy way. And it may not be that the hardware store reopens, but you wind up with things like yoga studios and learning centers and things that don't necessarily easily disappear to the cloud. This is one reason why I want to try and repurpose many of the stores and malls that are now closing, because when retail districts close or, in particular, when a mall closes, it causes urban blight for blocks and blocks around. So we have to do our best to try and shift many of these structures to some new productive use that will look different than the use that came before. But if we fail in this, then these communities will likely never recover.</p><p>             Charles Lane: So I wanted to ask, because it's not just the $10,000 or, sorry, the $12,000 a year or $24,000 for a couple, it's the pay-for of that and also the terms and conditions. So I've looked at various estimates of how this would end up getting paid for. And I have to tell you, most of the estimates I've read suggests that your pay-fors are going to fall well short of the $2.8 trillion a year that it would cost to do that. So that's one question about it.</p><p>And second is that the fact that, you know, when we talk about this $12,000 a year, that's $12,000 that Ivanka Trump and $12,000 that Jared Kushner are going to get. The idea that this is not focused on the people who are actually bearing the brunt of all the changes you're talking about, I think, is a real puzzle for a lot of people. And I'd like to hear you discuss why that isn't a defect in this plan.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: So Alaska, which has had this dividend in effect for almost 40 years, where now everyone in the state gets between $1,000 and $2,000 a year in oil money, passed this and said everyone is going to get it from the richest Alaskan to the poorest. And there are many, many benefits to this. There is no stigma attached to it. There's no need to report your income or any changes in your circumstances. It's not that I'm paying for it, and you're getting it. And it's universally popular. So here in the U.S., if we say everyone gets a $1,000 a month as a right of citizenship, then that's something that everyone can get excited about immediately.</p><p>Now, there are several reasons why I'm not worried about the Ivanka Trumps of the world. As you likely know, I want to pay for this through a value-added tax that would fall most heavily on the big winners of the 21st century. So someone like Ivanka would end up paying hundreds of thousands of dollars into the system. And so if we try and send her $1,000 a month to remind her she's an American, it's immaterial in the scheme of things. And the benefits towards making it universal are much, much higher than if we have to try and ascertain whether these people truly live together, like whether they got a fake divorce so that one of them could report zero incomes, so they could get an extra $1,000 a year. All of the administrative issues essentially disappear, and this becomes something that we can all get behind as owners and shareholders of the richest, most advanced economy in the history of the world.</p><p>Do you want me to talk about the pay-for?</p><p>             Charles Lane: Yes.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: So the pay-for, right now, if you have the Amazons and Netflixes of the world paying literally zero in taxes, and then the other big winners like Apple, Google, Microsoft, parking tens, hundreds of billions of dollars in profits overseas because they want to avoid paying taxes here in the U.S., then you have a consistent revenue problem that is just going to rise over time. And one of the examples I use, let's say a company comes up with artificial intelligence software that displaces most of the 2\u00bd million Americans who work in call centers right now, making between $10 and $14 an hour. How much tax revenue will we see from the AI company? And the answer is probably nothing or next to nothing, because the AI company will have been bought by Amazon or Google, who will then park the revenue someplace else or not pay anything in taxes. Meanwhile, all of those 2\u00bd million call center workers right now do pay taxes. And so we're going to have this growing revenue problem over time as software and technology do more of the work.</p><p>If you want to put it in the simplest terms, robots don't pay taxes. And so if you have more and more work being done by machines, technology, software and artificial intelligence over time, you are in a bit of a bind.</p><p>Other countries have looked at this and said you can't have trillion-dollar tech companies like Amazon paying zero in taxes. So they have a value-added tax at the point of sale. It's very hard to game your way out of, generates significant revenue from the people that are winning the most, and one tremendous thing about the value-added tax is you can scale it up on things like AI and yachts and luxury watches, and then exempt it or reduce it on diapers, milk, toilet paper and things that everyday Americans consume. Conservatively, an effective value-added tax at even half the European level generates almost a trillion dollars in revenue with a giant up arrow attached to it because that level is going to increase over time. That's a huge down payment on this $1,000 a month for each of us.</p><p>After we get the $1,000 a month, if we manage to sneak into Jeff Bezos's bank account and give him $1,000 a month, what impact would that have on the U.S. economy? Zero. He wouldn't even know. No one would know. It just be like a digit changed. If you put $1,000 a month in the hands of one of the 78 percent of Americans who's living paycheck to paycheck or the 50 percent-plus who can't afford an unexpected $500 bill, what is that impact on the economy? We know they're going to spend virtually all of it, and they're going to spend most of it where they live. And that money is not going to stay just in that one transaction. It's going to circulate over and over again.</p><p>When you look at the pay-for on this, people are underestimating the second order, economic benefits of having this money flow through the economy. You would get back hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue from the new economic growth, from the trickle-up economy, because people would be spending more and more persistently. You'd also save billions on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency-room health care that we spend tens, hundreds of billions on right now. It was a corrections officer in New Hampshire who said to me, we should pay people to stay out of jail because we spend so much when they're in jail. We think we're saving money by not investing in people, but we end up spending more in more expensive and punitive ways when they hit our institutions. And the last thing is that if you put this money into our hands, it increases our GDP by $700 billion a year, just by better health and education outcomes. And this is not taking into account the massive catalyst to entrepreneurship, creativity, risk taking, and new businesses and nonprofits that would form if people did not feel like they were going to starve to death if something did not work out.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: Let's move on. We asked readers to send in questions.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: And how much of them were about $1,000 a month?</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: Actually, the range of reader questions we got for you was kind of amazing, and a lot of smart questions. So let me ask one and then maybe Molly can go next. Sue from Oakland, Calif., to ask a very specific one, says: \"Adjunct professors teach 70 percent of the classes at college but only make a fraction of what tenured professors are paid. Most don't receive health insurance, and there's no realistic pathway to a permanent full-time job. What would you do to help them?\"</p><p>             Andrew Yang: She's right. And what's happened to adjunct professors is morally bankrupt. You have these universities that have figured out that they have this pool of labor that they can systematically exploit. In the old days, they would feel like they had to put someone on a tenure track in order to teach for the long term. But now they've figured out that there's an oversupply of PhDs and they can get away with pushing them around. I am for the rights to organize among these adjunct professors. I know some of them have pushed for it. We need to see that they are treated better. But I want to speak to what that is emblematic of.</p><p>So we have universities that have gone up two and a half times in cost over the last number of years. Have they improved two and a half times in quality? No. But everyday Americans look up and say, oh my gosh.</p><p>How many of you all are parents like me? So if you're a parent and you're looking up saying \"what, college costs what a year?\" You know, we're looking at what, if you have two kids, you're looking at half a million dollars in tuition for many of these schools. And parents feel like they have no choice but to pay. So then what does the government do? The government says we'll give you loans. So you're up to $1.6 trillion dollars in student loan debt and counting. And the underemployment rate for recent college graduates is 40 to 44 percent.</p><p>So if you are a college, again what is your accountability? If you raise prices, what happens? Well, it's tougher on families, but they'll just get the loans from the government. It's tougher on your graduates. But you know, at that point, they're out of your hair. And so what are your incentives as a university to try and keep your costs under control? Not very high. What are your incentives to treat your adjunct professor like a human being? Vanishingly low because you've got an ever-replenishing pool of people who want to do that job because many Americans have dreamt about being a professor. And if you're a university, then theoretically you can do no wrong because you're a nonprofit and no one's going to come to you and say, hey, some of these practices are really bad for their country.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: So your solution is?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: No. 1, you say to the universities, \"Hey, let's try and get your administrator-to-student ratio down to what it was in the 1990s, because the main reason your costs have gone up 250 percent are that your administrator-to-student ratio has gone up 150 percent. You are not spending the money on faculty. You're not spending the money on things that are actually going to impact the educational experience. You become these overgrown, complex bureaucracies where you have many, many non-faculty administrators doing jobs that did not even exist a couple of decades ago.</p><p>\"So you get a lot of money from the government in various ways. You enjoy tax exempt status from the government. So we are going to now hold your feet to the fire and say you have to get your ratios down. Not going to do it all at once, but get your ratios down over this period of time.\" The universities will say, \"This is impossible. We can't do it.\" And then you'll look at them and say, \"Well, I think you'll figure it out.\" And as they do figure it out, we will realize that a significant proportion of these administrators have zero impact on the student experience. Students will not even notice that they're gone and that these schools just needed someone to actually hold them accountable for annual price increases.</p><p>And this is not just schools - like, health insurance companies. Every year, what's their business model? It's just jack up the prices a little bit. There are three core sources of inflation in American life that are driving us all miserable: housing, education and health care. Now, unfortunately, those three are like the pillars of American life and a middle-class existence. So if your wages and compensation stay essentially the same, but then I jack up the price of college every year and I jack up the price of your health insurance every year, then you become increasingly unhappy and miserable. That's what's happening with the American people right now. And this is again, a space where the government looks up and is like, well, I guess it's appropriate that we're charging this much or you're charging this much because you're the boss.</p><p>And at some point, the government has to say, wait a minute, this is all functioning as a massive system of taxation on our people. And that's not right. These organizations have to actually start trying to keep the public good in mind and not just their own growth. So this is all a long-winded way of saying we need to treat adjunct professors better because these universities will not do it themselves.</p><p>             Molly Roberts, editorial writer: Great. You've mentioned the Amazons and Netflixes of the world a lot. I keep thinking if I got a thousand dollars a month, why wouldn't I just go and spend it on Amazon? Is there anything besides taxing these big companies more that we need to do? Do we need to, as a lot of other candidates have said, break up Big Tech?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: There has been excessive consolidation in the technology industry, and it's bad for us on many levels. We should be forcing some of these technology companies to divest parts of themselves. We should also be prohibiting them from acquiring certain types of businesses, because right now in Silicon Valley, the business model is not to build the next great company. The business model is to get gobbled up by one of the behemoths for a billion dollars and then everyone's rich and goes home, and it doesn't really matter what they did to your technology. That said, breaking up Amazon, as an example, would not magically revive the main streets of Indiana. And there are many fields in technology where there will actually be one or maybe two winners. And the example I used at one of the debates was, no one wants to use Bing today or no one wants to use the fourth-best navigation app. We all just want to use the one that has the best information on it. And so saying we're going to keep breaking you up anytime one of you wins does not make sense in some of these contexts.</p><p>It also does not solve some of the biggest problems that we're actually seeing in tech. So, again, if you are a parent, you are concerned that your kid's brain is being rewired by screens and smartphone use. They are being rewired. We've seen record high levels of anxiety and depression that are in lockstep with increased adoption of smartphones and social media apps. You know who don't let their kids use screens? The people in Silicon Valley. If you go there, you will see there are no screens in sight in these households because they know what they're doing. Tristan Harris said we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for teenagers.</p><p>So the question is, how do we get into the guts of these tech companies and protect our kids from having their brains changed in ways that are quite negative? If you were to go around saying \"break up Big Tech, break up Big Tech,\" that actually does not change the mechanics of the social media app. You have to have a Department of the Attention Economy with very smart people like Tristan who go in and actually say, \"Look, here are the 20 design decisions you made. You're going to make them all differently.\" So saying you're going to go around breaking up Big Tech is a pretend solution. It's a 20th-century solution to 21st-century problems. If you home in on the actual problems you're trying to solve, you see you need a different approach. You need a scalpel, not a sledgehammer in many of these cases.</p><p>             Molly Roberts: I have a few questions about getting into the guts of those Internet harms or device harms, starting with privacy, for which I think you've proposed what people call data ownership.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Yes.</p><p>             Molly Roberts: So I think some would say maybe that the problem that we have with privacy is privacy being treated as a commodity in the first place rather than as some sort of right that you can't trade away. I guess I'd like to hear a little more about what data ownership actually looks like and how it addresses the harms we see of people looking at these confusing terms of service, giving their \"consent\" and then really having no idea what's going on.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: I love the way you frame this, Molly, because I've never met a human who actually reads those things and then walks away and says, \"I didn't like that particular turn of phrase. I'm not going to consent to this.\" I mean, it is fake consent. You're just looking at and saying, \"All right, get out of my way. I'm going to click on it and then hope you don't do anything too bad with my data,\" because the bargaining power is so extremely one-sided. I mean, you have quasi-monopolies in these tech fields where you feel like what are you going to do, not use Facebook? I mean, like, is that like a real option? Like what is the alternative if you want to keep in touch with your neighbors and college classmates?</p><p>So the way that I would turn this around is I would say, look, we're allowed, of course, to loan our data to these technology companies and we're not going to make every American a contract expert or privacy expert, but we're going to put the power in your hands and say if you loan your data to these companies, then here's what you know will happen. No. 1, there is an audit trail where you will know what they did with your data, particularly if they sold it or resold it. No. 2, if they get money for your data, you get some too. It just gets slipped into your account like on a monthly basis, and then you'll feel better about the fact that it's getting sold and resold. No. 3, you are allowed to turn it off anytime you want. You can walk away and have the right of anonymity and say, \"Hey, my data no longer appears if I don't want it to.\"</p><p>Now, the way this would work out for 98 percent of Americans is they would still just click that box, go use the app, they would never look at the audit trail, but they would feel some degree of comfort that it exists, and they would get money. So that would be a dramatic improvement. And from the government's point of view, it would be a dramatic improvement to have the audit trail, because then you can look at it and say, okay, I now know what these companies are doing with our our data, which right now we don't. Right now we just hope for the best. I go to Americans around the country and I say, \"Hey, how many of you actually change your password after you get notified that your company has been hacked,\" and only half of people do. You know, it's like they're too busy to worry about the fact that Yahoo! got hacked and their password might have been compromised. So right now, the inequities are ridiculously one-sided. I would put the power back into American's hands, but I think most Americans are creatures of convenience. We just want to know that our information is not being abused and exploited.</p><p>             Molly Roberts: And you don't think that there's any role for government to say, \"Hey, here are ways that information is abused and is exploited. Let's outlaw it.\" So that Americans who are kind of currently drowning in the control they have but don't know how to exercise over their data are protected anyway.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Yes, the government should put the power in the hands of the consumers. And what I would want is for a consumer to at some point essentially just have one choice. It's like, do you want your data use and protection to be like low, medium or high? And you can change that election at a particular point. And then the tech companies treat you differently based upon which dial you put it to, and you get a different amount of money. So if you put it to high, it's like you can aggressively use my data to some extent and I'll get more money. And then low is like then you have to anonymize it, like you can't really use it for a lot of things, and I get next to no money. So at least then Americans have a basic sense as to what their preference is and how it's expressed, like how the company actually adjusts.</p><p>             Lee Hockstader, editorial writer: To ask you about immigration: The percentage of Americans who were born somewhere else is almost 14 percent today. It's the highest in a century. It's triple what it was the 1970s. And we would argue and, from what I've seen, you would certainly argue, those immigrants have made the United States a more vibrant place, more dynamic place, culturally and economically, in many ways. But certainly there's also been a contribution to social divisions and those have been exploited by the president, among others. So what percentage, is there a percentage of immigrants as a percentage of foreign-born residents in United States that's too high? If it's 14 percent today or almost 14 percent, is 15 percent a problem? Is 20 percent a problem? At what point, is there a breaking point in terms of the number of Americans or residents who were born elsewhere?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: I'm the son of immigrants myself, so I agree that immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic economically, culturally, socially. That said, I think we should have a rational, principled approach to immigration. At the high end, we should be stapling a green card to the diploma of any student who comes here and studies at one of our universities and graduates. Because a lot of them want to stay here, and we should be encouraging them to stay here and make it easier for them to start a business, start a family, have a life here. We should try to provide a path to citizenship for the 12 million-plus people who are here and undocumented and bring them in to our society. Essentially, you have another legal classification on this path.</p><p>I think it'd be wrong to set like a numerical goal and say, well, you know, you can't have foreign-born Americans above this threshold, because, in my mind, of these people you're describing, they're all going to have kids like me and my brother, probably like immediately, not immediately. But, you know, like the next generation, like all of a sudden, they're born in this country, like and then they're, in my mind, as American as anyone else. So we should have goals that we're trying to achieve with immigration. But I don't think that there is like a numerical target we should be setting either positively or negatively.</p><p>             Lee Hockstader: So then how do you manage these tensions that have clearly arisen in society, partly from the level of immigration that's gone up so much in 40 years?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Well, it's gone up for a host of reasons. And a lot of that has been illegal immigration across the border. And so we need to enforce our borders in a real way. It's one of the reasons, one of the multitude of reasons why Americans have given up on government is because they feel like we have policies on the books, but then those policies aren't actually enacted in real life. This to me is one of the actual responsibilities of government is to say, \"Look, we can actually deliver on enforcing a southern border that lives up to its name like as an actual border.\" If we were to do that, then I believe the confidence level in the American people would increase immeasurably about immigration.</p><p>             Jonathan Capehart, editorial board member: Mr. Yang, can I ask you to drill down a little bit more on this? Because at the start of this conversation you were talking about the problems that the federal government could be addressing and should be addressing.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Yep.</p><p>             Jonathan Capehart: You were talking about your Freedom Dividend, and I was struck by a phrase that you used, which was, you know, getting the Freedom Dividend \"as a right of citizenship.\" And it made me think, maybe I have this at the top of my head because I interviewed him yesterday, but Jonathan Metzl of Vanderbilt University has written the book \"Dying of Whiteness.\" And his whole argument is people are willing to die rather than be connected to or finance policies that they believe are giving resources to people they view as undeserving. So what I would love for you to do is to please talk about how you'd address the clear societal hurdles to achieving the goals that you set out.</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Sure. So none of you had heard of me eight, 10 months ago, I'd imagine. And I'm sitting here having outperformed half a dozen sitting senators, governors, members of Congress. And so you have to ask yourself, how did that happen? And it happened because I'm laser-focused on the real problems that Americans see around us every day, many of which led directly to Donald Trump being elected. Right now, I'm fifth in the polls, rising, fastest-growing candidate or campaign in the race.</p><p>So if we follow this through, I surprise in Iowa, perform extraordinarily well in New Hampshire, I become president of the United States in 2021, everyone would know that I won on the Freedom Dividend because that's my signature proposal. Americans decided that $1,000 a month in cash is pretty great. And so then as president, I'm there celebrating with Democrats and progressives because they're just thrilled we've beaten Donald Trump. They realized it was a bit of a bet, but it worked. And here we are.</p><p>And then the Republicans and conservatives in Congress will look up and say, \"Wait a minute, how do I feel about this dividend? A lot of people in my district seem very excited about it. The one state that's had a dividend for almost 40 years, Alaska, is a deep-red conservative state and it was passed by a Republican governor. This is a big win for rural areas that are struggling and red states on the interior that have gotten blasted by automation.\" And so we just need some of these Republican congressmen to say, \"I am for the dividend because I'm for economic freedom.\" And if you get a majority, then you can pass it. Now, can you get all of them? Almost certainly not. But this is a law like any other. So you don't need a supermajority. You just need a congressional majority to pass the bill.</p><p>             Jonathan Capehart: I mean, one could argue that when President Obama came into office, he was laser-focused on getting health care to as many people as possible. And Obamacare passed, but those Republicans, no Republican voted for it in the House. I'm having a hard time seeing how you're going to break the fever that President Obama thought he was going to do in 2012 simply by your election. How are you going to convince the Americans who are literally willing to die or or stay in dire economic circumstances simply because policies that you'd want to put into place and others want to put into place would benefit someone else?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: I think that the attitude you are describing, while it does apply to a certain subset of Americans, applies to a very, very low proportion of them. And I'm confident of this because when I campaign around the country, at every event I go to, someone comes up to me in the line afterwards and says, \"I voted for Donald Trump. This time I'm voting for you.\" One survey in New Hampshire said that 10 percent of the voters who voted for Trump would vote for me over Trump in the general election. Another survey said that 18 percent of college Republicans would choose me over the president. Now, this is not everyone. But this is enough. You don't need to convert 80 percent of the president's followers. You need to convert, let's call it 20 percent. So this attitude that you're describing is very real. But I believe that it does not contain 100 percent of the folks who voted for Donald Trump. And I know this because, again, they come to me at my events every single time and say, \"You're my candidate this time.\".</p><p>I also believe I'm somewhat different from some of the other Democrats in the field. And I can't speak to Obama, but I've been on Fox News any number of times. I'll talk to anyone. And one friend of mine, whose mother is an avid Fox viewer, said that Yang is the only Democrat I would support because he is the only one who does not seem to be judging me. That is enough for us to get a critical mass of Donald Trump supporters to get around a solution that would dramatically improve their way of life. They can see it.</p><p>The second argument I'd make is that cash is much, much harder to demonize than health care. If you go to a conservative in Kentucky and say \"the government wants to take over your health care,\" you can get people very, very upset about that. If you say, \"hey, this cash is going to hurt you,\" it's going to be tougher. I mean, there might be some someone there who's like, \"yeah, the cash is going to hurt me,\" but others would be like, \"Wait a minute, they do this in Alaska. If I got that money, I think I'd be very productive with it. Sure, some of my neighbors less so, but, you know, first things first.\" So we can get Americans on board because it's such a simple, straightforward vision of citizenship.</p><p>And I've run organizations for decades now. And what I say to people, is this. There are three ways you can treat human beings who work in your organization. No 1. you do nothing, then they leave you within a year. No. 2, you tell them how great they are. That lasts for about a year, and then they leave you before the second year. The third thing you can do is you invest in them. You compensate them. You give them raises, and you genuinely value them and then they'll stay with you forever. Right now in the United States of America, we're doing some combination of one and two with our kids. We're saying, \"Hey, things are great. You can vote.\" They don't really believe it. If you could look at every parent who could then look at their children and say, \"when you turn 18, you're going to get $1,000 a month from your country because your country loves you, your country values you, and we are investing in you,\" that is a game changer for Americans of every political party. And there are many people in red states who are already embracing this vision. I know, because I see them every day.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: Can I just follow up on why you're still here and why we've heard of you?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Sure.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: You say it's because you're focusing on problems that people care about, which I'm sure is right. But you also hear a lot of people say, \"Oh, he sounds like a normal person. Smart person, maybe, but a human being, unlike most politicians.\" And I'm just curious why you think most politicians don't sound like normal people. And as you go up in the polls, do you find yourself under pressure not to or, I mean, what's the process been like for you?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Thank you. It's a really important question. I went through that tension a little bit earlier in the process. I clearly see why politicians do not seem like normal people, because they are surrounded by organizations whose livelihoods are dependent upon this person's political career. And so they deliver to the candidate, \"Okay, here are your talking points. Go to them. Do not go beyond these guardrails. And if you do go beyond these guardrails, then people will throw rocks at you for at least a day, and maybe your career will be over, and then all of our careers will be over.\" So if you're surrounded by that kind of organization and message, then you become very, very guarded pretty quickly. You have your talking points. You deliver them. And Americans can sense it.</p><p>It's a variant of what I was talking about with the universities. But this is actually the big problem in American life. And I'm going to extend it to you all as journalists. Almost 2,000 local newspapers have gone out of business in the last number of years. Why? Because all of the advertising revenue went to the Internet. The local businesses that used to advertise in those papers disappeared. They got zeroed out. Did journalism become less valuable during this time? Well, yes, according to the marketplace, like the marketplace says, it's where zero then is where zero. And the theme of my campaign is, of course, journalism is not worth zero just because the market says it's worth zero. You need journalism to have a functioning democracy. How are you going to vote on things going on in your community if you don't have a local paper? So this is what's going on with politicians is that politicians have very, very clear institutional incentives and then they go to them. It's like the marketplace for politicians. What are their upside for seeming like a human being? Actually quite low because at some point they're going to say something that someone doesn't like, and then everyone will mock them and there'll be a negative press cycle, and their staff will be like, \"You can never do that again.\" Or then what are your incentives for like staying on the straight and narrow? That's like then you get more success, more cable news appearances, like your team pats you on the back and says, \"Great job. You didn't say anything that was off your talking points.\"</p><p>So our politicians seem increasingly like flies stuck in amber. And it's one reason why Trump won is because even though he is a narcissist reality TV star, and many Americans sense that he has massive character problems, he struck people as \"more authentic\" than our politicians. And it's because our system has become overrun by these market and institutional incentives that have pummeled the humanity out of otherwise well-meaning public servants.</p><p>I experienced this myself when I was rising. I acted like a human being when no one cared. No one was watching me, it didn't matter. I got like a little bit of visibility and then some negative press cycles. And then people were like, \"Hey, you know, maybe you should like stick to the script.\" And then I stuck to the script for a little while, and then it didn't work for us. So then I started evincing more humanity again, and then we started rising again. And then here we are. And now I'm happy to say, like, I get to act like myself and like a human being most all of the time because it's worked for us. It's actually our major competitive advantage, relative to the field, that I seem like a human being speaking English in terms that most of us can understand. And, you know, that's what we need right now. So thank you for the question.</p><p>             Jo-Ann Armao, associate editorial page editor: So do you ever run into people who say, \"Hey, you know, we tried to nontraditional like last time with Donald Trump? That didn't work out so well, so I'm a little bit leery about you?\"</p><p>             Andrew Yang: I do get that.</p><p>             Jo-Ann Armao: And what do you say?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: And what I say to them, I've got a few responses. No. 1 is I say, look, I'd be the last person who would say I was going to run government like a business, because they're two completely different things with different leadership styles. And anyone who thinks otherwise is a moron. And then I say running government will be much closer to what I did running a national nonprofit that had thousands of stakeholders, where you have to try and generate consensus and galvanize energy around a vision that will get people excited. The other thing I say is that Donald Trump is not every non-politician in the world, that there are actually many people that are sound human beings who just want to solve problems. And he should not represent every person who's not spent a career in politics. And No. 3, I say that Americans have been looking for some kind of change agent for years now because we sense that our government is behind the curve. And that's not just Trump and Bernie Sanders's outsized success. But you can even see that in Barack Obama's election in  08, where people were hungry for some form of change. And we're still looking for it. And the fact is that change is unlikely to come from someone who has spent decades on Capitol Hill.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: And even though you are still able to act as a human, you're also having to say the same thing again and again. I'm sure every question we've asked, you've heard before, and you've explained the Freedom Dividend. And so how do you do that without sounding bored or getting bored with yourself?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Well well, part of it is I don't have any talking points. So if you were to watch 100 interviews with me, there'd be a lot of similarities, no doubt. But there's something different about each one of them because I would go insane otherwise. So I might get an identical question and answer it differently depending upon the day. Honestly, because I'm a human being and you know, like, sometimes something else is a more appealing.</p><p>             Jackson Diehl, deputy editorial page editor: Foreign policy. I went through your answers to the Council on Foreign Relations, and I was struck by several times where you said the U.S. response to something should be to join the chorus of other countries. In particular, it struck me as an interesting model for what the U.S. role in the world should be. And in particular, when you were asked what should the U.S. do about Xinjiang in China, you said the U.S. should join the chorus of countries that are calling China out. So I guess my question is, is that all?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: That's not all. What we have to do is regenerate our global leadership role through investing in our historic partnerships and alliances. If we want to improve China's treatment of its ethnic minorities, which is reprehensible, to me, you could go it alone or you could try and build an international consensus around it. I would go for path No. 2, and I would actually try and strengthen that consensus in ways that would be important to the Chinese, which is why I'm proposing a world data organization that's analogous to the [World Trade Organization]. If you look at our recent past, China modified its behavior significantly because it thought it was important to join the WTO. And that ended up being positive in some ways for the rest of the world. We need to bring similar pressure in their use of technology and data. And if the Chinese feel like they need to conform to certain standards in order to achieve their economic goals, then they'll be much more likely to actually feel pressure to pull back in some of their abuses. So I don't want to relinquish American global leadership. I want to rebuild American global leadership by actually strengthening our alliances and partnerships and let our friends know that Donald Trump is not forever. We're here and open for business.</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: Also in the world, Abby in Woodstock, N.Y., asked, how would you handle nonstate terrorist groups like ISIS while getting us out of forever wars?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: When I talk to Americans, they do not want us to be in a constant state of armed conflict as we've been for 19 years and counting. There are ways that we can combat ISIS that don't involve semi-permanent occupation of certain territories. So I have a three-part test for armed intervention. No. 1, there is a clear, national interest at stake or the ability to avert a humanitarian crisis. No. 2, there's a clearly defined timeline where we can bring our troops out. And No. 3, we have allies and partners that are willing to join us in the mission. Something like ISIS would satisfy all three, where there is a clear national interest, we should be able to define a timeline, and if we have partners and allies that are willing to join us in that that mission, which we do in that case, then we'll be able to act in concert. So I do not want to engage in forever wars ...</p><p>             Fred Hiatt: You can define a timeline maybe to destroy the caliphate, but ISIS hasn't gone away. There are Islamist terrorist groups in northern Africa and Afghanistan, and a lot of people in the military would say without some presence on the ground, gathering intelligence and responding, they can't contain those threats on a continuing basis. Is that wrong?</p><p>             Andrew Yang: Well, even then when you say continuing basis, I mean that you can define a timeline, like the timeline could be prolonged and measured in years and still be the right mission.</p><p>             Conversations with the Post Editorial Board:          </p><p>             Michael Bennet,              2020 presidential candidate          </p><p>             Pete Buttigieg,              2020 presidential candidate          </p><p>             Deval Patrick,              2020 presidential candidate           </p><p>             Read more:          </p><p>             What will happen in the primaries?

But by 2016, after becoming essentially monopolies with help from the feds and the Deep State establishment, they began to roll out full-blown censorship and surveillance, while manipulating what users see. In short, companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Alphabet (which owns YouTube and Google), and many more deceived their users. And now that they think they are indispensable to humanity and unstoppable, they shut the trap door, with conservatives on the outside looking in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the battle is far from finished. And as the reality of Big Government and Big Tech colluding together to manipulate humanity and promote propaganda becomes increasingly obvious, alternatives are emerging quickly. Plus, with the demand for truth growing across America and worldwide, it seems highly likely that suppliers will continue finding ways to supply it.</p><p>For now, Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube) dominate the online advertising market, creating a sort of Internet ad duopoly that controls an estimated 75 percent of the digital advertising market. Already, though, a dizzying array of alternatives to the Big Tech giants has started to emerge. From new search engines to new social-media services, the number of options is multiplying quickly. Many of the options are decentralized and innovative, marking a sharp departure from the centralized top-down control of existing technology giants. More will be coming soon. And while plenty may eventually fade into obscurity, some are already enjoying incredible growth. Plus, every minute that a user spends on an alternative company's website means less advertising dollars for the tech giants - and less data on users to analyze, monetize, and, eventually, weaponize.</p><p>Obviously, corporate silencing of dissent is not the only troubling element of the Big Tech giants. At the top of concerns for users is privacy. And with new scandals about abuses of privacy emerging on a continual basis, a growing number of people are voting with their digital devices and using alternatives. In late July, Facebook lost $120 billion in value in one day - about 20 percent of the company's market capitalization - setting a new record in stock-market history. And that incredible sell-off was caused, in part at least, by \"reduced use,\" with users spending less time on the platform and user growth slowing dramatically. In early 2018, Facebook announced its firstever decline in daily U.S. users. With the company making a deliberate decision to purge conservatives, there may be more downside still to come.</p><p>But many fear the wrath of the tech giants. In fact, as the reality of the accelerating purge became impossible to ignore once Alex Jones and Infowars were \"de-platformed,\" a sort of \"panic\" set in among some contrarian voices. After all, if they could take down a media empire with many millions of staunchly loyal supporters and links to the White House, they could take down anybody. The New American magazine, Breitbart, WND, Drudge, or any other conservative site could easily go down too - in fact, all of them have already been massively suppressed by Big Tech. Even Fox News, which often parrots the establishment line but with a supposedly \"conservative\" spin, has found itself in the cross hairs of those demanding bans and censorship. And so there was an almost universal understanding, even among many liberals, that something would have to be done. But the question was and remains: What, if anything, can be done?</p><p>Flurry of Ideas on How to Respond</p><p>The ideas for what sort of response is needed were as numerous as they were varied. On one side, more than a few called for government intervention. Arguing that the Big Tech giants have become monopolies, the call to have government intervene was loud and clear from Congress and the White House to Main Street America. The companies' deep ties to government, too, have been cited to justify government intervention. On the other hand, countless voices urged conservatives, Christians, libertarians, nationalists, patriots, and all other victims of the Big Tech censorship machine to simply ditch the companies that hate them so much, or urged everyone to try out alternatives. And there are plenty. More on that below.</p><p>Among those calling for government to step in, there are several strategies being pursued. One of the key avenues involves the so-called Communications Decency Act. Essentially, under that 1996 statute, as long as companies act as politically neutral venues for others to post content, they are generally immune from liability over the content on their sites. For instance, if a Facebook user were to libel somebody or violate copyright, the company itself would not be liable for the speech. However, the same protections do not apply to companies that exercise editorial discretion in the content that appears on their platforms. As such, if a newspaper, for instance, libels a person, or steals another person's intellectual property, the paper would be liable under the law.</p><p>A number of high-profile lawmakers have jumped on this. At a Senate hearing in early 2018, Senator Ted Cruz (R~ Texas) began by asking representatives of the Internet giants - Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube - whether they consider themselves to be \"neutral\" in providing a forum for public discussion. All of them answered yes. But then Cruz highlighted the fact that a Twitter official was caught on hidden camera by Project Veritas investigators bragging about \"shadowbanning\" conservatives, a tactic that hides the victims' posts from others without the targeted individual even realizing that his content is not being seen by anyone. The senator from Texas also noted that Twitter initially blocked an announcement by Congressman Marsha Blackburn (RTenn.) due to the content being pro-life.</p><p>There are countless other examples. \"The pattern of political censorship we are seeing across the technology companies is highly concerning,\" Senator Cruz said in his closing remarks. \"And the opening question I asked of whether you are a neutral public forum - if you are a neutral public forum, that does not allow for political editorializing and censorship. And if you are not a neutral public forum, the entire predicate for liability immunity under the CDA [Communications Decency Act] is claiming to be a neutral public forum, so you cannot have it both ways.\" And indeed, as the purge of anti-establishment voices gets more and more extreme, countless prominent pundits and others have called for the Big Tech giants to lose their immunity under CDA. They are clearly biased against conservatives and Republicans - even the Left admits that.</p><p>Beyond the CDA, more than a few prominent voices, including plenty on the Left, have called for breaking up the Internet \"monopolies\" of Facebook, Google, YouTube, and so on by using antitrust statutes. Some heavy hitters have even argued that the Big Tech monopolies are more problematic than the old monopolies of the \"robber barons.\" James Delingpole at Breitbart, for instance, wrote: \"These Silicon Valley tech firms form the kind of oppressive, anti-consumer oligopoly that prompted Teddy Roosevelt's trust-busting in the early 20th century. The difference between Jeff Bezos and [John D.] Rockefeller is that whereas Rockefeller just controlled oil, Bezos and his ilk control 'ideas, information, perception of the world.'\" And it is even worse than that. \"Whatever threat these organizations pose to individual freedoms, the way they work in cahoots with governments is more dangerous still,\" Delingpole continued, calling on President Trump to step in and save Western civilization from the death of free speech being orchestrated by Big Tech and its totalitarian allies in Big Government all over the world.</p><p>More than a few people with Trump's ear are urging him to do that. Longtime Trump advisor and confidant Roger Stone, for instance, urged the administration to get involved. \"It is Internet freedom, it is the rise of a robust and vigorous alternative media through the Internet, that allowed Donald Trump to become president,\" said Stone, who works closely with Infowars. \"And now, his critics want to put the toothpaste back into the tube. They want to return to the days when only ABC, NBC, and CBS controlled the political dialogue. Trump's election would have been impossible under those circumstances.... We are being punished because we broadcast the truth. We are being shut down because we are a threat to the globalists and the Chinese Communist plan to take over this country.\" Warning that Infowars was just the beginning, Stone suggested that the Justice Department should use antitrust laws to end the political censorship by the Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>And Trump may be responding. In fact, in a number of posts on Twitter, Trump suggested that his administration was looking into Big Tech's war on free speech and would be taking action - especially concerning efforts to tip the election to Democrats. On July 26, Trump criticized Twitter in a tweet after it emerged that the website was making it more difficult for users to see posts of certain conservative lawmakers in Congress. \"Twitter 'SHADOW BANNING' prominent Republicans. Not good,\" Trump said. \"We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once. Many complaints.\" Since Jones and Infowars were banned, Trump has gone even further in terms of speaking out. And when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development went after Facebook for aiding and abetting discrimination in housing, more than a few of Facebook's foes celebrated.</p><p>Some opinion molders are advocating that the government create an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" that would protect free speech online. Investigative journalist and best-selling author Jerome Corsi, whose own YouTube channel was taken down before being put back online, told The New American that the status quo when it comes to social media is unacceptable. \"The mainstream media is desperately fighting for its survival,\" he said. \"And the way to do it is to get the social-media companies to throw out every other viewpoint.\" Noting that violent \"Antifa\" hate is welcome across the social-media platforms, while the Bible and support for the Second Amendment are increasingly being purged, Corsi said the establishment was trying to eliminate the visibility of views that are not aligned with its agenda.</p><p>While conservatives are typically reluctant to call for federal action, Corsi argued that it has now become hard to tell where the Internet giants end and the government begins. In particular, Corsi expressed frustration over the fact that the far-left leadership of the Internet companies was completely in bed with government and left-wing politicians such as the Clinton family. \"These companies are so penetrated by the intelligence agencies you wonder if they aren't just new names for the agencies,\" he said, noting that the U.S. government's intelligence apparatus had even funded many of the firms and was harvesting unfathomable amounts of data from them. \"When you get to the heart of what's going on in social media, it's an intelligence operation. That's what I was seeking to expose. This is no longer just a private enterprise.... Social media has become a backdoor for Big Brother.\"</p><p>Because of this intimate relationship with the government, and because the Big Tech firms could ramp up the purge ahead of the 2018 elections and swing the vote, Corsi said conservatives must recognize the danger and demand action. In particular, he said it was time for the government to step in and protect individual rights online. Along with touting an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" that would apply to the online world the free speech protections, due process protections, and protection from surveillance and datagathering without warrants contained in the U.S. Constitution, Corsi also called for antitrust investigations, which he said are more than warranted considering the companies' anti-competitive behavior. And finally, Corsi called for an official investigation into what these companies have been doing and the precise nature of their links to government. After all, if government built these companies - and it certainly helped, at the very least - then free-speech rights ought to be protected on their platforms, too, he argued.</p><p>Non-government Alternatives</p><p>Obviously, government involvement in regulating nominally private companies has plenty of critics among conservatives, libertarians, and constitutionalists. For one, a plain reading of the U.S. Constitution does not reveal any delegation of the authority required. Some critics even worry that such a move could be the proverbial camel's nose under the tent, letting government itself become empowered to control speech online. Plus, demanding that Christian bakers and florists celebrate homosexual \"marriages\" has left a horrible taste in many people's mouths - making the idea of forcing companies to host speech they disagree with seem particularly wrong. After all, the leftist mind can simultaneously believe that companies should be free to ban speech they dislike, but that Christians must celebrate what they consider evil or be destroyed. For conservatives, that smacks of liberal hypocrisy.</p><p>CEO Art Thompson with The John Birch Society, the constitutionalist grassroots organization that publishes this magazine, argued that entrepreneurs with a dedication to the truth over money must help create alternative spaces for free speech. \"The one solution to the problems of the Internet in a free society is competition,\" he said in an e-mail. \"More sites that sustain freedom of speech for all need to be produced, advertised, and used. People should intentionally seek out sites that - excepting pornography and the advocacy of a violent overthrow of the government - are committed to staying the course on free speech and would not willingly sell out their sites for megabucks.\"</p><p>\"When the First Amendment was drawn up, it only mentioned the two means of communication available at the time: speech and press,\" continued Thompson. \"Communication methods invented since then have all come under the regulation or control of the government in league with big-money businessmen who wish to use government to squash their competition, violating the original intent of the Bill of Rights. The two most obvious communication alternatives that were brought under government control were radio and television, which by 1970 were not only under the direction of the Federal Communications Commission but were basically consolidated and bought out by tycoons who were members of, or under the influence of, the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization that advocates global socialism (which is the control of everyone by a few handpicked bureaucrats under an organization such as the United Nations).\"</p><p>Thompson continued: \"Since the advent of the Internet, left-wing billionaires have been buying out most every new online site that reaches the masses, and government has been seeking to control it through so-called net neutrality. This is what I mean by staying the course and not succumbing to the allure of millions or billions of dollars, and serving the greater need for freedom of speech. The more voices open to free speech, the less likely they can tell be silenced.</p><p>Already, alternatives are popping up right and left. And people are using them, too. Among the emerging alternatives in the social-media space are companies such as Gab.ai, Minds, OneWay, Local Activist, MeWe, and more. Alternatives to YouTube that have received a major boost in recent weeks include BitChute and Real.Video. And in the search-engine market, a number of alternatives exist and are expanding quickly. These include DuckDuckGo, Searx.me, GoodGopher, StartPage, and more. Legacy alternatives such as Yahoo and Microsoft's Bing exist, too, although they suffer from many of the same problems as Google. Steemit and Patreon are providing alternative revenue sources for content creators - something crucial as YouTube works to bankrupt conservatives and enrich leftist-hatemongers-The-majore-mail providers are facing competition from privacy-oriented competitors such as ProluiiMail in Switzerland, which uses encryption to help users protect privacy, and many others. And even the Drudge Report, which constantly links to establishment propaganda but has traditionally been perceived as more friendly to conservatives and alternative voices, faces new competition from the fast-growing aggregator WhatFinger.com.</p><p>But changing services can be tough. Companies such as Google have become so pervasive that, to many, trying to cut ties with the increasingly \"evil\" giant seems hopeless. But Asia-focused freelancejournalist Nithin Coca did it, and shared his secrets with the world in a popular article about it. \"Today, I am Google free, part of the western world's ultimate digital minority, someone who does not use products from the world's two most valuable technology companies (yes, I don't use Facebook either),\" he explained. \"The truth is, alternatives do exist, many of which have launched in the years since Edward Snowden revealed Google's participation in Prism.\" And throughout the rest of the article, he provides a comprehensive list of all the alternative products and services he used to cut Google out of his life completely. It is well worth the read for anyone who is tired of being abused by the corporate Leviathan.</p><p>Some of the emerging alternatives are concerned that efforts to have Big Tech declared a \"public utility\" and the Internet subjected to more federal regulation would actually boost Big Tech's power permanently. In a letter to President Trump, OneWay.com President Derek Peterson, BitChute.com President Ray Vahey, and other tech leaders urged Trump not to have government barge in. \"We are very concerned that the actions of some of the bad actors in the technology world will result in regulations that could limit free speech and liberty in general,\" they wrote. \"We believe that the technologies we and others are developing will correct the market in a very short time and are concerned that any kind of regulation concerning speech or making these companies government sponsored 'public squares' or 'utilities' of some kind will further cement their place in our lives, make them more powerful and only make it more difficult or even impossible for the market to self correct.\" They basically asked the Trump administration to let the free market work, cut regulation, and adopt the technology as it is developed.</p><p>Author and technology expert Patrick Wood is right in the middle of all of it. As the author of Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation and editor of Technocracy News &amp; Trends, Wood understands the technocratic scheming of the globalist establishment. As the executive director of Citizens for Free Speech, he is deeply involved in the battle for free speech. But unlike those seeking federal solutions, Wood told The New American that the real answer is at the local level, in communities across America. That is why his organization is preparing to launch LocalActivist.org, a social-media service that aims to connect local activists with each other so they can see and post community events, join local groups that have been established for some specific local issue, and much more. The beta testing is already under way.</p><p>Commenting on the recent purges, Wood suggested Big Tech may be digging its own grave. \"All social-media companies are public corporations and inherently have the right to do whatever they desire, short of breaking the law,\" he explained. \"However, they are not immune to lawsuits from people who have been materially harmed by their actions, and I expect such lawsuits to proliferate. Censorship is not illegal, but socialmedia giants who practice it will now be forced to compete for ideas on the open stage of society. They are naively walking into a trap of their own making, and they will lose. Just like the NFL lost massive numbers of long-term viewers over player protests, social-media giants risk bringing the same kind of punishment upon themselves.... Technocrats that they are, they really don't realize that their ultimate fate is in the hands of the free market!\"</p><p>Of course, those companies are doing everything they can to suppress competition, even buying up or trying to cripple potential competitors before they can do too much damage. But even those machinations are running up against opposition. One of the increasingly prominent social-media platforms competing with Facebook is known as Minds.com. Not surprisingly, Google was quick to ban the company from its ad program. But Minds CEO Bill Ottman responded not by whining - although he was invited to air his concerns on one of TV's most popular news programs - but by announcing that his company was creating its own ad network to compete against the giants. It will use \"block-chain\" technology, which is all the rage in tech circles today, making it virtually impossible to manipulate or hack. And unlike the Big Tech companies, Minds' ad alternatives will be totally transparent, even using open-source code that anyone is welcome to inspect.</p><p>Speaking on Fox News' Tucker Carlson program, Minds CEO Ottman explained how Google was working to censor his company. Worse still, as Carlson noted, through their dominant position in online ads, Google and Facebook are able to have massive leverage over news sources and content creators - leverage that they frequently use, threatening and in some cases destroying alternative voices that refuse to do their bidding. Ottman said it is even worse than people realize, though. \"When you go to people's websites who host Google ads, Google is actually spying on you through those websites,\" Ottman explained after Carlson argued that the duopoly practically \"owns\" news sites by controlling the whole ad market. \"So by putting Google ads on your website, you're actually becoming an agent of Google. That's why we need transparent, more freedom-based ad platforms to emerge which don't spy on people.\" And that is what his company, Minds, is working to provide.</p><p>Truth Cannot Be Silenced</p><p>No matter how vigorously Big Tech and Big Government work to censor the truth, it cannot be totally suppressed. But that does not mean the establishment will not use dirty tricks in its efforts to try. Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and numerous other prominent voices even suggested that there may be an imminent false-flag attack against the media to be blamed on Trump, Infowars, and others. And indeed, with top United Nations officials suggesting that Trump could be prosecuted for \"incitement\" against the media if and when something bad happens, it is hardly far-fetched to suggest that the globalist establishment could be planning something. An incredible series of blatant lies against Jones and Trump pushed by the establishment, coinciding with the unprecedented and escalating purge of dissenting voices online, certainly suggests something fishy is going on.</p><p>But even without a false-flag attack, the threat of full-blown Internet censorship at the national and even the global level is very real. With Obama having surrendered control over Internet infrastructure to globalist \"stakeholders\" unbound by the First Amendment, and with the UN and many of its more oppressive member regimes actively campaigning for censorship worldwide, Internet freedom has never been in more grave danger. Key components of the Internet's architecture were transferred to \"international stakeholders,\" making it potentially feasible to literally wipe somebody off the Internet completely - not just off social media. And the UN installed an actual Chinese Communist (who claims censorship is in the eye of the beholder) at the top of the UN International Telecommunications Union, the agency currently being groomed by the establishment for the role of world Internet regulator and censor. If the Orwellian trends are not halted, it could be just a matter of time before the World Wide Web faces fullblown_censorship by a rogue alliance of _ governments, dictators, international institutions, and their Big Business cronies.</p><p>But ultimately, even if the Internet is completely undermined as an effective means of educating and activating resistance to the establishment and its agenda, the fight for truth and against tyranny must go on. The John Birch Society has been leading the effort to save diminishing freedoms since the late 1950s - generations before the Internet was even born. Tools for accomplishing that included and still include printed publications, videos and DVDs, grassroots educational campaigns, public speeches to educate local communities and opinion molders, and much more. And despite the emergence of the Internet, these tools are still far from obsolete. If, somehow, the establishment manages to shut down the World Wide Web as a useful tool to disseminate the truth, The John Birch Society will continue to get the information out. And you can help.

But by 2016, after becoming essentially monopolies with help from the feds and the Deep State establishment, they began to roll out full-blown censorship and surveillance, while manipulating what users see. In short, companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Alphabet (which owns YouTube and Google), and many more deceived their users. And now that they think they are indispensable to humanity and unstoppable, they shut the trap door, with conservatives on the outside looking in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the battle is far from finished. And as the reality of Big Government and Big Tech colluding together to manipulate humanity and promote propaganda becomes increasingly obvious, alternatives are emerging quickly. Plus, with the demand for truth growing across America and worldwide, it seems highly likely that suppliers will continue finding ways to supply it.</p><p>For now, Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube) dominate the online advertising market, creating a sort of Internet ad duopoly that controls an estimated 75 percent of the digital advertising market. Already, though, a dizzying array of alternatives to the Big Tech giants has started to emerge. From new search engines to new social-media services, the number of options is multiplying quickly. Many of the options are decentralized and innovative, marking a sharp departure from the centralized top-down control of existing technology giants. More will be coming soon. And while plenty may eventually fade into obscurity, some are already enjoying incredible growth. Plus, every minute that a user spends on an alternative company's website means less advertising dollars for the tech giants - and less data on users to analyze, monetize, and, eventually, weaponize.</p><p>Obviously, corporate silencing of dissent is not the only troubling element of the Big Tech giants. At the top of concerns for users is privacy. And with new scandals about abuses of privacy emerging on a continual basis, a growing number of people are voting with their digital devices and using alternatives. In late July, Facebook lost $120 billion in value in one day - about 20 percent of the company's market capitalization - setting a new record in stock-market history. And that incredible sell-off was caused, in part at least, by \"reduced use,\" with users spending less time on the platform and user growth slowing dramatically. In early 2018, Facebook announced its firstever decline in daily U.S. users. With the company making a deliberate decision to purge conservatives, there may be more downside still to come.</p><p>But many fear the wrath of the tech giants. In fact, as the reality of the accelerating purge became impossible to ignore once Alex Jones and Infowars were \"de-platformed,\" a sort of \"panic\" set in among some contrarian voices. After all, if they could take down a media empire with many millions of staunchly loyal supporters and links to the White House, they could take down anybody. The New American magazine, Breitbart, WND, Drudge, or any other conservative site could easily go down too - in fact, all of them have already been massively suppressed by Big Tech. Even Fox News, which often parrots the establishment line but with a supposedly \"conservative\" spin, has found itself in the cross hairs of those demanding bans and censorship. And so there was an almost universal understanding, even among many liberals, that something would have to be done. But the question was and remains: What, if anything, can be done?</p><p>Flurry of Ideas on How to Respond</p><p>The ideas for what sort of response is needed were as numerous as they were varied. On one side, more than a few called for government intervention. Arguing that the Big Tech giants have become monopolies, the call to have government intervene was loud and clear from Congress and the White House to Main Street America. The companies' deep ties to government, too, have been cited to justify government intervention. On the other hand, countless voices urged conservatives, Christians, libertarians, nationalists, patriots, and all other victims of the Big Tech censorship machine to simply ditch the companies that hate them so much, or urged everyone to try out alternatives. And there are plenty. More on that below.</p><p>Among those calling for government to step in, there are several strategies being pursued. One of the key avenues involves the so-called Communications Decency Act. Essentially, under that 1996 statute, as long as companies act as politically neutral venues for others to post content, they are generally immune from liability over the content on their sites. For instance, if a Facebook user were to libel somebody or violate copyright, the company itself would not be liable for the speech. However, the same protections do not apply to companies that exercise editorial discretion in the content that appears on their platforms. As such, if a newspaper, for instance, libels a person, or steals another person's intellectual property, the paper would be liable under the law.</p><p>A number of high-profile lawmakers have jumped on this. At a Senate hearing in early 2018, Senator Ted Cruz (R~ Texas) began by asking representatives of the Internet giants - Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube - whether they consider themselves to be \"neutral\" in providing a forum for public discussion. All of them answered yes. But then Cruz highlighted the fact that a Twitter official was caught on hidden camera by Project Veritas investigators bragging about \"shadowbanning\" conservatives, a tactic that hides the victims' posts from others without the targeted individual even realizing that his content is not being seen by anyone. The senator from Texas also noted that Twitter initially blocked an announcement by Congressman Marsha Blackburn (RTenn.) due to the content being pro-life.</p><p>There are countless other examples. \"The pattern of political censorship we are seeing across the technology companies is highly concerning,\" Senator Cruz said in his closing remarks. \"And the opening question I asked of whether you are a neutral public forum - if you are a neutral public forum, that does not allow for political editorializing and censorship. And if you are not a neutral public forum, the entire predicate for liability immunity under the CDA [Communications Decency Act] is claiming to be a neutral public forum, so you cannot have it both ways.\" And indeed, as the purge of anti-establishment voices gets more and more extreme, countless prominent pundits and others have called for the Big Tech giants to lose their immunity under CDA. They are clearly biased against conservatives and Republicans - even the Left admits that.</p><p>Beyond the CDA, more than a few prominent voices, including plenty on the Left, have called for breaking up the Internet \"monopolies\" of Facebook, Google, YouTube, and so on by using antitrust statutes. Some heavy hitters have even argued that the Big Tech monopolies are more problematic than the old monopolies of the \"robber barons.\" James Delingpole at Breitbart, for instance, wrote: \"These Silicon Valley tech firms form the kind of oppressive, anti-consumer oligopoly that prompted Teddy Roosevelt's trust-busting in the early 20th century. The difference between Jeff Bezos and [John D.] Rockefeller is that whereas Rockefeller just controlled oil, Bezos and his ilk control 'ideas, information, perception of the world.'\" And it is even worse than that. \"Whatever threat these organizations pose to individual freedoms, the way they work in cahoots with governments is more dangerous still,\" Delingpole continued, calling on President Trump to step in and save Western civilization from the death of free speech being orchestrated by Big Tech and its totalitarian allies in Big Government all over the world.</p><p>More than a few people with Trump's ear are urging him to do that. Longtime Trump advisor and confidant Roger Stone, for instance, urged the administration to get involved. \"It is Internet freedom, it is the rise of a robust and vigorous alternative media through the Internet, that allowed Donald Trump to become president,\" said Stone, who works closely with Infowars. \"And now, his critics want to put the toothpaste back into the tube. They want to return to the days when only ABC, NBC, and CBS controlled the political dialogue. Trump's election would have been impossible under those circumstances.... We are being punished because we broadcast the truth. We are being shut down because we are a threat to the globalists and the Chinese Communist plan to take over this country.\" Warning that Infowars was just the beginning, Stone suggested that the Justice Department should use antitrust laws to end the political censorship by the Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>And Trump may be responding. In fact, in a number of posts on Twitter, Trump suggested that his administration was looking into Big Tech's war on free speech and would be taking action - especially concerning efforts to tip the election to Democrats. On July 26, Trump criticized Twitter in a tweet after it emerged that the website was making it more difficult for users to see posts of certain conservative lawmakers in Congress. \"Twitter 'SHADOW BANNING' prominent Republicans. Not good,\" Trump said. \"We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once. Many complaints.\" Since Jones and Infowars were banned, Trump has gone even further in terms of speaking out. And when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development went after Facebook for aiding and abetting discrimination in housing, more than a few of Facebook's foes celebrated.</p><p>Some opinion molders are advocating that the government create an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" that would protect free speech online. Investigative journalist and best-selling author Jerome Corsi, whose own YouTube channel was taken down before being put back online, told The New American that the status quo when it comes to social media is unacceptable. \"The mainstream media is desperately fighting for its survival,\" he said. \"And the way to do it is to get the social-media companies to throw out every other viewpoint.\" Noting that violent \"Antifa\" hate is welcome across the social-media platforms, while the Bible and support for the Second Amendment are increasingly being purged, Corsi said the establishment was trying to eliminate the visibility of views that are not aligned with its agenda.</p><p>While conservatives are typically reluctant to call for federal action, Corsi argued that it has now become hard to tell where the Internet giants end and the government begins. In particular, Corsi expressed frustration over the fact that the far-left leadership of the Internet companies was completely in bed with government and left-wing politicians such as the Clinton family. \"These companies are so penetrated by the intelligence agencies you wonder if they aren't just new names for the agencies,\" he said, noting that the U.S. government's intelligence apparatus had even funded many of the firms and was harvesting unfathomable amounts of data from them. \"When you get to the heart of what's going on in social media, it's an intelligence operation. That's what I was seeking to expose. This is no longer just a private enterprise.... Social media has become a backdoor for Big Brother.\"</p><p>Because of this intimate relationship with the government, and because the Big Tech firms could ramp up the purge ahead of the 2018 elections and swing the vote, Corsi said conservatives must recognize the danger and demand action. In particular, he said it was time for the government to step in and protect individual rights online. Along with touting an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" that would apply to the online world the free speech protections, due process protections, and protection from surveillance and datagathering without warrants contained in the U.S. Constitution, Corsi also called for antitrust investigations, which he said are more than warranted considering the companies' anti-competitive behavior. And finally, Corsi called for an official investigation into what these companies have been doing and the precise nature of their links to government. After all, if government built these companies - and it certainly helped, at the very least - then free-speech rights ought to be protected on their platforms, too, he argued.</p><p>Non-government Alternatives</p><p>Obviously, government involvement in regulating nominally private companies has plenty of critics among conservatives, libertarians, and constitutionalists. For one, a plain reading of the U.S. Constitution does not reveal any delegation of the authority required. Some critics even worry that such a move could be the proverbial camel's nose under the tent, letting government itself become empowered to control speech online. Plus, demanding that Christian bakers and florists celebrate homosexual \"marriages\" has left a horrible taste in many people's mouths - making the idea of forcing companies to host speech they disagree with seem particularly wrong. After all, the leftist mind can simultaneously believe that companies should be free to ban speech they dislike, but that Christians must celebrate what they consider evil or be destroyed. For conservatives, that smacks of liberal hypocrisy.</p><p>CEO Art Thompson with The John Birch Society, the constitutionalist grassroots organization that publishes this magazine, argued that entrepreneurs with a dedication to the truth over money must help create alternative spaces for free speech. \"The one solution to the problems of the Internet in a free society is competition,\" he said in an e-mail. \"More sites that sustain freedom of speech for all need to be produced, advertised, and used. People should intentionally seek out sites that - excepting pornography and the advocacy of a violent overthrow of the government - are committed to staying the course on free speech and would not willingly sell out their sites for megabucks.\"</p><p>\"When the First Amendment was drawn up, it only mentioned the two means of communication available at the time: speech and press,\" continued Thompson. \"Communication methods invented since then have all come under the regulation or control of the government in league with big-money businessmen who wish to use government to squash their competition, violating the original intent of the Bill of Rights. The two most obvious communication alternatives that were brought under government control were radio and television, which by 1970 were not only under the direction of the Federal Communications Commission but were basically consolidated and bought out by tycoons who were members of, or under the influence of, the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization that advocates global socialism (which is the control of everyone by a few handpicked bureaucrats under an organization such as the United Nations).\"</p><p>Thompson continued: \"Since the advent of the Internet, left-wing billionaires have been buying out most every new online site that reaches the masses, and government has been seeking to control it through so-called net neutrality. This is what I mean by staying the course and not succumbing to the allure of millions or billions of dollars, and serving the greater need for freedom of speech. The more voices open to free speech, the less likely they can tell be silenced.</p><p>Already, alternatives are popping up right and left. And people are using them, too. Among the emerging alternatives in the social-media space are companies such as Gab.ai, Minds, OneWay, Local Activist, MeWe, and more. Alternatives to YouTube that have received a major boost in recent weeks include BitChute and Real.Video. And in the search-engine market, a number of alternatives exist and are expanding quickly. These include DuckDuckGo, Searx.me, GoodGopher, StartPage, and more. Legacy alternatives such as Yahoo and Microsoft's Bing exist, too, although they suffer from many of the same problems as Google. Steemit and Patreon are providing alternative revenue sources for content creators - something crucial as YouTube works to bankrupt conservatives and enrich leftist-hatemongers-The-majore-mail providers are facing competition from privacy-oriented competitors such as ProluiiMail in Switzerland, which uses encryption to help users protect privacy, and many others. And even the Drudge Report, which constantly links to establishment propaganda but has traditionally been perceived as more friendly to conservatives and alternative voices, faces new competition from the fast-growing aggregator WhatFinger.com.</p><p>But changing services can be tough. Companies such as Google have become so pervasive that, to many, trying to cut ties with the increasingly \"evil\" giant seems hopeless. But Asia-focused freelancejournalist Nithin Coca did it, and shared his secrets with the world in a popular article about it. \"Today, I am Google free, part of the western world's ultimate digital minority, someone who does not use products from the world's two most valuable technology companies (yes, I don't use Facebook either),\" he explained. \"The truth is, alternatives do exist, many of which have launched in the years since Edward Snowden revealed Google's participation in Prism.\" And throughout the rest of the article, he provides a comprehensive list of all the alternative products and services he used to cut Google out of his life completely. It is well worth the read for anyone who is tired of being abused by the corporate Leviathan.</p><p>Some of the emerging alternatives are concerned that efforts to have Big Tech declared a \"public utility\" and the Internet subjected to more federal regulation would actually boost Big Tech's power permanently. In a letter to President Trump, OneWay.com President Derek Peterson, BitChute.com President Ray Vahey, and other tech leaders urged Trump not to have government barge in. \"We are very concerned that the actions of some of the bad actors in the technology world will result in regulations that could limit free speech and liberty in general,\" they wrote. \"We believe that the technologies we and others are developing will correct the market in a very short time and are concerned that any kind of regulation concerning speech or making these companies government sponsored 'public squares' or 'utilities' of some kind will further cement their place in our lives, make them more powerful and only make it more difficult or even impossible for the market to self correct.\" They basically asked the Trump administration to let the free market work, cut regulation, and adopt the technology as it is developed.</p><p>Author and technology expert Patrick Wood is right in the middle of all of it. As the author of Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation and editor of Technocracy News &amp; Trends, Wood understands the technocratic scheming of the globalist establishment. As the executive director of Citizens for Free Speech, he is deeply involved in the battle for free speech. But unlike those seeking federal solutions, Wood told The New American that the real answer is at the local level, in communities across America. That is why his organization is preparing to launch LocalActivist.org, a social-media service that aims to connect local activists with each other so they can see and post community events, join local groups that have been established for some specific local issue, and much more. The beta testing is already under way.</p><p>Commenting on the recent purges, Wood suggested Big Tech may be digging its own grave. \"All social-media companies are public corporations and inherently have the right to do whatever they desire, short of breaking the law,\" he explained. \"However, they are not immune to lawsuits from people who have been materially harmed by their actions, and I expect such lawsuits to proliferate. Censorship is not illegal, but socialmedia giants who practice it will now be forced to compete for ideas on the open stage of society. They are naively walking into a trap of their own making, and they will lose. Just like the NFL lost massive numbers of long-term viewers over player protests, social-media giants risk bringing the same kind of punishment upon themselves.... Technocrats that they are, they really don't realize that their ultimate fate is in the hands of the free market!\"</p><p>Of course, those companies are doing everything they can to suppress competition, even buying up or trying to cripple potential competitors before they can do too much damage. But even those machinations are running up against opposition. One of the increasingly prominent social-media platforms competing with Facebook is known as Minds.com. Not surprisingly, Google was quick to ban the company from its ad program. But Minds CEO Bill Ottman responded not by whining - although he was invited to air his concerns on one of TV's most popular news programs - but by announcing that his company was creating its own ad network to compete against the giants. It will use \"block-chain\" technology, which is all the rage in tech circles today, making it virtually impossible to manipulate or hack. And unlike the Big Tech companies, Minds' ad alternatives will be totally transparent, even using open-source code that anyone is welcome to inspect.</p><p>Speaking on Fox News' Tucker Carlson program, Minds CEO Ottman explained how Google was working to censor his company. Worse still, as Carlson noted, through their dominant position in online ads, Google and Facebook are able to have massive leverage over news sources and content creators - leverage that they frequently use, threatening and in some cases destroying alternative voices that refuse to do their bidding. Ottman said it is even worse than people realize, though. \"When you go to people's websites who host Google ads, Google is actually spying on you through those websites,\" Ottman explained after Carlson argued that the duopoly practically \"owns\" news sites by controlling the whole ad market. \"So by putting Google ads on your website, you're actually becoming an agent of Google. That's why we need transparent, more freedom-based ad platforms to emerge which don't spy on people.\" And that is what his company, Minds, is working to provide.</p><p>Truth Cannot Be Silenced</p><p>No matter how vigorously Big Tech and Big Government work to censor the truth, it cannot be totally suppressed. But that does not mean the establishment will not use dirty tricks in its efforts to try. Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and numerous other prominent voices even suggested that there may be an imminent false-flag attack against the media to be blamed on Trump, Infowars, and others. And indeed, with top United Nations officials suggesting that Trump could be prosecuted for \"incitement\" against the media if and when something bad happens, it is hardly far-fetched to suggest that the globalist establishment could be planning something. An incredible series of blatant lies against Jones and Trump pushed by the establishment, coinciding with the unprecedented and escalating purge of dissenting voices online, certainly suggests something fishy is going on.</p><p>But even without a false-flag attack, the threat of full-blown Internet censorship at the national and even the global level is very real. With Obama having surrendered control over Internet infrastructure to globalist \"stakeholders\" unbound by the First Amendment, and with the UN and many of its more oppressive member regimes actively campaigning for censorship worldwide, Internet freedom has never been in more grave danger. Key components of the Internet's architecture were transferred to \"international stakeholders,\" making it potentially feasible to literally wipe somebody off the Internet completely - not just off social media. And the UN installed an actual Chinese Communist (who claims censorship is in the eye of the beholder) at the top of the UN International Telecommunications Union, the agency currently being groomed by the establishment for the role of world Internet regulator and censor. If the Orwellian trends are not halted, it could be just a matter of time before the World Wide Web faces fullblown_censorship by a rogue alliance of _ governments, dictators, international institutions, and their Big Business cronies.</p><p>But ultimately, even if the Internet is completely undermined as an effective means of educating and activating resistance to the establishment and its agenda, the fight for truth and against tyranny must go on. The John Birch Society has been leading the effort to save diminishing freedoms since the late 1950s - generations before the Internet was even born. Tools for accomplishing that included and still include printed publications, videos and DVDs, grassroots educational campaigns, public speeches to educate local communities and opinion molders, and much more. And despite the emergence of the Internet, these tools are still far from obsolete. If, somehow, the establishment manages to shut down the World Wide Web as a useful tool to disseminate the truth, The John Birch Society will continue to get the information out. And you can help. Get involved, or get more involved, today! *</p><p>For now, Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube) dominate the online advertising market, creating a sort of Internet ad duopoly that controls an estimated 75 percent of the digital advertising market.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2113740415</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS4-XGG1-JBHT-D3DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4278\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Sep 17, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

But by 2016, after becoming essentially monopolies with help from the feds and the Deep State establishment, they began to roll out full-blown censorship and surveillance, while manipulating what users see. In short, companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Alphabet (which owns YouTube and Google), and many more deceived their users. And now that they think they are indispensable to humanity and unstoppable, they shut the trap door, with conservatives on the outside looking in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the battle is far from finished. And as the reality of Big Government and Big Tech colluding together to manipulate humanity and promote propaganda becomes increasingly obvious, alternatives are emerging quickly. Plus, with the demand for truth growing across America and worldwide, it seems highly likely that suppliers will continue finding ways to supply it.</p><p>For now, Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube) dominate the online advertising market, creating a sort of Internet ad duopoly that controls an estimated 75 percent of the digital advertising market. Already, though, a dizzying array of alternatives to the Big Tech giants has started to emerge. From new search engines to new social-media services, the number of options is multiplying quickly. Many of the options are decentralized and innovative, marking a sharp departure from the centralized top-down control of existing technology giants. More will be coming soon. And while plenty may eventually fade into obscurity, some are already enjoying incredible growth. Plus, every minute that a user spends on an alternative company's website means less advertising dollars for the tech giants - and less data on users to analyze, monetize, and, eventually, weaponize.</p><p>Obviously, corporate silencing of dissent is not the only troubling element of the Big Tech giants. At the top of concerns for users is privacy. And with new scandals about abuses of privacy emerging on a continual basis, a growing number of people are voting with their digital devices and using alternatives. In late July, Facebook lost $120 billion in value in one day - about 20 percent of the company's market capitalization - setting a new record in stock-market history. And that incredible sell-off was caused, in part at least, by \"reduced use,\" with users spending less time on the platform and user growth slowing dramatically. In early 2018, Facebook announced its firstever decline in daily U.S. users. With the company making a deliberate decision to purge conservatives, there may be more downside still to come.</p><p>But many fear the wrath of the tech giants. In fact, as the reality of the accelerating purge became impossible to ignore once Alex Jones and Infowars were \"de-platformed,\" a sort of \"panic\" set in among some contrarian voices. After all, if they could take down a media empire with many millions of staunchly loyal supporters and links to the White House, they could take down anybody. The New American magazine, Breitbart, WND, Drudge, or any other conservative site could easily go down too - in fact, all of them have already been massively suppressed by Big Tech. Even Fox News, which often parrots the establishment line but with a supposedly \"conservative\" spin, has found itself in the cross hairs of those demanding bans and censorship. And so there was an almost universal understanding, even among many liberals, that something would have to be done. But the question was and remains: What, if anything, can be done?</p><p>Flurry of Ideas on How to Respond</p><p>The ideas for what sort of response is needed were as numerous as they were varied. On one side, more than a few called for government intervention. Arguing that the Big Tech giants have become monopolies, the call to have government intervene was loud and clear from Congress and the White House to Main Street America. The companies' deep ties to government, too, have been cited to justify government intervention. On the other hand, countless voices urged conservatives, Christians, libertarians, nationalists, patriots, and all other victims of the Big Tech censorship machine to simply ditch the companies that hate them so much, or urged everyone to try out alternatives. And there are plenty. More on that below.</p><p>Among those calling for government to step in, there are several strategies being pursued. One of the key avenues involves the so-called Communications Decency Act. Essentially, under that 1996 statute, as long as companies act as politically neutral venues for others to post content, they are generally immune from liability over the content on their sites. For instance, if a Facebook user were to libel somebody or violate copyright, the company itself would not be liable for the speech. However, the same protections do not apply to companies that exercise editorial discretion in the content that appears on their platforms. As such, if a newspaper, for instance, libels a person, or steals another person's intellectual property, the paper would be liable under the law.</p><p>A number of high-profile lawmakers have jumped on this. At a Senate hearing in early 2018, Senator Ted Cruz (R~ Texas) began by asking representatives of the Internet giants - Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube - whether they consider themselves to be \"neutral\" in providing a forum for public discussion. All of them answered yes. But then Cruz highlighted the fact that a Twitter official was caught on hidden camera by Project Veritas investigators bragging about \"shadowbanning\" conservatives, a tactic that hides the victims' posts from others without the targeted individual even realizing that his content is not being seen by anyone. The senator from Texas also noted that Twitter initially blocked an announcement by Congressman Marsha Blackburn (RTenn.) due to the content being pro-life.</p><p>There are countless other examples. \"The pattern of political censorship we are seeing across the technology companies is highly concerning,\" Senator Cruz said in his closing remarks. \"And the opening question I asked of whether you are a neutral public forum - if you are a neutral public forum, that does not allow for political editorializing and censorship. And if you are not a neutral public forum, the entire predicate for liability immunity under the CDA [Communications Decency Act] is claiming to be a neutral public forum, so you cannot have it both ways.\" And indeed, as the purge of anti-establishment voices gets more and more extreme, countless prominent pundits and others have called for the Big Tech giants to lose their immunity under CDA. They are clearly biased against conservatives and Republicans - even the Left admits that.</p><p>Beyond the CDA, more than a few prominent voices, including plenty on the Left, have called for breaking up the Internet \"monopolies\" of Facebook, Google, YouTube, and so on by using antitrust statutes. Some heavy hitters have even argued that the Big Tech monopolies are more problematic than the old monopolies of the \"robber barons.\" James Delingpole at Breitbart, for instance, wrote: \"These Silicon Valley tech firms form the kind of oppressive, anti-consumer oligopoly that prompted Teddy Roosevelt's trust-busting in the early 20th century. The difference between Jeff Bezos and [John D.] Rockefeller is that whereas Rockefeller just controlled oil, Bezos and his ilk control 'ideas, information, perception of the world.'\" And it is even worse than that. \"Whatever threat these organizations pose to individual freedoms, the way they work in cahoots with governments is more dangerous still,\" Delingpole continued, calling on President Trump to step in and save Western civilization from the death of free speech being orchestrated by Big Tech and its totalitarian allies in Big Government all over the world.</p><p>More than a few people with Trump's ear are urging him to do that. Longtime Trump advisor and confidant Roger Stone, for instance, urged the administration to get involved. \"It is Internet freedom, it is the rise of a robust and vigorous alternative media through the Internet, that allowed Donald Trump to become president,\" said Stone, who works closely with Infowars. \"And now, his critics want to put the toothpaste back into the tube. They want to return to the days when only ABC, NBC, and CBS controlled the political dialogue. Trump's election would have been impossible under those circumstances.... We are being punished because we broadcast the truth. We are being shut down because we are a threat to the globalists and the Chinese Communist plan to take over this country.\" Warning that Infowars was just the beginning, Stone suggested that the Justice Department should use antitrust laws to end the political censorship by the Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>And Trump may be responding. In fact, in a number of posts on Twitter, Trump suggested that his administration was looking into Big Tech's war on free speech and would be taking action - especially concerning efforts to tip the election to Democrats. On July 26, Trump criticized Twitter in a tweet after it emerged that the website was making it more difficult for users to see posts of certain conservative lawmakers in Congress. \"Twitter 'SHADOW BANNING' prominent Republicans. Not good,\" Trump said. \"We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once. Many complaints.\" Since Jones and Infowars were banned, Trump has gone even further in terms of speaking out. And when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development went after Facebook for aiding and abetting discrimination in housing, more than a few of Facebook's foes celebrated.</p><p>Some opinion molders are advocating that the government create an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" that would protect free speech online. Investigative journalist and best-selling author Jerome Corsi, whose own YouTube channel was taken down before being put back online, told The New American that the status quo when it comes to social media is unacceptable. \"The mainstream media is desperately fighting for its survival,\" he said. \"And the way to do it is to get the social-media companies to throw out every other viewpoint.\" Noting that violent \"Antifa\" hate is welcome across the social-media platforms, while the Bible and support for the Second Amendment are increasingly being purged, Corsi said the establishment was trying to eliminate the visibility of views that are not aligned with its agenda.</p><p>While conservatives are typically reluctant to call for federal action, Corsi argued that it has now become hard to tell where the Internet giants end and the government begins. In particular, Corsi expressed frustration over the fact that the far-left leadership of the Internet companies was completely in bed with government and left-wing politicians such as the Clinton family. \"These companies are so penetrated by the intelligence agencies you wonder if they aren't just new names for the agencies,\" he said, noting that the U.S. government's intelligence apparatus had even funded many of the firms and was harvesting unfathomable amounts of data from them. \"When you get to the heart of what's going on in social media, it's an intelligence operation. That's what I was seeking to expose. This is no longer just a private enterprise.... Social media has become a backdoor for Big Brother.\"</p><p>Because of this intimate relationship with the government, and because the Big Tech firms could ramp up the purge ahead of the 2018 elections and swing the vote, Corsi said conservatives must recognize the danger and demand action. In particular, he said it was time for the government to step in and protect individual rights online. Along with touting an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" that would apply to the online world the free speech protections, due process protections, and protection from surveillance and datagathering without warrants contained in the U.S. Constitution, Corsi also called for antitrust investigations, which he said are more than warranted considering the companies' anti-competitive behavior. And finally, Corsi called for an official investigation into what these companies have been doing and the precise nature of their links to government. After all, if government built these companies - and it certainly helped, at the very least - then free-speech rights ought to be protected on their platforms, too, he argued.</p><p>Non-government Alternatives</p><p>Obviously, government involvement in regulating nominally private companies has plenty of critics among conservatives, libertarians, and constitutionalists. For one, a plain reading of the U.S. Constitution does not reveal any delegation of the authority required. Some critics even worry that such a move could be the proverbial camel's nose under the tent, letting government itself become empowered to control speech online. Plus, demanding that Christian bakers and florists celebrate homosexual \"marriages\" has left a horrible taste in many people's mouths - making the idea of forcing companies to host speech they disagree with seem particularly wrong. After all, the leftist mind can simultaneously believe that companies should be free to ban speech they dislike, but that Christians must celebrate what they consider evil or be destroyed. For conservatives, that smacks of liberal hypocrisy.</p><p>CEO Art Thompson with The John Birch Society, the constitutionalist grassroots organization that publishes this magazine, argued that entrepreneurs with a dedication to the truth over money must help create alternative spaces for free speech. \"The one solution to the problems of the Internet in a free society is competition,\" he said in an e-mail. \"More sites that sustain freedom of speech for all need to be produced, advertised, and used. People should intentionally seek out sites that - excepting pornography and the advocacy of a violent overthrow of the government - are committed to staying the course on free speech and would not willingly sell out their sites for megabucks.\"</p><p>\"When the First Amendment was drawn up, it only mentioned the two means of communication available at the time: speech and press,\" continued Thompson. \"Communication methods invented since then have all come under the regulation or control of the government in league with big-money businessmen who wish to use government to squash their competition, violating the original intent of the Bill of Rights. The two most obvious communication alternatives that were brought under government control were radio and television, which by 1970 were not only under the direction of the Federal Communications Commission but were basically consolidated and bought out by tycoons who were members of, or under the influence of, the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization that advocates global socialism (which is the control of everyone by a few handpicked bureaucrats under an organization such as the United Nations).\"</p><p>Thompson continued: \"Since the advent of the Internet, left-wing billionaires have been buying out most every new online site that reaches the masses, and government has been seeking to control it through so-called net neutrality. This is what I mean by staying the course and not succumbing to the allure of millions or billions of dollars, and serving the greater need for freedom of speech. The more voices open to free speech, the less likely they can tell be silenced.</p><p>Already, alternatives are popping up right and left. And people are using them, too. Among the emerging alternatives in the social-media space are companies such as Gab.ai, Minds, OneWay, Local Activist, MeWe, and more. Alternatives to YouTube that have received a major boost in recent weeks include BitChute and Real.Video. And in the search-engine market, a number of alternatives exist and are expanding quickly. These include DuckDuckGo, Searx.me, GoodGopher, StartPage, and more. Legacy alternatives such as Yahoo and Microsoft's Bing exist, too, although they suffer from many of the same problems as Google. Steemit and Patreon are providing alternative revenue sources for content creators - something crucial as YouTube works to bankrupt conservatives and enrich leftist-hatemongers-The-majore-mail providers are facing competition from privacy-oriented competitors such as ProluiiMail in Switzerland, which uses encryption to help users protect privacy, and many others. And even the Drudge Report, which constantly links to establishment propaganda but has traditionally been perceived as more friendly to conservatives and alternative voices, faces new competition from the fast-growing aggregator WhatFinger.com.</p><p>But changing services can be tough. Companies such as Google have become so pervasive that, to many, trying to cut ties with the increasingly \"evil\" giant seems hopeless. But Asia-focused freelancejournalist Nithin Coca did it, and shared his secrets with the world in a popular article about it. \"Today, I am Google free, part of the western world's ultimate digital minority, someone who does not use products from the world's two most valuable technology companies (yes, I don't use Facebook either),\" he explained. \"The truth is, alternatives do exist, many of which have launched in the years since Edward Snowden revealed Google's participation in Prism.\" And throughout the rest of the article, he provides a comprehensive list of all the alternative products and services he used to cut Google out of his life completely. It is well worth the read for anyone who is tired of being abused by the corporate Leviathan.</p><p>Some of the emerging alternatives are concerned that efforts to have Big Tech declared a \"public utility\" and the Internet subjected to more federal regulation would actually boost Big Tech's power permanently. In a letter to President Trump, OneWay.com President Derek Peterson, BitChute.com President Ray Vahey, and other tech leaders urged Trump not to have government barge in. \"We are very concerned that the actions of some of the bad actors in the technology world will result in regulations that could limit free speech and liberty in general,\" they wrote. \"We believe that the technologies we and others are developing will correct the market in a very short time and are concerned that any kind of regulation concerning speech or making these companies government sponsored 'public squares' or 'utilities' of some kind will further cement their place in our lives, make them more powerful and only make it more difficult or even impossible for the market to self correct.\" They basically asked the Trump administration to let the free market work, cut regulation, and adopt the technology as it is developed.</p><p>Author and technology expert Patrick Wood is right in the middle of all of it. As the author of Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation and editor of Technocracy News &amp; Trends, Wood understands the technocratic scheming of the globalist establishment. As the executive director of Citizens for Free Speech, he is deeply involved in the battle for free speech. But unlike those seeking federal solutions, Wood told The New American that the real answer is at the local level, in communities across America. That is why his organization is preparing to launch LocalActivist.org, a social-media service that aims to connect local activists with each other so they can see and post community events, join local groups that have been established for some specific local issue, and much more. The beta testing is already under way.</p><p>Commenting on the recent purges, Wood suggested Big Tech may be digging its own grave. \"All social-media companies are public corporations and inherently have the right to do whatever they desire, short of breaking the law,\" he explained. \"However, they are not immune to lawsuits from people who have been materially harmed by their actions, and I expect such lawsuits to proliferate. Censorship is not illegal, but socialmedia giants who practice it will now be forced to compete for ideas on the open stage of society. They are naively walking into a trap of their own making, and they will lose. Just like the NFL lost massive numbers of long-term viewers over player protests, social-media giants risk bringing the same kind of punishment upon themselves.... Technocrats that they are, they really don't realize that their ultimate fate is in the hands of the free market!\"</p><p>Of course, those companies are doing everything they can to suppress competition, even buying up or trying to cripple potential competitors before they can do too much damage. But even those machinations are running up against opposition. One of the increasingly prominent social-media platforms competing with Facebook is known as Minds.com. Not surprisingly, Google was quick to ban the company from its ad program. But Minds CEO Bill Ottman responded not by whining - although he was invited to air his concerns on one of TV's most popular news programs - but by announcing that his company was creating its own ad network to compete against the giants. It will use \"block-chain\" technology, which is all the rage in tech circles today, making it virtually impossible to manipulate or hack. And unlike the Big Tech companies, Minds' ad alternatives will be totally transparent, even using open-source code that anyone is welcome to inspect.</p><p>Speaking on Fox News' Tucker Carlson program, Minds CEO Ottman explained how Google was working to censor his company. Worse still, as Carlson noted, through their dominant position in online ads, Google and Facebook are able to have massive leverage over news sources and content creators - leverage that they frequently use, threatening and in some cases destroying alternative voices that refuse to do their bidding. Ottman said it is even worse than people realize, though. \"When you go to people's websites who host Google ads, Google is actually spying on you through those websites,\" Ottman explained after Carlson argued that the duopoly practically \"owns\" news sites by controlling the whole ad market. \"So by putting Google ads on your website, you're actually becoming an agent of Google. That's why we need transparent, more freedom-based ad platforms to emerge which don't spy on people.\" And that is what his company, Minds, is working to provide.</p><p>Truth Cannot Be Silenced</p><p>No matter how vigorously Big Tech and Big Government work to censor the truth, it cannot be totally suppressed. But that does not mean the establishment will not use dirty tricks in its efforts to try. Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and numerous other prominent voices even suggested that there may be an imminent false-flag attack against the media to be blamed on Trump, Infowars, and others. And indeed, with top United Nations officials suggesting that Trump could be prosecuted for \"incitement\" against the media if and when something bad happens, it is hardly far-fetched to suggest that the globalist establishment could be planning something. An incredible series of blatant lies against Jones and Trump pushed by the establishment, coinciding with the unprecedented and escalating purge of dissenting voices online, certainly suggests something fishy is going on.</p><p>But even without a false-flag attack, the threat of full-blown Internet censorship at the national and even the global level is very real. With Obama having surrendered control over Internet infrastructure to globalist \"stakeholders\" unbound by the First Amendment, and with the UN and many of its more oppressive member regimes actively campaigning for censorship worldwide, Internet freedom has never been in more grave danger. Key components of the Internet's architecture were transferred to \"international stakeholders,\" making it potentially feasible to literally wipe somebody off the Internet completely - not just off social media. And the UN installed an actual Chinese Communist (who claims censorship is in the eye of the beholder) at the top of the UN International Telecommunications Union, the agency currently being groomed by the establishment for the role of world Internet regulator and censor. If the Orwellian trends are not halted, it could be just a matter of time before the World Wide Web faces fullblown_censorship by a rogue alliance of _ governments, dictators, international institutions, and their Big Business cronies.</p><p>But ultimately, even if the Internet is completely undermined as an effective means of educating and activating resistance to the establishment and its agenda, the fight for truth and against tyranny must go on. The John Birch Society has been leading the effort to save diminishing freedoms since the late 1950s - generations before the Internet was even born. Tools for accomplishing that included and still include printed publications, videos and DVDs, grassroots educational campaigns, public speeches to educate local communities and opinion molders, and much more. And despite the emergence of the Internet, these tools are still far from obsolete. If, somehow, the establishment manages to shut down the World Wide Web as a useful tool to disseminate the truth, The John Birch Society will continue to get the information out. And you can help. Get involved, or get more involved, today! *</p><p>For now, Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube) dominate the online advertising market, creating a sort of Internet ad duopoly that controls an estimated 75 percent of the digital advertising market.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2113740415</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9S-4XS1-DY0W-43S6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4278\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Sep 17, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

But by 2016, after becoming essentially monopolies with help from the feds and the Deep State establishment, they began to roll out full-blown censorship and surveillance, while manipulating what users see. In short, companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Alphabet (which owns YouTube and Google), and many more deceived their users. And now that they think they are indispensable to humanity and unstoppable, they shut the trap door, with conservatives on the outside looking in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the battle is far from finished. And as the reality of Big Government and Big Tech colluding together to manipulate humanity and promote propaganda becomes increasingly obvious, alternatives are emerging quickly. Plus, with the demand for truth growing across America and worldwide, it seems highly likely that suppliers will continue finding ways to supply it.</p><p>For now, Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube) dominate the online advertising market, creating a sort of Internet ad duopoly that controls an estimated 75 percent of the digital advertising market. Already, though, a dizzying array of alternatives to the Big Tech giants has started to emerge. From new search engines to new social-media services, the number of options is multiplying quickly. Many of the options are decentralized and innovative, marking a sharp departure from the centralized top-down control of existing technology giants. More will be coming soon. And while plenty may eventually fade into obscurity, some are already enjoying incredible growth. Plus, every minute that a user spends on an alternative company's website means less advertising dollars for the tech giants - and less data on users to analyze, monetize, and, eventually, weaponize.</p><p>Obviously, corporate silencing of dissent is not the only troubling element of the Big Tech giants. At the top of concerns for users is privacy. And with new scandals about abuses of privacy emerging on a continual basis, a growing number of people are voting with their digital devices and using alternatives. In late July, Facebook lost $120 billion in value in one day - about 20 percent of the company's market capitalization - setting a new record in stock-market history. And that incredible sell-off was caused, in part at least, by \"reduced use,\" with users spending less time on the platform and user growth slowing dramatically. In early 2018, Facebook announced its firstever decline in daily U.S. users. With the company making a deliberate decision to purge conservatives, there may be more downside still to come.</p><p>But many fear the wrath of the tech giants. In fact, as the reality of the accelerating purge became impossible to ignore once Alex Jones and Infowars were \"de-platformed,\" a sort of \"panic\" set in among some contrarian voices. After all, if they could take down a media empire with many millions of staunchly loyal supporters and links to the White House, they could take down anybody. The New American magazine, Breitbart, WND, Drudge, or any other conservative site could easily go down too - in fact, all of them have already been massively suppressed by Big Tech. Even Fox News, which often parrots the establishment line but with a supposedly \"conservative\" spin, has found itself in the cross hairs of those demanding bans and censorship. And so there was an almost universal understanding, even among many liberals, that something would have to be done. But the question was and remains: What, if anything, can be done?</p><p>Flurry of Ideas on How to Respond</p><p>The ideas for what sort of response is needed were as numerous as they were varied. On one side, more than a few called for government intervention. Arguing that the Big Tech giants have become monopolies, the call to have government intervene was loud and clear from Congress and the White House to Main Street America. The companies' deep ties to government, too, have been cited to justify government intervention. On the other hand, countless voices urged conservatives, Christians, libertarians, nationalists, patriots, and all other victims of the Big Tech censorship machine to simply ditch the companies that hate them so much, or urged everyone to try out alternatives. And there are plenty. More on that below.</p><p>Among those calling for government to step in, there are several strategies being pursued. One of the key avenues involves the so-called Communications Decency Act. Essentially, under that 1996 statute, as long as companies act as politically neutral venues for others to post content, they are generally immune from liability over the content on their sites. For instance, if a Facebook user were to libel somebody or violate copyright, the company itself would not be liable for the speech. However, the same protections do not apply to companies that exercise editorial discretion in the content that appears on their platforms. As such, if a newspaper, for instance, libels a person, or steals another person's intellectual property, the paper would be liable under the law.</p><p>A number of high-profile lawmakers have jumped on this. At a Senate hearing in early 2018, Senator Ted Cruz (R~ Texas) began by asking representatives of the Internet giants - Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube - whether they consider themselves to be \"neutral\" in providing a forum for public discussion. All of them answered yes. But then Cruz highlighted the fact that a Twitter official was caught on hidden camera by Project Veritas investigators bragging about \"shadowbanning\" conservatives, a tactic that hides the victims' posts from others without the targeted individual even realizing that his content is not being seen by anyone. The senator from Texas also noted that Twitter initially blocked an announcement by Congressman Marsha Blackburn (RTenn.) due to the content being pro-life.</p><p>There are countless other examples. \"The pattern of political censorship we are seeing across the technology companies is highly concerning,\" Senator Cruz said in his closing remarks. \"And the opening question I asked of whether you are a neutral public forum - if you are a neutral public forum, that does not allow for political editorializing and censorship. And if you are not a neutral public forum, the entire predicate for liability immunity under the CDA [Communications Decency Act] is claiming to be a neutral public forum, so you cannot have it both ways.\" And indeed, as the purge of anti-establishment voices gets more and more extreme, countless prominent pundits and others have called for the Big Tech giants to lose their immunity under CDA. They are clearly biased against conservatives and Republicans - even the Left admits that.</p><p>Beyond the CDA, more than a few prominent voices, including plenty on the Left, have called for breaking up the Internet \"monopolies\" of Facebook, Google, YouTube, and so on by using antitrust statutes. Some heavy hitters have even argued that the Big Tech monopolies are more problematic than the old monopolies of the \"robber barons.\" James Delingpole at Breitbart, for instance, wrote: \"These Silicon Valley tech firms form the kind of oppressive, anti-consumer oligopoly that prompted Teddy Roosevelt's trust-busting in the early 20th century. The difference between Jeff Bezos and [John D.] Rockefeller is that whereas Rockefeller just controlled oil, Bezos and his ilk control 'ideas, information, perception of the world.'\" And it is even worse than that. \"Whatever threat these organizations pose to individual freedoms, the way they work in cahoots with governments is more dangerous still,\" Delingpole continued, calling on President Trump to step in and save Western civilization from the death of free speech being orchestrated by Big Tech and its totalitarian allies in Big Government all over the world.</p><p>More than a few people with Trump's ear are urging him to do that. Longtime Trump advisor and confidant Roger Stone, for instance, urged the administration to get involved. \"It is Internet freedom, it is the rise of a robust and vigorous alternative media through the Internet, that allowed Donald Trump to become president,\" said Stone, who works closely with Infowars. \"And now, his critics want to put the toothpaste back into the tube. They want to return to the days when only ABC, NBC, and CBS controlled the political dialogue. Trump's election would have been impossible under those circumstances.... We are being punished because we broadcast the truth. We are being shut down because we are a threat to the globalists and the Chinese Communist plan to take over this country.\" Warning that Infowars was just the beginning, Stone suggested that the Justice Department should use antitrust laws to end the political censorship by the Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>And Trump may be responding. In fact, in a number of posts on Twitter, Trump suggested that his administration was looking into Big Tech's war on free speech and would be taking action - especially concerning efforts to tip the election to Democrats. On July 26, Trump criticized Twitter in a tweet after it emerged that the website was making it more difficult for users to see posts of certain conservative lawmakers in Congress. \"Twitter 'SHADOW BANNING' prominent Republicans. Not good,\" Trump said. \"We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once. Many complaints.\" Since Jones and Infowars were banned, Trump has gone even further in terms of speaking out. And when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development went after Facebook for aiding and abetting discrimination in housing, more than a few of Facebook's foes celebrated.</p><p>Some opinion molders are advocating that the government create an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" that would protect free speech online. Investigative journalist and best-selling author Jerome Corsi, whose own YouTube channel was taken down before being put back online, told The New American that the status quo when it comes to social media is unacceptable. \"The mainstream media is desperately fighting for its survival,\" he said. \"And the way to do it is to get the social-media companies to throw out every other viewpoint.\" Noting that violent \"Antifa\" hate is welcome across the social-media platforms, while the Bible and support for the Second Amendment are increasingly being purged, Corsi said the establishment was trying to eliminate the visibility of views that are not aligned with its agenda.</p><p>While conservatives are typically reluctant to call for federal action, Corsi argued that it has now become hard to tell where the Internet giants end and the government begins. In particular, Corsi expressed frustration over the fact that the far-left leadership of the Internet companies was completely in bed with government and left-wing politicians such as the Clinton family. \"These companies are so penetrated by the intelligence agencies you wonder if they aren't just new names for the agencies,\" he said, noting that the U.S. government's intelligence apparatus had even funded many of the firms and was harvesting unfathomable amounts of data from them. \"When you get to the heart of what's going on in social media, it's an intelligence operation. That's what I was seeking to expose. This is no longer just a private enterprise.... Social media has become a backdoor for Big Brother.\"</p><p>Because of this intimate relationship with the government, and because the Big Tech firms could ramp up the purge ahead of the 2018 elections and swing the vote, Corsi said conservatives must recognize the danger and demand action. In particular, he said it was time for the government to step in and protect individual rights online. Along with touting an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" that would apply to the online world the free speech protections, due process protections, and protection from surveillance and datagathering without warrants contained in the U.S. Constitution, Corsi also called for antitrust investigations, which he said are more than warranted considering the companies' anti-competitive behavior. And finally, Corsi called for an official investigation into what these companies have been doing and the precise nature of their links to government. After all, if government built these companies - and it certainly helped, at the very least - then free-speech rights ought to be protected on their platforms, too, he argued.</p><p>Non-government Alternatives</p><p>Obviously, government involvement in regulating nominally private companies has plenty of critics among conservatives, libertarians, and constitutionalists. For one, a plain reading of the U.S. Constitution does not reveal any delegation of the authority required. Some critics even worry that such a move could be the proverbial camel's nose under the tent, letting government itself become empowered to control speech online. Plus, demanding that Christian bakers and florists celebrate homosexual \"marriages\" has left a horrible taste in many people's mouths - making the idea of forcing companies to host speech they disagree with seem particularly wrong. After all, the leftist mind can simultaneously believe that companies should be free to ban speech they dislike, but that Christians must celebrate what they consider evil or be destroyed. For conservatives, that smacks of liberal hypocrisy.</p><p>CEO Art Thompson with The John Birch Society, the constitutionalist grassroots organization that publishes this magazine, argued that entrepreneurs with a dedication to the truth over money must help create alternative spaces for free speech. \"The one solution to the problems of the Internet in a free society is competition,\" he said in an e-mail. \"More sites that sustain freedom of speech for all need to be produced, advertised, and used. People should intentionally seek out sites that - excepting pornography and the advocacy of a violent overthrow of the government - are committed to staying the course on free speech and would not willingly sell out their sites for megabucks.\"</p><p>\"When the First Amendment was drawn up, it only mentioned the two means of communication available at the time: speech and press,\" continued Thompson. \"Communication methods invented since then have all come under the regulation or control of the government in league with big-money businessmen who wish to use government to squash their competition, violating the original intent of the Bill of Rights. The two most obvious communication alternatives that were brought under government control were radio and television, which by 1970 were not only under the direction of the Federal Communications Commission but were basically consolidated and bought out by tycoons who were members of, or under the influence of, the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization that advocates global socialism (which is the control of everyone by a few handpicked bureaucrats under an organization such as the United Nations).\"</p><p>Thompson continued: \"Since the advent of the Internet, left-wing billionaires have been buying out most every new online site that reaches the masses, and government has been seeking to control it through so-called net neutrality. This is what I mean by staying the course and not succumbing to the allure of millions or billions of dollars, and serving the greater need for freedom of speech. The more voices open to free speech, the less likely they can tell be silenced.</p><p>Already, alternatives are popping up right and left. And people are using them, too. Among the emerging alternatives in the social-media space are companies such as Gab.ai, Minds, OneWay, Local Activist, MeWe, and more. Alternatives to YouTube that have received a major boost in recent weeks include BitChute and Real.Video. And in the search-engine market, a number of alternatives exist and are expanding quickly. These include DuckDuckGo, Searx.me, GoodGopher, StartPage, and more. Legacy alternatives such as Yahoo and Microsoft's Bing exist, too, although they suffer from many of the same problems as Google. Steemit and Patreon are providing alternative revenue sources for content creators - something crucial as YouTube works to bankrupt conservatives and enrich leftist-hatemongers-The-majore-mail providers are facing competition from privacy-oriented competitors such as ProluiiMail in Switzerland, which uses encryption to help users protect privacy, and many others. And even the Drudge Report, which constantly links to establishment propaganda but has traditionally been perceived as more friendly to conservatives and alternative voices, faces new competition from the fast-growing aggregator WhatFinger.com.</p><p>But changing services can be tough. Companies such as Google have become so pervasive that, to many, trying to cut ties with the increasingly \"evil\" giant seems hopeless. But Asia-focused freelancejournalist Nithin Coca did it, and shared his secrets with the world in a popular article about it. \"Today, I am Google free, part of the western world's ultimate digital minority, someone who does not use products from the world's two most valuable technology companies (yes, I don't use Facebook either),\" he explained. \"The truth is, alternatives do exist, many of which have launched in the years since Edward Snowden revealed Google's participation in Prism.\" And throughout the rest of the article, he provides a comprehensive list of all the alternative products and services he used to cut Google out of his life completely. It is well worth the read for anyone who is tired of being abused by the corporate Leviathan.</p><p>Some of the emerging alternatives are concerned that efforts to have Big Tech declared a \"public utility\" and the Internet subjected to more federal regulation would actually boost Big Tech's power permanently. In a letter to President Trump, OneWay.com President Derek Peterson, BitChute.com President Ray Vahey, and other tech leaders urged Trump not to have government barge in. \"We are very concerned that the actions of some of the bad actors in the technology world will result in regulations that could limit free speech and liberty in general,\" they wrote. \"We believe that the technologies we and others are developing will correct the market in a very short time and are concerned that any kind of regulation concerning speech or making these companies government sponsored 'public squares' or 'utilities' of some kind will further cement their place in our lives, make them more powerful and only make it more difficult or even impossible for the market to self correct.\" They basically asked the Trump administration to let the free market work, cut regulation, and adopt the technology as it is developed.</p><p>Author and technology expert Patrick Wood is right in the middle of all of it. As the author of Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation and editor of Technocracy News &amp; Trends, Wood understands the technocratic scheming of the globalist establishment. As the executive director of Citizens for Free Speech, he is deeply involved in the battle for free speech. But unlike those seeking federal solutions, Wood told The New American that the real answer is at the local level, in communities across America. That is why his organization is preparing to launch LocalActivist.org, a social-media service that aims to connect local activists with each other so they can see and post community events, join local groups that have been established for some specific local issue, and much more. The beta testing is already under way.</p><p>Commenting on the recent purges, Wood suggested Big Tech may be digging its own grave. \"All social-media companies are public corporations and inherently have the right to do whatever they desire, short of breaking the law,\" he explained. \"However, they are not immune to lawsuits from people who have been materially harmed by their actions, and I expect such lawsuits to proliferate. Censorship is not illegal, but socialmedia giants who practice it will now be forced to compete for ideas on the open stage of society. They are naively walking into a trap of their own making, and they will lose. Just like the NFL lost massive numbers of long-term viewers over player protests, social-media giants risk bringing the same kind of punishment upon themselves.... Technocrats that they are, they really don't realize that their ultimate fate is in the hands of the free market!\"</p><p>Of course, those companies are doing everything they can to suppress competition, even buying up or trying to cripple potential competitors before they can do too much damage. But even those machinations are running up against opposition. One of the increasingly prominent social-media platforms competing with Facebook is known as Minds.com. Not surprisingly, Google was quick to ban the company from its ad program. But Minds CEO Bill Ottman responded not by whining - although he was invited to air his concerns on one of TV's most popular news programs - but by announcing that his company was creating its own ad network to compete against the giants. It will use \"block-chain\" technology, which is all the rage in tech circles today, making it virtually impossible to manipulate or hack. And unlike the Big Tech companies, Minds' ad alternatives will be totally transparent, even using open-source code that anyone is welcome to inspect.</p><p>Speaking on Fox News' Tucker Carlson program, Minds CEO Ottman explained how Google was working to censor his company. Worse still, as Carlson noted, through their dominant position in online ads, Google and Facebook are able to have massive leverage over news sources and content creators - leverage that they frequently use, threatening and in some cases destroying alternative voices that refuse to do their bidding. Ottman said it is even worse than people realize, though. \"When you go to people's websites who host Google ads, Google is actually spying on you through those websites,\" Ottman explained after Carlson argued that the duopoly practically \"owns\" news sites by controlling the whole ad market. \"So by putting Google ads on your website, you're actually becoming an agent of Google. That's why we need transparent, more freedom-based ad platforms to emerge which don't spy on people.\" And that is what his company, Minds, is working to provide.</p><p>Truth Cannot Be Silenced</p><p>No matter how vigorously Big Tech and Big Government work to censor the truth, it cannot be totally suppressed. But that does not mean the establishment will not use dirty tricks in its efforts to try. Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and numerous other prominent voices even suggested that there may be an imminent false-flag attack against the media to be blamed on Trump, Infowars, and others. And indeed, with top United Nations officials suggesting that Trump could be prosecuted for \"incitement\" against the media if and when something bad happens, it is hardly far-fetched to suggest that the globalist establishment could be planning something. An incredible series of blatant lies against Jones and Trump pushed by the establishment, coinciding with the unprecedented and escalating purge of dissenting voices online, certainly suggests something fishy is going on.</p><p>But even without a false-flag attack, the threat of full-blown Internet censorship at the national and even the global level is very real. With Obama having surrendered control over Internet infrastructure to globalist \"stakeholders\" unbound by the First Amendment, and with the UN and many of its more oppressive member regimes actively campaigning for censorship worldwide, Internet freedom has never been in more grave danger. Key components of the Internet's architecture were transferred to \"international stakeholders,\" making it potentially feasible to literally wipe somebody off the Internet completely - not just off social media. And the UN installed an actual Chinese Communist (who claims censorship is in the eye of the beholder) at the top of the UN International Telecommunications Union, the agency currently being groomed by the establishment for the role of world Internet regulator and censor. If the Orwellian trends are not halted, it could be just a matter of time before the World Wide Web faces fullblown_censorship by a rogue alliance of _ governments, dictators, international institutions, and their Big Business cronies.</p><p>But ultimately, even if the Internet is completely undermined as an effective means of educating and activating resistance to the establishment and its agenda, the fight for truth and against tyranny must go on. The John Birch Society has been leading the effort to save diminishing freedoms since the late 1950s - generations before the Internet was even born. Tools for accomplishing that included and still include printed publications, videos and DVDs, grassroots educational campaigns, public speeches to educate local communities and opinion molders, and much more. And despite the emergence of the Internet, these tools are still far from obsolete. If, somehow, the establishment manages to shut down the World Wide Web as a useful tool to disseminate the truth, The John Birch Society will continue to get the information out. And you can help. Get involved, or get more involved, today! *</p><p>For now, Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube) dominate the online advertising market, creating a sort of Internet ad duopoly that controls an estimated 75 percent of the digital advertising market.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2113740415</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCJ-3V71-JBHT-D2B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4278\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Sep 17, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

But by 2016, after becoming essentially monopolies with help from the feds and the Deep State establishment, they began to roll out full-blown censorship and surveillance, while manipulating what users see. In short, companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Alphabet (which owns YouTube and Google), and many more deceived their users. And now that they think they are indispensable to humanity and unstoppable, they shut the trap door, with conservatives on the outside looking in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the battle is far from finished. And as the reality of Big Government and Big Tech colluding together to manipulate humanity and promote propaganda becomes increasingly obvious, alternatives are emerging quickly. Plus, with the demand for truth growing across America and worldwide, it seems highly likely that suppliers will continue finding ways to supply it.</p><p>For now, Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube) dominate the online advertising market, creating a sort of Internet ad duopoly that controls an estimated 75 percent of the digital advertising market. Already, though, a dizzying array of alternatives to the Big Tech giants has started to emerge. From new search engines to new social-media services, the number of options is multiplying quickly. Many of the options are decentralized and innovative, marking a sharp departure from the centralized top-down control of existing technology giants. More will be coming soon. And while plenty may eventually fade into obscurity, some are already enjoying incredible growth. Plus, every minute that a user spends on an alternative company's website means less advertising dollars for the tech giants - and less data on users to analyze, monetize, and, eventually, weaponize.</p><p>Obviously, corporate silencing of dissent is not the only troubling element of the Big Tech giants. At the top of concerns for users is privacy. And with new scandals about abuses of privacy emerging on a continual basis, a growing number of people are voting with their digital devices and using alternatives. In late July, Facebook lost $120 billion in value in one day - about 20 percent of the company's market capitalization - setting a new record in stock-market history. And that incredible sell-off was caused, in part at least, by \"reduced use,\" with users spending less time on the platform and user growth slowing dramatically. In early 2018, Facebook announced its firstever decline in daily U.S. users. With the company making a deliberate decision to purge conservatives, there may be more downside still to come.</p><p>But many fear the wrath of the tech giants. In fact, as the reality of the accelerating purge became impossible to ignore once Alex Jones and Infowars were \"de-platformed,\" a sort of \"panic\" set in among some contrarian voices. After all, if they could take down a media empire with many millions of staunchly loyal supporters and links to the White House, they could take down anybody. The New American magazine, Breitbart, WND, Drudge, or any other conservative site could easily go down too - in fact, all of them have already been massively suppressed by Big Tech. Even Fox News, which often parrots the establishment line but with a supposedly \"conservative\" spin, has found itself in the cross hairs of those demanding bans and censorship. And so there was an almost universal understanding, even among many liberals, that something would have to be done. But the question was and remains: What, if anything, can be done?</p><p>Flurry of Ideas on How to Respond</p><p>The ideas for what sort of response is needed were as numerous as they were varied. On one side, more than a few called for government intervention. Arguing that the Big Tech giants have become monopolies, the call to have government intervene was loud and clear from Congress and the White House to Main Street America. The companies' deep ties to government, too, have been cited to justify government intervention. On the other hand, countless voices urged conservatives, Christians, libertarians, nationalists, patriots, and all other victims of the Big Tech censorship machine to simply ditch the companies that hate them so much, or urged everyone to try out alternatives. And there are plenty. More on that below.</p><p>Among those calling for government to step in, there are several strategies being pursued. One of the key avenues involves the so-called Communications Decency Act. Essentially, under that 1996 statute, as long as companies act as politically neutral venues for others to post content, they are generally immune from liability over the content on their sites. For instance, if a Facebook user were to libel somebody or violate copyright, the company itself would not be liable for the speech. However, the same protections do not apply to companies that exercise editorial discretion in the content that appears on their platforms. As such, if a newspaper, for instance, libels a person, or steals another person's intellectual property, the paper would be liable under the law.</p><p>A number of high-profile lawmakers have jumped on this. At a Senate hearing in early 2018, Senator Ted Cruz (R~ Texas) began by asking representatives of the Internet giants - Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube - whether they consider themselves to be \"neutral\" in providing a forum for public discussion. All of them answered yes. But then Cruz highlighted the fact that a Twitter official was caught on hidden camera by Project Veritas investigators bragging about \"shadowbanning\" conservatives, a tactic that hides the victims' posts from others without the targeted individual even realizing that his content is not being seen by anyone. The senator from Texas also noted that Twitter initially blocked an announcement by Congressman Marsha Blackburn (RTenn.) due to the content being pro-life.</p><p>There are countless other examples. \"The pattern of political censorship we are seeing across the technology companies is highly concerning,\" Senator Cruz said in his closing remarks. \"And the opening question I asked of whether you are a neutral public forum - if you are a neutral public forum, that does not allow for political editorializing and censorship. And if you are not a neutral public forum, the entire predicate for liability immunity under the CDA [Communications Decency Act] is claiming to be a neutral public forum, so you cannot have it both ways.\" And indeed, as the purge of anti-establishment voices gets more and more extreme, countless prominent pundits and others have called for the Big Tech giants to lose their immunity under CDA. They are clearly biased against conservatives and Republicans - even the Left admits that.</p><p>Beyond the CDA, more than a few prominent voices, including plenty on the Left, have called for breaking up the Internet \"monopolies\" of Facebook, Google, YouTube, and so on by using antitrust statutes. Some heavy hitters have even argued that the Big Tech monopolies are more problematic than the old monopolies of the \"robber barons.\" James Delingpole at Breitbart, for instance, wrote: \"These Silicon Valley tech firms form the kind of oppressive, anti-consumer oligopoly that prompted Teddy Roosevelt's trust-busting in the early 20th century. The difference between Jeff Bezos and [John D.] Rockefeller is that whereas Rockefeller just controlled oil, Bezos and his ilk control 'ideas, information, perception of the world.'\" And it is even worse than that. \"Whatever threat these organizations pose to individual freedoms, the way they work in cahoots with governments is more dangerous still,\" Delingpole continued, calling on President Trump to step in and save Western civilization from the death of free speech being orchestrated by Big Tech and its totalitarian allies in Big Government all over the world.</p><p>More than a few people with Trump's ear are urging him to do that. Longtime Trump advisor and confidant Roger Stone, for instance, urged the administration to get involved. \"It is Internet freedom, it is the rise of a robust and vigorous alternative media through the Internet, that allowed Donald Trump to become president,\" said Stone, who works closely with Infowars. \"And now, his critics want to put the toothpaste back into the tube. They want to return to the days when only ABC, NBC, and CBS controlled the political dialogue. Trump's election would have been impossible under those circumstances.... We are being punished because we broadcast the truth. We are being shut down because we are a threat to the globalists and the Chinese Communist plan to take over this country.\" Warning that Infowars was just the beginning, Stone suggested that the Justice Department should use antitrust laws to end the political censorship by the Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>And Trump may be responding. In fact, in a number of posts on Twitter, Trump suggested that his administration was looking into Big Tech's war on free speech and would be taking action - especially concerning efforts to tip the election to Democrats. On July 26, Trump criticized Twitter in a tweet after it emerged that the website was making it more difficult for users to see posts of certain conservative lawmakers in Congress. \"Twitter 'SHADOW BANNING' prominent Republicans. Not good,\" Trump said. \"We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once. Many complaints.\" Since Jones and Infowars were banned, Trump has gone even further in terms of speaking out. And when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development went after Facebook for aiding and abetting discrimination in housing, more than a few of Facebook's foes celebrated.</p><p>Some opinion molders are advocating that the government create an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" that would protect free speech online. Investigative journalist and best-selling author Jerome Corsi, whose own YouTube channel was taken down before being put back online, told The New American that the status quo when it comes to social media is unacceptable. \"The mainstream media is desperately fighting for its survival,\" he said. \"And the way to do it is to get the social-media companies to throw out every other viewpoint.\" Noting that violent \"Antifa\" hate is welcome across the social-media platforms, while the Bible and support for the Second Amendment are increasingly being purged, Corsi said the establishment was trying to eliminate the visibility of views that are not aligned with its agenda.</p><p>While conservatives are typically reluctant to call for federal action, Corsi argued that it has now become hard to tell where the Internet giants end and the government begins. In particular, Corsi expressed frustration over the fact that the far-left leadership of the Internet companies was completely in bed with government and left-wing politicians such as the Clinton family. \"These companies are so penetrated by the intelligence agencies you wonder if they aren't just new names for the agencies,\" he said, noting that the U.S. government's intelligence apparatus had even funded many of the firms and was harvesting unfathomable amounts of data from them. \"When you get to the heart of what's going on in social media, it's an intelligence operation. That's what I was seeking to expose. This is no longer just a private enterprise.... Social media has become a backdoor for Big Brother.\"</p><p>Because of this intimate relationship with the government, and because the Big Tech firms could ramp up the purge ahead of the 2018 elections and swing the vote, Corsi said conservatives must recognize the danger and demand action. In particular, he said it was time for the government to step in and protect individual rights online. Along with touting an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" that would apply to the online world the free speech protections, due process protections, and protection from surveillance and datagathering without warrants contained in the U.S. Constitution, Corsi also called for antitrust investigations, which he said are more than warranted considering the companies' anti-competitive behavior. And finally, Corsi called for an official investigation into what these companies have been doing and the precise nature of their links to government. After all, if government built these companies - and it certainly helped, at the very least - then free-speech rights ought to be protected on their platforms, too, he argued.</p><p>Non-government Alternatives</p><p>Obviously, government involvement in regulating nominally private companies has plenty of critics among conservatives, libertarians, and constitutionalists. For one, a plain reading of the U.S. Constitution does not reveal any delegation of the authority required. Some critics even worry that such a move could be the proverbial camel's nose under the tent, letting government itself become empowered to control speech online. Plus, demanding that Christian bakers and florists celebrate homosexual \"marriages\" has left a horrible taste in many people's mouths - making the idea of forcing companies to host speech they disagree with seem particularly wrong. After all, the leftist mind can simultaneously believe that companies should be free to ban speech they dislike, but that Christians must celebrate what they consider evil or be destroyed. For conservatives, that smacks of liberal hypocrisy.</p><p>CEO Art Thompson with The John Birch Society, the constitutionalist grassroots organization that publishes this magazine, argued that entrepreneurs with a dedication to the truth over money must help create alternative spaces for free speech. \"The one solution to the problems of the Internet in a free society is competition,\" he said in an e-mail. \"More sites that sustain freedom of speech for all need to be produced, advertised, and used. People should intentionally seek out sites that - excepting pornography and the advocacy of a violent overthrow of the government - are committed to staying the course on free speech and would not willingly sell out their sites for megabucks.\"</p><p>\"When the First Amendment was drawn up, it only mentioned the two means of communication available at the time: speech and press,\" continued Thompson. \"Communication methods invented since then have all come under the regulation or control of the government in league with big-money businessmen who wish to use government to squash their competition, violating the original intent of the Bill of Rights. The two most obvious communication alternatives that were brought under government control were radio and television, which by 1970 were not only under the direction of the Federal Communications Commission but were basically consolidated and bought out by tycoons who were members of, or under the influence of, the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization that advocates global socialism (which is the control of everyone by a few handpicked bureaucrats under an organization such as the United Nations).\"</p><p>Thompson continued: \"Since the advent of the Internet, left-wing billionaires have been buying out most every new online site that reaches the masses, and government has been seeking to control it through so-called net neutrality. This is what I mean by staying the course and not succumbing to the allure of millions or billions of dollars, and serving the greater need for freedom of speech. The more voices open to free speech, the less likely they can tell be silenced.</p><p>Already, alternatives are popping up right and left. And people are using them, too. Among the emerging alternatives in the social-media space are companies such as Gab.ai, Minds, OneWay, Local Activist, MeWe, and more. Alternatives to YouTube that have received a major boost in recent weeks include BitChute and Real.Video. And in the search-engine market, a number of alternatives exist and are expanding quickly. These include DuckDuckGo, Searx.me, GoodGopher, StartPage, and more. Legacy alternatives such as Yahoo and Microsoft's Bing exist, too, although they suffer from many of the same problems as Google. Steemit and Patreon are providing alternative revenue sources for content creators - something crucial as YouTube works to bankrupt conservatives and enrich leftist-hatemongers-The-majore-mail providers are facing competition from privacy-oriented competitors such as ProluiiMail in Switzerland, which uses encryption to help users protect privacy, and many others. And even the Drudge Report, which constantly links to establishment propaganda but has traditionally been perceived as more friendly to conservatives and alternative voices, faces new competition from the fast-growing aggregator WhatFinger.com.</p><p>But changing services can be tough. Companies such as Google have become so pervasive that, to many, trying to cut ties with the increasingly \"evil\" giant seems hopeless. But Asia-focused freelancejournalist Nithin Coca did it, and shared his secrets with the world in a popular article about it. \"Today, I am Google free, part of the western world's ultimate digital minority, someone who does not use products from the world's two most valuable technology companies (yes, I don't use Facebook either),\" he explained. \"The truth is, alternatives do exist, many of which have launched in the years since Edward Snowden revealed Google's participation in Prism.\" And throughout the rest of the article, he provides a comprehensive list of all the alternative products and services he used to cut Google out of his life completely. It is well worth the read for anyone who is tired of being abused by the corporate Leviathan.</p><p>Some of the emerging alternatives are concerned that efforts to have Big Tech declared a \"public utility\" and the Internet subjected to more federal regulation would actually boost Big Tech's power permanently. In a letter to President Trump, OneWay.com President Derek Peterson, BitChute.com President Ray Vahey, and other tech leaders urged Trump not to have government barge in. \"We are very concerned that the actions of some of the bad actors in the technology world will result in regulations that could limit free speech and liberty in general,\" they wrote. \"We believe that the technologies we and others are developing will correct the market in a very short time and are concerned that any kind of regulation concerning speech or making these companies government sponsored 'public squares' or 'utilities' of some kind will further cement their place in our lives, make them more powerful and only make it more difficult or even impossible for the market to self correct.\" They basically asked the Trump administration to let the free market work, cut regulation, and adopt the technology as it is developed.</p><p>Author and technology expert Patrick Wood is right in the middle of all of it. As the author of Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation and editor of Technocracy News &amp; Trends, Wood understands the technocratic scheming of the globalist establishment. As the executive director of Citizens for Free Speech, he is deeply involved in the battle for free speech. But unlike those seeking federal solutions, Wood told The New American that the real answer is at the local level, in communities across America. That is why his organization is preparing to launch LocalActivist.org, a social-media service that aims to connect local activists with each other so they can see and post community events, join local groups that have been established for some specific local issue, and much more. The beta testing is already under way.</p><p>Commenting on the recent purges, Wood suggested Big Tech may be digging its own grave. \"All social-media companies are public corporations and inherently have the right to do whatever they desire, short of breaking the law,\" he explained. \"However, they are not immune to lawsuits from people who have been materially harmed by their actions, and I expect such lawsuits to proliferate. Censorship is not illegal, but socialmedia giants who practice it will now be forced to compete for ideas on the open stage of society. They are naively walking into a trap of their own making, and they will lose. Just like the NFL lost massive numbers of long-term viewers over player protests, social-media giants risk bringing the same kind of punishment upon themselves.... Technocrats that they are, they really don't realize that their ultimate fate is in the hands of the free market!\"</p><p>Of course, those companies are doing everything they can to suppress competition, even buying up or trying to cripple potential competitors before they can do too much damage. But even those machinations are running up against opposition. One of the increasingly prominent social-media platforms competing with Facebook is known as Minds.com. Not surprisingly, Google was quick to ban the company from its ad program. But Minds CEO Bill Ottman responded not by whining - although he was invited to air his concerns on one of TV's most popular news programs - but by announcing that his company was creating its own ad network to compete against the giants. It will use \"block-chain\" technology, which is all the rage in tech circles today, making it virtually impossible to manipulate or hack. And unlike the Big Tech companies, Minds' ad alternatives will be totally transparent, even using open-source code that anyone is welcome to inspect.</p><p>Speaking on Fox News' Tucker Carlson program, Minds CEO Ottman explained how Google was working to censor his company. Worse still, as Carlson noted, through their dominant position in online ads, Google and Facebook are able to have massive leverage over news sources and content creators - leverage that they frequently use, threatening and in some cases destroying alternative voices that refuse to do their bidding. Ottman said it is even worse than people realize, though. \"When you go to people's websites who host Google ads, Google is actually spying on you through those websites,\" Ottman explained after Carlson argued that the duopoly practically \"owns\" news sites by controlling the whole ad market. \"So by putting Google ads on your website, you're actually becoming an agent of Google. That's why we need transparent, more freedom-based ad platforms to emerge which don't spy on people.\" And that is what his company, Minds, is working to provide.</p><p>Truth Cannot Be Silenced</p><p>No matter how vigorously Big Tech and Big Government work to censor the truth, it cannot be totally suppressed. But that does not mean the establishment will not use dirty tricks in its efforts to try. Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and numerous other prominent voices even suggested that there may be an imminent false-flag attack against the media to be blamed on Trump, Infowars, and others. And indeed, with top United Nations officials suggesting that Trump could be prosecuted for \"incitement\" against the media if and when something bad happens, it is hardly far-fetched to suggest that the globalist establishment could be planning something. An incredible series of blatant lies against Jones and Trump pushed by the establishment, coinciding with the unprecedented and escalating purge of dissenting voices online, certainly suggests something fishy is going on.</p><p>But even without a false-flag attack, the threat of full-blown Internet censorship at the national and even the global level is very real. With Obama having surrendered control over Internet infrastructure to globalist \"stakeholders\" unbound by the First Amendment, and with the UN and many of its more oppressive member regimes actively campaigning for censorship worldwide, Internet freedom has never been in more grave danger. Key components of the Internet's architecture were transferred to \"international stakeholders,\" making it potentially feasible to literally wipe somebody off the Internet completely - not just off social media. And the UN installed an actual Chinese Communist (who claims censorship is in the eye of the beholder) at the top of the UN International Telecommunications Union, the agency currently being groomed by the establishment for the role of world Internet regulator and censor. If the Orwellian trends are not halted, it could be just a matter of time before the World Wide Web faces fullblown_censorship by a rogue alliance of _ governments, dictators, international institutions, and their Big Business cronies.</p><p>But ultimately, even if the Internet is completely undermined as an effective means of educating and activating resistance to the establishment and its agenda, the fight for truth and against tyranny must go on. The John Birch Society has been leading the effort to save diminishing freedoms since the late 1950s - generations before the Internet was even born. Tools for accomplishing that included and still include printed publications, videos and DVDs, grassroots educational campaigns, public speeches to educate local communities and opinion molders, and much more. And despite the emergence of the Internet, these tools are still far from obsolete. If, somehow, the establishment manages to shut down the World Wide Web as a useful tool to disseminate the truth, The John Birch Society will continue to get the information out. And you can help. Get involved, or get more involved, today! *</p><p>For now, Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube) dominate the online advertising market, creating a sort of Internet ad duopoly that controls an estimated 75 percent of the digital advertising market.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2113740415</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDX-0381-JBHT-D22C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4278\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Sep 17, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Today, above politics and laws, there are web giants. </p><p>Not surprisingly, after the angry outburst of Donald Trump against Silicon Valley - during the electoral campaign and immediately after receiving his assignment- even the president had to calm down and accept the gentlemen's agreement. Google, Amazon &amp; Co. can freely do their own interests and, for example, keep not paying taxes they owe, as long as they support American foreign policy, when it decides to boycott, for example, China or Iran.Counting on this unwritten deal, Mark Zuckerberg announced that he will mint coins, without any reaction from the American and European central banks or from any international economic organization. Trump preferred to turn around and quarrel with Mario Draghi, while the European Commission is just interested in the Italian public debt as if the new currency matter does not concern the EU.Actually, it is a revolution. The Bitcoin (called Libra) becomes an adult, with the same algorithm as the cryptocurrency engine, but it will not be as unstable as now, due to its lack of transparency. The heroes of the digital revolution will protect it. For example, the 2.35 billion users of the Zuckerberg products will have less and less euros, dollars or local currency in their portfolio, because they will buy products on the web with Libra (on keyboards and on phones there will be a specific button to pay), and at any time they can change in the two currencies (virtual and paper).Big tech groups think that they have a whole new land to conquer, with a pile of cash to earn in the middle. The Zuckerberg Empire has alone more customers than Visa and Mastercard together, and therefore it could make money on commissions and other services by taking over not only credit cards (which participate in the business) but also banks, forcing radical changes in monetary structures. And here is where we are going to meet the problems of security, public control, privacy, and financial stability.\u00a9 Riproduzione riservataTraduzione di Carlo Ghirri</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OGGI-2520880</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OGGI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCW-C3D1-JBYW-K0GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">277196</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"384\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ItaliaOggi Editori S.p.A.

The public service broadcaster has faced strong competition from companies Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Netflix and has warned of their growing threat to British content in recent months.</p><p>Internal headwinds at the BBC have added to the pressure. In its annual plan published March 28, the BBC revealed that funding for its U.K. services had fallen 18% in real terms since 2010 as a result of British public service cuts, and that it was losing younger viewers to platforms such as Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube.</p><p>This year, the European Parliament, Council and Commission agreed on preliminary proposals aimed at reforming the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which lays out a common framework for all traditional broadcast and on-demand services within the EU's member states.</p><p>Under the new rules, which are designed to accommodate video's growing share of consumer internet traffic from 64% in 2014 to 80% by 2019, on-demand catalogs will be required to house at least a 30% share of European content.</p><p>Europe: Sept. 17 A delegation from the European Parliament's Education and Culture Committee will meet with representatives from companies including Google LLC, Facebook Inc., Netflix and Apple in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where they will discuss creative content regulation, fake news and disinformation, digital skills and the impact of technology on young people and education. Members of civil society and academia, including representatives from the University of California, Berkeley and University of Stanford, are also expected to meet the delegation during the trip, which takes place from Sept. 17-20. Sept. 20 The European Regulators Group for Postal Services will host a forum alongside the European Commission in Brussels. The event's goal is to debate the future of the postal regulatory framework with members of the postal, digital and e-commerce communities. United Kingdom: Sept. 18 BBC director general Tony Hall will call for more regulation of video streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon at the Royal Television Society's London conference. Other speakers at the event include Viacom Inc. President &amp; CEO Bob Bakish, Amazon Studios' Director of European Originals Georgia Brown, ITV PLC CEO Carolyn McCall and Ofcom CEO Sharon White.

According to the Senate executive calendar, the vote will occur no later than 5:30 p.m. ET \"with no intervening action or debate.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The vote comes as a number of Democrats in the Senate continue to raise concerns about the Republican FCC chairman and his efforts to roll back media regulations, particularly in the broadcast space. On Sept. 29, two dozen Democratic senators sent Pai a letter pointing to reports that the FCC intends to eliminate or weaken its remaining media ownership rules, which generally limit consolidation between newspapers, TV and radio stations operating in the same market. Earlier this year, Senate Commerce Committee Ranking Member <person><nameText>Bill Nelson, </nameText></person>D-Fla., expressed frustration about Pai's efforts to overturn the Open Internet Order of 2015, which reclassified broadband as a Title II service under the Communications, Act, making it subject to more stringent regulatory authority. Nelson warned at the time that he would judge Pai's success at the agency on his \"ability to put the public interest ahead of powerful special interests.\"</p><p>But Pai also has a wealth of supporters. Tom Struble, technology policy manager at the free market think tank R Street, described Pai in a Sept. 29 blog post as \"arguably the most well-qualified chairman the FCC has had in recent years,\" adding that any arguments to the contrary \"amount to a smokescreen for underlying disagreements with the market-oriented policy decisions Pai and his fellow commissioners have been pursuing at the FCC.\"</p><p>More importantly, Pai has the support of Congressional Republicans, making his confirmation on Oct. 2 all but guaranteed.</p><p>In Congress:</p><p>With key members of the House, Senate and the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>having come together to deliver their outline for tax reform last week, committees from both chambers of Congress are working to understand the potential impacts on the plan. During the week of Oct. 2, at least two hearings will be held to consider how the proposed tax cuts will specifically impact small businesses and startups. The Joint Economic Committee, a bicameral advisory committee, will hold a hearing on Oct. 3 at 10 a.m. ET entitled \"The Startup Slump: Can Tax Reform Help Revive Entrepreneurship?\" Members will discuss whether tax reform could boost the declining rate of startups, the businesses that drive nearly all net new job creation. Meanwhile, the House Committee on Small Business will hold a hearing titled, \"Small Business Tax Reform: Modernizing the Code for the Nation's Job Creators\" at 11:00 a.m. ET on Oct. 4.</p><p>Karen Kerrigan, president and CEO of the Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Council, said the tax reform proposal put forward thus far would lower the tax rates for small businesses and encourage investment and capital formation. \"These are the necessary pieces for producing a healthy ecosystem that will enable American entrepreneurs and small businesses to succeed,\" Kerrigan said.</p><p>The council, a research and advocacy group focused on small businesses, cited Census Bureau data showing new startups numbered 414,000 in 2015, which is well below the pre-Great Recession average of 524,000 annually. \"Our outdated tax system is a massive weight on the American economy and its entrepreneurs,\" Kerrigan said.</p><p>Under the tax reform outline unveiled on Sept. 27, the corporate tax rate would drop to 20%, down from the current statutory rate of 35%, while the maximum tax rate for small businesses would be capped at 25%.</p><p>Congressional hearings: Oct. 3 The Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. ET to consider international tax reform. Oct. 3 The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. ET to consider the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Oct. 3 The Joint Economic Committee will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. ET to examine tax reform and entrepreneurship. Oct. 4 The Senate Committee on Aging will hold a hearing at 9:30 a.m. ET to examine efforts to combat robocalls. Oct. 4 The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a business meeting at 10 a.m. ET to consider a number of bills, including one that would require the FCC to study the feasibility of designating a simple, easy-to-remember dialing code to be used for a national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system. Oct. 4 The House Committee on Small Business will hold a hearing at 11 a.m. ET looking at how tax reform stands to impact small businesses. The Senate Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law will hold a hearing at 2:30 p.m. ET to examine the Equifax data breach, focusing on continuing to monitor data-broker cybersecurity. FCC events Oct. 3 The 2019 World Radiocommunication Conference Advisory Committee's working group for regulatory issues is set to meet by phone at 10 a.m. ET.

The bill would slash the corporate tax rate to 20% from the existing 35% rate starting in 2019, and it would implement a repatriation rate of 10% for overseas cash and cash equivalents, as well as a 5% rate for noncash. But before any vote can occur, those inside and outside the Senate note much debate and even some changes to the proposal will be necessary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tax reform might have a bigger impact on some media and tech companies than others.</p><p>\"We have members who are expressing what are legitimate concerns, who have ideas about how to make the bill stronger and better. And we're certainly open to those,\" Sen. <person><nameText>John Thune, </nameText></person>R-S.D., said during a Nov. 26 interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Thune, who heads the Senate Commerce Committee and is chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, said the Senate will have an \"open process\" for amendments. \"Those amendments can get debated and voted upon. So   plenty of opportunities to change the bill in the direction that some of our senators want to see.\" Getting most of the 52 Senate Republicans on board with the bill will be essential if it is to pass without Democrat support. Senate Republicans hope to take advantage of special Senate budget rules that would enable them to pass certain tax measures with just 51 votes, rather than the 60 needed for most other legislation.</p><p>In order to drum up support for the bill, which calls for, Trump will address Republican senators at their weekly policy lunch on Nov. 28. Trump is also set to meet Nov. 28 with House Speaker <person><nameText>Paul Ryan, R-Wis.; </nameText></person>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Thune said Nov. 27 that despite the debate and the concerns around the bill, including its potential impact on the deficit, he expects tax reform to ultimately pass and become law.</p><p>The FCC:</p><p>While Congress creeps forward on tax reform, the Federal Communications Commission is moving forward on overhauling its net neutrality regulations. Just ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, Commission Chairman Ajit Pai released his plans for overturning the 2015 Open Internet Order, which classified broadband as a Title II service under the Communications Act. The classification made broadband subject to more stringent regulatory authority, enabling the FCC to enforce its net neutrality rules against blocking, throttling and paid prioritization. Now, Pai is looking to eliminate those rules and replace them with a transparency requirement, where broadband service providers will be required to inform customers if and when any blocking, throttling or prioritization is likely to occur.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the Dec. 14 vote on the proposal, both Democrats and Republicans on the commission will be looking to get their message out. Pai, a Republican, for instance, wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, arguing that the Title II classification imposed \"burdensome\" regulations on the broadband industry, discouraging investment. By overturning that classification, he said the FCC would allow broadband service providers to spend their money on deployment rather than compliance reports. \"Instead of being flyspecked by lawyers and bureaucrats, the internet would once again thrive under engineers and entrepreneurs,\" he said. But Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, responded with her own op-ed in the Los Angeles Times, saying that Pai's proposal is \"a lousy idea\" in that it would allow broadband providers to \"carve internet access into fast and slow lanes, favoring the traffic of online platforms that have made special payments and consigning all others to a bumpy road.\" She encouraged internet users to \"make a ruckus,\" arguing Pai's proposed order \"deserves a heated response from the millions of Americans who work and create online every day.\"</p><p>One early event aimed at informing consumers and legislators about the issue is a briefing hosted by the public interest group Public Knowledge at the Capitol Visitors Center on Nov. 29. The group, which has been a vocal proponent of the current net neutrality rules, said the aim of the briefing is to provide \"a legal and policy analysis\" of Pai's proposal.</p><p>Congressional hearings: Nov. 29 The U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee will examine the economic outlook with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen during a hearing at 10 a.m. ET.

There's no hard evidence that the planes have anything wrong with them, but similarities between the two crashes caused widespread concern among aviation officials (and passengers) around the world. <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>has promised a software fix and new training program for pilots by April, but it may take a lot longer to repair the damage to its reputation and its bottom line, considering the 737 Max was its best-selling jet ever.</p><p>  Losing Face</p><p>  Humans were forced to have actual conversations when <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Instagram and WhatsApp went dark for few hours on Wednesday. (The platforms, all owned by <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>were apparently suffering from a server issue.) But the company may not bounce back quite so fast when federal prosecutors start examining its business deals. Officials are  conducting a criminal investigation into partnerships that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>struck with other big tech companies, namely, agreements that involved handing over its users' personal information without their consent. Other signs of turmoil: Two of <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>top executives resigned on Thursday without giving explicit reasons.</p><p>  A Blow to the Gun Industry</p><p>  Firearm makers took a hit on Thursday when a Connecticut court ruled that the families of victims in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School could proceed with suing Remington, which made the AR-15 rifle used in the massacre. The decision conflicts with Congress's previous policy of shielding gun manufacturers whose weapons are used in a crime, and creates a potential opening to hold those companies liable. At the center of the lawsuit is Remington's promotional messaging, which the families argue shows an effort to appeal to troubled young men.

There\u2019s no hard evidence that the planes have anything wrong with them, but similarities between the two crashes caused widespread concern among aviation officials (and passengers) around the world. Boeinghas promised a software fix and new training program for pilots by April, but it may take a lot longer to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/business/boeing-737-manufacturer-cost.html\">repair the damage to its reputation</url> and its bottom line, considering the 737 Max was its best-selling jet ever.</p><p>Humans were forced to have actual conversations when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp went dark for few hours on Wednesday. (The platforms, all owned by Facebook, were apparently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/facebook-instagram-down.html\">suffering from a server issue</url>.) But the company may not bounce back quite so fast when federal prosecutors start examining its business deals. Officials are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/facebook-data-deals-investigation.html\">conducting a criminal investigation</url> into partnerships that Facebookstruck with other big tech companies, namely, agreements that involved handing over its users\u2019 personal information without their consent. Other signs of turmoil: Two of Facebook\u2019s top executives       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/technology/facebook-chris-cox.html\">resigned on Thursday</url> without giving explicit reasons. </p><p>Firearm makers took a hit on Thursday when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/nyregion/sandy-hook-supreme-court.html\">a Connecticut court ruled</url> that the families of victims in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School could proceed with suing Remington, which made the AR-15 rifle used in the massacre. The decision conflicts with Congress\u2019s previous policy of shielding gun manufacturers whose weapons are used in a crime, and creates a potential opening to hold those companies liable. At the center of the lawsuit is Remington\u2019s promotional messaging, which the families argue shows an effort to appeal to troubled young men. An outcome in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor could have far-reaching effects on how guns are marketed and sold. </p><p>What\u2019s Next? </p><p>We were so looking forward to March 29 as the last day of Brexit negotiations (and hearing people talk about them). But alas.

If you\u2019ve been too busy avoiding the heat to stay on top of the news, never fear. Catch up and prepare for the week ahead with the top stories in business and tech, and then get back to your lawn chair \u2014 the last weekend of July is best spent horizontal. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What\u2019s Up? (July 21-27)</p><p>A Record-Breaking Fine, or a Slap on the Wrist?</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission has ordered Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust-investigation.html\">to pay $5 billion</url> for mishandling users\u2019 data \u2014 the largest fine the F.T.C. has ever imposed. Sound familiar? The company also paid a record-breaking settlement to the Securities and Exchange Commission for a similar charge earlier this year. The latest deal requires Facebook to create a privacy committee and increase transparency and accountability of how it treats people\u2019s personal information. But       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/opinion/facebook-fine-5-billion.html\">critics say</url> the punishment is trifling to the tech giant, which posted rip-roaring quarterly growth numbers on Thursday. Enter Chris Hughes, one of Facebook\u2019s founders, who       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html\">believes the company has gotten too big</url> and is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/technology/chris-hughes-facebook-breakup.html\">working with the government</url> to break it up. </p><p>Taking Aim at Food Stamps</p><p>The Trump administration has proposed new restrictions on food stamps \u2014 namely, who\u2019s eligible for them and who isn\u2019t. More than 38 million low-income Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but 3.1 million of them would lose access under the new rule. Supporters of the measure say it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/pressrelease/usda-011319\">closes a \u201cloophole\u201d</url> that allows people to qualify for SNAP even when they \u201cclearly don\u2019t need it.\u201d They also claim that the change would save taxpayers $2.5 billion a year \u2014 a slight dent in the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/budget-spending-deal.html\">ever-ballooning federal deficit</url>. Opponents call the resolution \u201ccruel, ideological and inhumane,\u201d and say it will harm the country\u2019s working poor. </p><p>Deutsche Bank\u2019s Next Headache</p><p>The embattled German bank <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/business/deutsche-bank-earnings-loss.html\">hemorrhaged money and jobs</url> in a costly restructuring last quarter. Now, it\u2019s dealing with another public relations nightmare: Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and convicted sex offender who is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-charges.html\">facing new charges</url> of human trafficking and sexual abuse. Mr. Epstein was a Deutsche Bank client from 2013 to 2018 and used its wealth management services to move money outside the United States \u2014       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/business/jeffrey-epstein-deutsche-bank.html\">potentially to nefarious ends</url>. The financial institution is already under scrutiny for suspected money laundering and its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/business/deutsche-bank-donald-trump.html\">ties to President Trump</url>. How did things get so out of hand? As part of an aggressive, 20-year push to expand internationally, Deutsche Bank took on many high-risk clients that others avoided. Now, it\u2019s paying the price. </p><p>What\u2019s Next? (July 28-Aug. 3)</p><p>Tech Takes Center Stage</p><p>The top 20 Democratic presidential candidates will face off in their second round of debates on Tuesday and Wednesday. Expect more talk about how to better regulate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/russian-hacking-elections.html\">the role of Big Tech</url> in the next election. Or they could just cut to the chase and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/technology/tulsi-gabbard-sues-google.html\">sue Google for $50 million</url>, as Representative Tulsi Gabbard, the long-shot candidate from Hawaii, did last week. Ms. Gabbard claims that Google infringed on her free speech when it briefly suspended her campaign\u2019s advertising account after the first Democratic debate in June. (Google says the shutdown was caused by the account\u2019s \u201cunusually high activity\u201d \u2014 often a sign of fraud that its systems are designed to flag.) The lawsuit raises larger questions about the power of tech companies over candidates\u2019 online exposure. </p><p>Keep an Eye on Your Phone Bills</p><p>T-Mobile and Sprint, the country\u2019s third- and fourth-biggest wireless networks, just <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/business/media/sprint-tmobile-merger.html\">got a green light from the Justice Department</url> for a huge merger that\u2019s been years in the making. Their combined forces will create stiff competition for the top two phone companies, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon. But it\u2019s also being watched by antitrust hawks who argue that it monopolizes too much of the market. The Justice Department\u2019s blessing is a major victory for the merger, but now it must clear another hurdle: a lawsuit brought by several states that claim it would hit consumers with higher charges. </p><p>A Booster Shot</p><p>That interest rate cut that Mr. Trump has been demanding for ages? It\u2019s finally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/upshot/economy-fed-powell-rate-cuts-analysis.html\">expected to materialize</url> when the Federal Reserve meets this week. Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate decrease as a means to stimulate the economy and counteract trade uncertainties (see above re: China) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/business/european-central-bank-stimulus.html\">weakening global growth</url>. But some analysts argue that the rate cut is premature, given the health of the American economy, which still boasts record low unemployment. The latest       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/business/economy/us-gdp-growth.html\">report</url> shows a significant deceleration from the first quarter, but the economy still grew by a robust 2.1 percent \u2014 nothing to sneeze at. </p><p>What Else?</p><p>Lots of auto news last week. Four of the world\u2019s biggest car companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/climate/automakers-rejecting-trump-pollution-rule-strike-a-deal-with-california.html\">struck an agreement with California</url> to tighten emissions rules, rejecting Mr. Trump\u2019s latest attempts to roll back federal pollution standards set by the Obama administration. Nissan, not among the deal makers, announced it was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/business/nissan-job-cuts-profit.html\">laying off 12,500 workers</url> and doing damage control on its plummeting profits. Speaking of transportation woes: The grounding of Boeing\u2019s troubled fleet of 737 Max jets is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/business/southwest-airlines-newark.html\">taking a major toll on airline profits</url> \u2014 and no one knows when they\u2019ll be back in the air.</p><p>Facebook scams are hitting vulnerable women.

I'm on vacation next week, escaping the subtropical zone of Brooklyn for the sanity-restoring woods of Vermont, so Gillian Friedman will be filling in. Until then, here's what you need to know in business and tech for the week ahead.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  What's Up? (July 26-Aug. 1)</p><p>  A Long Fall</p><p>  Appalling new data shows just how badly the pandemic has devastated the United States economy: Gross domestic product shrank 9.5 percent, or 32.9 percent at an adjusted annual rate, in the second quarter of this year, according to a report from the Commerce Department. It's the most severe collapse in the 70-plus years that G.D.P. statistics have been compiled, and wiped away nearly five years of economic growth. If the virus were now under control, the dive could prove to be temporary. But with cases surging in many states, a quick comeback is looking less and less likely.</p><p>  No Mask, No Service</p><p>  The science is clear that masks help slow the spread of the coronavirus and allow people to shop and go out in public more safely. That's why many big businesses, most recently McDonald's, are requiring customers to wear them. But there's a wrinkle: Enforcement is tricky. Stores like Walmart have appointed ''health ambassadors'' to remind customers to put on masks before entering, but if someone refuses, what is the employee going to do? Confront the person and get breathed on? No thanks. Many businesses are struggling to contend with this loophole, which affects the safety of other customers as well as employees.</p><p>  On the Spot</p><p>  The chief executives of the tech industry's ''Big Four'' -- Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google -- faced a blistering round of questions (via video, awkwardly) from a congressional antitrust panel on Wednesday. The hearing was a culmination of a yearlong investigation into monopolies in the digital market, and those in the hot seat -- Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai -- struggled to defend claims that their companies had broken antitrust laws by exploiting their size to consolidate power and thwart rivals. Lawmakers vowed to tighten regulations, but how they'll do that remains to be seen. And the companies continue to rake in money as the pandemic makes consumers more reliant on digital services. Apple, Amazon and Facebook all reported blockbuster revenue this past week, and Google reported better earnings than expected.</p><p>  What's Next? (Aug. 2-8)</p><p>  Not So Fast</p><p>Congress may talk a big game about reining in big tech, but European Union leaders are actually doing it. In the past, European officials have been notoriously aggressive about trying to hit American tech companies where it hurts -- with higher taxes and business restrictions -- with varying success. Now, they are pursuing a handful of new laws that would narrow the scope of what digital businesses can do and sell. One would make it illegal for Amazon and Apple to steer customers toward their own products instead of those made by rivals. Another would establish stricter rules against hate speech on social networks. If any of these proposed laws come to fruition, they could push the platforms to change their behaviors worldwide.</p><p>  Deadlocked</p><p>  Millions of workers (roughly one in five) are still out of work in the United States, and they're about to get desperate. Until the end of July, they were receiving supplementary unemployment benefits (an extra $600 a week) from the federal government as part of the CARES Act that was passed in March. But that provision expired on Friday, and efforts to extend or replace parts of it stalled in Washington this past week when President Trump put the kibosh on negotiations for a broad relief package. (His chief of staff summed things up: ''We're nowhere near a deal.'') Lawmakers are now scrambling to find a quick Band-Aid, like another round of direct payments to Americans, many of whom are facing the threat of eviction.</p><p>  Where Are the Jobs?</p><p>  The July employment report comes out this Friday, and analysts are split on where things stand. Most economists expect the numbers to show another increase in payrolls for the third consecutive month (good!), but say that it will be modest -- after all, several big states have paused and even reversed their reopenings as the number of virus cases increases (bad). Others think payrolls may have even declined. One thing we do know for sure: The number of new jobless claims is on the rise again for the second week in a row, which doesn't paint a promising picture.</p><p>  What Else?</p><p>  Herman Cain, the businessman, pizza chain executive and one-time presidential hopeful, died after being hospitalized with the coronavirus. Neiman Marcus, the upscale department store that filed for bankruptcy in May, plans to close a number of its stores this fall, including its glittery new flagship at Hudson Yards in Manhattan. And the Federal Reserve pledged to keep interest rates near zero while the economy continues to flail.</p><p>  Was this newsletter forwarded to you?

Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's your quick rundown of the week's biggest stories in business and tech, so you can spend more of your weekend hours enjoying the sun on the longest days of the year. (Or, you know, sit inside and watch season 2 of ''Dark'' on Netflix. You do you.) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ______</p><p>  What's Up? (June 16-22)</p><p>  Social Currency</p><p>  Maybe you don't trust Facebook with your personal information. But what about your money? On Tuesday, the tech giant announced an ambitious vision for its new digital currency, Libra, which it has been secretly working on for over a year and plans to roll out in early 2020. Unlike Bitcoin, Libra will be backed by actual currency (the dollar, the euro and so on), ideally making it more stable. Facebook's larger goal: to create a global financial system that enables people to send and receive funds online without dealing with banks at all -- effectively cutting out (or replacing) the middleman. But the plan already faces an uphill battle with government officials, who have no idea how they'll regulate it.</p><p>  Same Rates, New Story</p><p>  The stock market hit a record high on Thursday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said he might be open to lowering interest rates -- but not just yet. The Fed chose last week  to keep rates where they are for now. Their decision defied the wishes of President Trump, who has been pushing for decreased rates to juice the slowing economy, weaken the dollar and help with his trade wars. Still, Mr. Powell indicated that rate cuts might be on the horizon if ''increased uncertainties'' continue to weigh on American businesses and consumers. Many investors are now predicting that cuts could happen as soon as this summer.</p><p>  The Slack Surprise</p><p>  Silicon Valley darlings like Uber, Lyft and Pinterest got a ton of hype when they went public earlier this year. So how did the tech start-up Slack -- a workplace messaging platform so widespread that it has become a verb (''I'll Slack you'') -- manage to sneak onto the trading floor on Thursday with little to no anticipatory fuss? Also unlike Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices have dropped since their initial public offerings, Slack's valuation proceeded to blow past estimates. The difference may be that Slack took an unusual route called a direct listing, in which a company does not issue new shares or raise capital; its stock simply begins trading. In the process, Slack may have inadvertently modeled a more successful I.P.O. than its larger, splashier counterparts.</p><p>  ______</p><p>  What's Next? (June 23-29)</p><p>  Anyone's Race</p><p>  Ready to winnow down the giant pack of Democratic presidential candidates? That process will begin this week, when 20 potential nominees are split across two nights of primary debates in Miami. The candidates have outlined wide-ranging plans to improve health care, reduce income inequality and tackle climate change. Big Tech is another potential talking point. Or more specifically, how to better regulate it to protect users' privacy and shield platforms from illegal activity (like, say, Russian hackers). Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed a sweeping plan that would break up companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. As for everyone else ... we'll find out.</p><p>  They Meet Again</p><p>  When the Group of 20 summit begins this week in Japan, Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will come face to face for the first time since their delegates' trade talks fell apart in May. Not awkward at all! If they can rekindle negotiations in sideline meetings during the conference, it would be a major forward step for a global economy that is becoming increasingly fractured. The World Trade Organization says that G-20 economies are imposing new trade barriers at a rate well above the historical average, with no sign of letting up, unless Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi can shift the trend.</p><p>  A Close Call</p><p>  What's scarier than a trade war? An actual war with a country that controls a big chunk of the world's oil supply. Tensions between the United States and Iran got so heated last week that Mr. Trump approved military strikes on a handful of Iranian targets -- and then pulled back abruptly on Thursday night. Days earlier, Iran announced that it would break the conditions of its 2015 nuclear deal on June 27 unless other countries in the pact -- like Germany, France and Britain -- will help defend it against the crippling oil sanctions that Mr. Trump reimposed in 2017. To hammer home the point, Iran then shot down an American surveillance drone. Whose side will the world powers take? One thing's for sure: No one wants more destabilization in the petroleum market.</p><p>  ______</p><p>  What Else?</p><p>  The list of humans worth over $100 billion has grown to three from two. Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has officially joined Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Microsoft's Bill Gates in the world's 12-figure-fortune club. Speaking of big money, Google will invest $1 billion to ease the housing crisis it helped create in the San Francisco Bay Area. The funds will go toward at least 15,000 new, more ''affordable'' homes for those getting priced out of the neighborhood. In other news, the director and producer Janet Mock became the first known transgender woman to get a major Hollywood deal by signing a three-year, multimillion-dollar agreement with Netflix.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>CHARTS: SO FAR THIS YEAR</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p> DRAWINGS (DRAWINGS BY GIACOMO BAGNARA)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-725196190623</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDB-PDS1-JBG3-6383-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"892\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/business/the-week-in-business-stocks-facebook-trade.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/business/the-week-in-business-stocks-facebook-trade.html</url><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 23, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here\u2019s your quick rundown of the week\u2019s biggest stories in business and tech, so you can spend more of your weekend hours enjoying the sun on the longest days of the year. (Or, you know, sit inside and watch season 2 of \u201cDark\u201d on Netflix. You do you.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What\u2019s Up? (June 16-22)</p><p>Maybe you don\u2019t trust Facebook with your personal information. But what about your money? On Tuesday, the tech giant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/technology/facebook-cryptocurrency-libra.html\">announced an ambitious vision</url> for its new digital currency, Libra, which it has been secretly working on for over a year and plans to roll out in early 2020. Unlike Bitcoin, Libra will be backed by actual currency (the dollar, the euro and so on), ideally making it more stable. Facebook\u2019s larger goal: to create a global financial system that enables people to send and receive funds online without dealing with banks at all \u2014 effectively cutting out (or replacing) the middleman. But the plan already faces       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/06/18/us/ap-us-facebook-digital-currency-obstacles.html\">an uphill battle</url> with government officials, who have no idea how they\u2019ll regulate it. </p><p>The stock market <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/business/stock-market-record.html\">hit a record high on Thursday</url> after the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said he might be open to lowering interest rates \u2014 but not just yet. The Fed chose last week       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/upshot/fed-threads-needle-rate-cuts.html\">to keep rates where they are</url> for now. Their decision defied the wishes of President Trump, who has been pushing for decreased rates to juice the slowing economy, weaken the dollar and help with his trade wars. Still, Mr. Powell indicated that rate cuts might be on the horizon if \u201cincreased uncertainties\u201d continue to weigh on American businesses and consumers. Many investors are now predicting that cuts could happen as soon as this summer. </p><p>Silicon Valley darlings like Uber, Lyft and Pinterest got a ton of hype when they went public earlier this year. So how did the tech start-up Slack \u2014 a workplace messaging platform so widespread that it has become a verb (\u201cI\u2019ll Slack you\u201d) \u2014 manage to sneak onto the trading floor on Thursday with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/technology/slack-stock-ipo-price-trading.html\">little to no anticipatory fuss</url>? Also unlike Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices have dropped since their initial public offerings, Slack\u2019s valuation proceeded to blow past estimates. The difference may be that Slack took an unusual route called a direct listing, in which a company does not issue new shares or raise capital; its stock simply begins trading. In the process, Slack may have inadvertently modeled a more successful I.P.O. than its larger, splashier counterparts. </p><p>What\u2019s Next? (June 23-29)</p><p>Ready to winnow down the giant pack of Democratic presidential candidates? That process will begin this week, when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/06/20/us/20reuters-usa-election-debate-explainer.html\">20 potential nominees</url> are split across two nights of primary debates in Miami. The candidates have outlined wide-ranging plans to improve health care, reduce income inequality and tackle climate change. Big Tech is another potential talking point. Or more specifically, how to better regulate it to protect users\u2019 privacy and shield platforms from illegal activity (like, say, Russian hackers). Senator Elizabeth Warren has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">proposed a sweeping plan</url> that would break up companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. As for everyone else \u2026 we\u2019ll find out. </p><p>When the Group of 20 summit begins this week in Japan, Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/trump-china-meeting-trade.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FGroup%20of%2020&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=4&amp;pgtype=collection\">will come face to face</url> for the first time since their delegates\u2019 trade talks fell apart in May. Not awkward at all! If they can rekindle negotiations in sideline meetings during the conference, it would be a major forward step for a global economy that is becoming increasingly fractured. The World Trade Organization says that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/06/20/business/20reuters-g20-summit-trade.html\">G-20 economies are imposing new trade barriers</url> at a rate well above the historical average, with no sign of letting up, unless Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi can shift the trend. </p><p>What\u2019s scarier than a trade war? An actual war with a country that controls a big chunk of the world\u2019s oil supply. Tensions between the United States and Iran got so heated last week that Mr. Trump approved military strikes on a handful of Iranian targets \u2014 and then <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/world/middleeast/iran-us-drone.html\">pulled back abruptly</url> on Thursday night. Days earlier, Iran announced that it would break the conditions of its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html\">2015 nuclear deal</url> on June 27 unless other countries in the pact \u2014 like Germany, France and Britain \u2014 will help defend it against the crippling oil sanctions that Mr. Trump reimposed in 2017. To hammer home the point, Iran then       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/drone-shot-down-iran-us.html\">shot down</url> an American surveillance drone. Whose side will the world powers take? One thing\u2019s for sure: No one wants more destabilization in the petroleum market.</p><p>What Else?</p><p>The list of humans worth over $100 billion has grown to three from two. Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-18/arnault-joins-bezos-gates-in-most-exclusive-billionaires-club\">officially joined</url> Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates in the world\u2019s 12-figure-fortune club. Speaking of big money,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/technology/google-1-billion-housing-crisis.html\">Google will invest $1 billion</url> to ease the housing crisis it helped create in the San Francisco Bay Area. The funds will go toward at least 15,000 new, more \u201caffordable\u201d homes for those getting priced out of the neighborhood. In other news, the director and producer Janet Mock became the first known transgender woman to get a major Hollywood deal by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/history-making-moves-janet-mock-inks-multi-million/story?id=63820428\">signing a three-year, multimillion-dollar agreement</url> with
