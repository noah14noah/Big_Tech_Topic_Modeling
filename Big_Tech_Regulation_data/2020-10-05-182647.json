Trade association News Media Europe supported a 'strengthened secondary liability framework for intermediaries that acknowledges differences between content hosts and content producer.'</p><p>Moreover, NME also supported the notion of improving the eCommerce liability framework, stating that \"a certain degree of monitoring obligation is desirable and necessary to make platforms more accountable towards business partners, public authorities and most importantly the safety of users.\"</p><p>Industry organisation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecommerce-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ECOM-DSA-Position-Paper-08-09-2020-1.pdf\">ECommerce Europe</url>\u00a0is concerned about the increased flow of unsafe products emanating from non-EU countries, coming into the EU.</p><p>\"While EU-based players have to comply with European and national rules and standards, not all non-EU operators that offer or facilitate the sales of goods to European consumers do or have to,\" the group said.</p><p>The European Commission's Vice-President for Digital, Margarethe Vestager, has previously said that counterfeit and illegal sellers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/counterfeit-and-illegal-sellers-to-be-targeted-in-digital-services-act-vestager-says/\">are likely to be targeted</url> in the digital services act.</p><p>Staying in the e-Commerce world, workers' unions UNI Global and UNI Europe levelled a series of accusations at Amazon and welcomed the Commission's introduction of a new competition tool and ex-ante regulation as part of the Digital Services Act to \"correct market dysfunctions and benefit sellers, consumers and workers alike.\"</p><p>Elsewhere in Brussels, EURACTIV obtained a copy of recent amendments made by rapporteur Alex Agius Saliba to the Internal Market Committee's report on the digital services act.</p><p>While no substantive changes were made, Saliba <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/IMCO-DSA-CAs-on-resolution-A-to-H-8-9-2020.pdf\">introduced</url> the importance of complying with the principle of data minimisation as outlined in the EU's general data protection regulation.</p><p>\"Intermediaries of digital services should enable to the maximum extent possible the anonymous use of their services,\" one such amendment read.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1503612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-DHC1-JCF9-40M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1230\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is incumbent on operators now to act and put in place measures that protect their customers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If I am brutally honest, this is an area where the betting industry has not historically covered itself in glory. We can and should do more.</p><p>If anyone in the online sector has reservations about what I am saying here then I would only point to what has happened in the retail betting industry. Fixed-odds betting terminals have long been acknowledged as a social concern but not enough was done by operators over the years to mitigate their impact.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/06/23/watchdog-targets-online-gambling-firms-load-dice-against-players/\">The Government was forced to act, with proposals for regulation that are likely to have a significant impact on the bottom lines of retail bookmakers</url> . Because it is the right thing to do for our customers and because it will help to protect our long-term sustainability as an industry, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming is putting forward a four-point plan to the online gambling sector.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/06/23/watchdog-targets-online-gambling-firms-load-dice-against-players/\">FOBT numbers</url></p><p>First, we must use customer data to understand player behaviour, and monitor for signs of harm. Second, we have to promote safer gambling by improving the accessibility, awareness and understanding of self-help tools such as deposit limits and cool-offs.\u00a0</p><p>Third, we must interact with customers who show signs of harm, discuss their gambling behaviour with them, and present details of their behaviour clearly. Finally, we will have to increase our interventions with customers to stop them harming themselves in the most extreme cases.\u00a0</p><p>Over the EFL playoff final weekend, we also launched a specific initiative that we hope will ensure a healthier relationship between gambling and sport. This year, we wanted to use the event to remind fans that nothing should get in the way of this enjoyment. Not even their betting.\u00a0</p><p>That's why we ramped up our safer gambling marketing campaign so that throughout the weekend on TV, in the press, on the radio and at Wembley, fans could see messages reminding them to stay in control of what they spent with us. \u00a0</p><p>The matches over the weekend also saw, for the first time, our new safer gambling shirt sleeve logos. These logos will be visible on every player in every game across the EFL from the start of next season. Over the course of next season, we expect more than 18m people to attend fixtures and millions more following through the media to see this message.\u00a0</p><p>We also want to use our sponsorship of the EFL to help those in the game. Research shows that professional sportsmen are three times more likely to be problem gamblers, and are often the last to ask for help. That's why we've launched a new \u00a31m education programme in partnership with the EFL and its clubs, designed to ensure that players and staff understand the risks associated with gambling across all sports, the rules around betting integrity, and know how to look out for signs of potential gambling-related harm in their teammates.\u00a0</p><p>I would also stress to government that our ability to intervene with problem gamblers depends on our capacity to invest in high-skilled staff and the technology of the future. This will be hampered by the Government's current proposals to raise remote gaming duty to compensate for the loss of revenue from fixed-odds betting terminals.\u00a0</p><p>There are more equitable solutions out there - such as taxing other big tech companies who don't pay their fair share of tax - and we would urge the Treasury to look at these instead.

Mounds of personal data are flowing to political consultants attempting to influence your vote, government agencies trying to find lawbreakers and scammers trying to trick you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But the way most people feel the results day to day is through marketing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Christopher Day knows better than most how intrusive technology can be.</p><p> He's the founder of an Indianapolis tech company, DemandJump, that uses artificial intelligence to help companies identify customers and send them the right messages to procure sales.</p><p> But Day has also been a victim of what he calls annoying and even creepy cyber-marketing \u2014 strategies that are different from those employed by DemandJump.</p><p> Late last year, Day was thinking about buying a Peloton, a popular indoor exercise bike. He had never searched for nor discussed Peloton online or in emails. He had never contacted the manufacturer or a retailer about the product.</p><p> But with his smartphone in his pocket, Day discussed the bike with friends at a holiday party. And he believes his phone \u2014 either through the operating system or an app he installed \u2014 was listening.</p><p> Suddenly, he began receiving digital ads for Peloton across his devices.</p><p> \"That feels too invasive,\" Day said. \"That made me not want to buy the product. And I didn't.\"</p><p> But despite the marketing fail with Day, many advertisers are relying on these and other cyber tactics to get their products in front of customers \u2014 repeatedly.</p><p> Everything you do with your electronic devices is monitored, tracked, reported and stored. And all that information is saved indefinitely, ready to be rolled out at a moment's notice to help a company make a sale.</p><p> While consumers can take some steps to stem the peeping, it's tough to stop the data gathering completely without going off the grid \u2014 a difficult move given that the tools that make life convenient today are the very ones marketers exploit.</p><p> Cookie monster</p><p> Companies build profiles about customers and track them in a number of ways. But the most important ingredient might be cookies\u2014and not the edible kind.</p><p> Cookies are bits of programming that operate in the background of a website, app or device.</p><p> The name is derived from the term \"magic cookie,\" which is what programmers in the late 1970s called a packet of data a program picks up from a user's computer and sends elsewhere for identification purposes. Cookies grab what's called an IP address, an identifying number assigned to every device on an internet-connected network. But cookies don't necessarily know the user or owner of that device (although, as you'll see, those dots aren't difficult to connect).</p><p> Cookies have some important, practical functions. For example, they let web servers know whether someone is logged into a site, and which account they are logged in with. IBJ uses cookies, for example, to help determine whether a reader on its website is a subscriber.</p><p> But programmers have discovered even more valuable marketing uses for cookies. Ever wonder how you can leave an online store \u2014 or close your browser or turn off your computer entirely \u2014 and come back a few minutes, hours or even days later to find the contents in your shopping cart still there? Or how an airline knows about a reservation you started but didn't complete?</p><p> That's information the web browser deposited on your computer with a cookie. When you go back to the site, the computer reads the cookie and distills the information from your previous visits.</p><p> And that's just the first crumb of what cookies can track. They can tell a site what pages you looked at and for how long, what items you clicked on and even where you put your cursor. Some can even track \u2014 through your webcam \u2014 where you trained your eyes.</p><p> But not every cookie is created \u2014 or accessed \u2014 equally.</p><p> Cookies deposited on your computer by a website operator are called first-party cookies. Generally, first-party cookies can be read \u2014 in their entirety \u2014 only by the website that deposited them.</p><p> Website developers say those kinds of cookies help them customize content to suit you. Think ESPN.com, which uses cookies to track your browsing, reading and viewing, then recommends other stories.</p><p> Third-party cookies are another story entirely. They are deposited by ads, online quizzes, games and other content users download or visit. So if you click on, say, a Nike ad and then go to the Nike website, the site will retrieve that cookie to get a better idea of who you are and how you like to shop.</p><p> Tracking your every move</p><p> But why, after you search for a product or click on an ad, do ads for those and related products begin popping up \u2014 no matter where you surf?</p><p> Enter data brokers and trackers \u2014 a vast and growing network of companies that are not only depositing cookies but also selling that information to a wide range of retailers, service providers and websites. A national or global company might subscribe to a dozen or more data brokers and others services to track current and potential customers.</p><p> Say you go to a car dealer's website and then surf to a news site. If those two sites subscribe to the same ad network \u2014 or network of networks \u2014 then, voila, you'll see an ad for the very vehicle you were researching, even though the story you're reading has nothing to do with cars.</p><p> \"It's like you once stopped in a car dealership, but now you' re at the grocery store and someone is chasing you around the grocery store yelling at you to see if you want to buy a car,\" said DemandJump's Day. \"In real life, internet marketing methods might be considered harassment.\"</p><p>DemandJump doesn't rely on cookies, Day said. It uses math and artificial intelligence to make sure companies have access to consumers in the \"buying mode\" of their product. It's a complicated business that relies on programing to recognize the precise wording of search queries.</p><p> But thousands of companies use cookies, and so, as you travel from website to website, you are taking on cookies like a well-traveled ship takes on barnacles.</p><p> \"Your IP address is being collected by every single network you pass through, and that includes services like Netflix,\" said Warren Sifre, principal consultant for Moser Consulting, an Indianapolis-based information technology company that specializes in business intelligence and advanced analytics.</p><p> Free software and apps are huge data-gathering tools.</p><p> \"There is a reason why things are free,\" Sifre said. \"It wouldn't make much business sense to develop an application that had zero return on investment, whether it be directly or indirectly.\"</p><p> The combination of millions of cookies and huge data brokerages means retailers and other companies can divine within a second of your landing on their website where else you've been on the internet and everything you've clicked on, read, viewed or listened to \u2014 sometimes for years, even a decade or more.</p><p> \"People don't appreciate the permanence of this data,\" said Brian McGinnis, a partner in the local law office of Barnes and Thornburg and a cybersecurity expert. \"There's a reason why some companies are building massive data centers. The internet doesn't forget.\"</p><p> Getting personal</p><p> Combine cookies with personal data \u2014 your name, birthdate, hometown and more \u2014 and the outcomes become very personal.</p><p> Among the ingredients is Facebook \u2014 and its forerunner, MySpace.</p><p> When the first major social network, MySpace, came along in 2003, it seemed like a great way for people to stay connected to family and friends. But marketers \u2014 and social media sites themselves\u2014quickly realized the value of the information it was gathering. Then came Facebook, with its worldwide reach, which took personalized marketing to a new level.</p><p> Social networks have induced people to voluntarily cough up the information marketers have long coveted: name, residence, age, occupation, nationality, dating status, hobbies, vacation destinations, you name it. And all that information can be easily attached to the IP address of your laptop, tablet or, increasingly, your smartphone.</p><p> And Facebook has made a tidy bundle of cash selling that data. Though the company won't disclose the amount, multiple tech sources estimate the world's biggest social media network makes $10 billion annually selling data.</p><p> Through your device's IP address, data brokers, trackers and ad networks can not only know all about you, but also where your device is at any given time\u2014almost down to the square foot.</p><p> But this treasure trove of data doesn't all come from Facebook.</p><p> There is another cadre of companies whose sole mission is to scrape every imaginable piece of your personal information \u2014 even some you might not imagine \u2014 from online public records and sell it to the highest bidder.</p><p> These trackers collect property records, court filings, driver's license and motor vehicle records, census data, birth certificates, marriage licenses, divorce records, state professional and recreational license records, voter registration information, bankruptcy records, and on and on.</p><p> They also collect or buy information from commercial sources, snatching up people's purchasing histories, including the dates, dollar amounts, payments used, loyalty cards and coupons used, as well as warranty registration information from retailers and catalog companies.</p><p> And, of course, they also exchange or purchase information from one another, then merge the data. Most data brokers have profiles on millions of people, each with thousands of characteristics.</p><p> \"Some would say those companies know you better than you know yourself,\" McGinnis said. \"And with predictive analytics becoming increasingly sophisticated, they're getting much better at predicting your next move.\"</p><p> The Federal Trade Commission took a hard look at the shadowy world of data brokers seven years ago and released a 110-page report in May 2014. But it stopped short of instituting any sweeping regulations\u2014or even requiring data brokers to reveal what they are collecting about whom and with whom they share it.</p><p> It is possible for consumers to opt out of some data collection on some sites, but the process is time-consuming, difficult and needs to be regularly repeated because data brokers keep collecting more. Some brokers pull data from other sites and update automatically. And some data brokers don't remove information even when asked.</p><p> People still struggle to understand the nature and scope of the data collected about them. In a recent Pew Research Center study, half of all respondents said they don't know why their data is being gathered and 9% said there's nothing they can do to control it.</p><p> \"Most have no idea who these companies are and how they got their data on them, and they would be very surprised to know the intimate details that these companies have collected on people,\" said Amul Kalia, an analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a global digital rights group based in San Francisco.</p><p> The big four</p><p> The biggest data gatherers in the game \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google\u2014are not in the shadows at all.</p><p> The reach of those four behemoths is dizzying. And to expand their reach, the companies have made a multitude of acquisitions.</p><p> Collectively, they own websites, operating systems, devices, cloud storage systems and more that gather truckloads of data about you every day.</p><p>Google has made more than one acquisition a month for the last decade. In 2014 alone, it purchased a staggering 34 companies. Its acquisitions include YouTube and DoubleClick, companies that expand its reach far beyond its ubiquitous search engine.</p><p>Google likely knows everything you've ever searched for on the internet, all the apps you use or have ever used, the YouTube videos you've watched dating back to 2008, many of the events you attended and when, every image you've ever searched for and saved, every location you've ever searched and clicked on, and every news article you've searched for and read. It also has a five-year history of the photos many people have taken with their cell phones.</p><p> And all that information is being constantly monitored, stored and backed up in massive data centers.</p><p> It's not clear how all the data is used \u2014 even among data collectors and buyers. Some in the tech sector say the companies collecting the data don't yet have a use for all the information, but are saving it in perpetuity assuming that technological advances such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics will someday give even the tiniest piece of information value.</p><p> The data Google has on most individuals can fill millions of virtual dump trucks. A data collection file on a single person can easily be 5.5 gigabytes, which is 3 million Word documents.</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, collects data on and stores your login location, time and the device used; data on where you are and where you've been; what apps you've installed (plus when you use them and what for); all the devices you've ever used to log in to your account; all the apps you've ever connected to your Facebook account; and every (audio and digital) message, file, emoji and sticker you've sent or been sent.</p><p>Facebook also collects and stores all the contacts in your phone, what it thinks you are interested in based on the things you have liked and \u2014 maybe most eerie \u2014 what you and your friends talk about.</p><p> The social network monitors and stores information on the games you play; your photos and videos, music, search and browsing history; radio listening habits; and your emails, call history and files you download.</p><p> The company also can access your webcam and microphone.</p><p>Facebook data on a single person who uses a computer and social media a moderate amount can exceed 600 megabytes, which is 400,000 Word documents.</p><p> Many marketing tech companies \u2014 a number of which are in Indianapolis \u2014 sit on the shoulders of the Facebooks of the world, said Mark Clerkin, vice president of data science for local venture studio High Alpha.</p><p> With the vast tech empires controlled by Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, chances are that, most of your waking hours, you're using a device, operating system or website owned or operated \u2014 in part or in whole \u2014 by one of them.</p><p> \"If you are using a computer or the web, it's difficult to get beyond their reach,\" McGinnis said.</p><p> Listening in</p><p>Apple's 2010 acquisition of Siri Inc. took data gathering to a new level, one that has been elevated by a proliferation of smart speakers and televisions that are always listening.</p><p> Introduced in 2011, Siri was touted as an efficient and fun way to search for information. Siri (which has been incorporated into iPhones, iPads and other Apple devices) is a keen listener \u2014 even when it's not being addressed. The same is true for Amazon Echo and Google Home.</p><p> \"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the makers of those devices say, and what those devices actually do,\" McGinnis said. \"The makers of the devices say they don't track the information.\"</p><p>DemandJump's Day isn't buying it. \"How else are they reaching out to you when you are not searching online for something?\" he said.</p><p> He's not alone in his skepticism.</p><p> \"I'm 100% convinced companies are listening to people through devices, including smart speakers and phones,\" said Chris Rodgers, a search engine optimization expert based in Denver.</p><p> \"It's becoming increasingly common that companies are taking audio and translating that into data and storing it,\" said Rodgers, founder and CEO of Colorado SEO Pros. In addition to programming on the devices themselves, he said, many apps can trigger your gadget's listening device.</p><p> \"Most of this information is in the privacy policy people agree to,\" Rodgers said. \"But do most people read those agreements? No.\"</p><p> There's good reason companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook would want to listen. According to Virginia-based media research firm Comscore Inc., 50% of all searches will be done by voice by the end of this year.</p><p> \"The technology is certainly there to allow detailed listening-in,\" McGinnis said. \"This is not science fiction.\"</p><p> In fact, it would take only seconds, he said, for a smart-speaker maker to pull up audio from a specific hour \u2014 even minute \u2014 and replay the discussions and other sounds that occurred in your home or office or wherever you have a speaker.</p><p> Devices are even talking to one another. TV programmers and advertisers have been quick to enter audio code designed to reach out and message your smart speaker and phone, so they can send you messages or influence searches on your phone or speaker later.</p><p> It's not difficult for a company like Apple, Google or a data broker to figure out which devices are owned by the same person. So when you search for a product with your speaker, you could easily get ads for that or a like product the next time you surf the web on your laptop, tablet or phone.</p><p> Location technology</p><p> Thanks to global positioning systems \u2014 or GPS \u2014 and other increasingly sophisticated location technology, big tech companies already know where you are at almost any given time \u2014 and with surprising precision. Signals are sent back and forth between one of 27 satellites orbiting the Earth 12,000 miles away and the devices you carry.</p><p> Now, technology is in development that is expected to use 3-D models to hone in on where you are within a building.</p><p>Google and other companies, tech experts said, will have the capability within a year to know when you're sitting in bed watching TV. And 5G, with its antennas everywhere, will supercharge the power.</p><p> Although GPS data can be and is used to locate you in an emergency, location data is also a valuable commodity. It tells marketers if you are in their area. It also lets them know what you might be doing and what you might be in the mode to buy.</p><p> According to a report published by India-based research firm MarketsandMarkets, the location analytics market is estimated to grow from $8.2 billion in 2016 to $16.3 billion by 2021. And keep growing.</p><p> Companies like Google and Apple have their own location systems, using information from satellites, cell towers, wireless data points, and even weather and barometric pressure.

Now, some are revisiting their decision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON \u2014 To combat the ills of the internet, federal lawmakers have increasingly focused on a decades-old law that shields tech companies like Facebook and YouTube from liability for content posted by their users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last year, lawmakers approved chipping away at the law, voting overwhelmingly for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/hrpt572/CRPT-115hrpt572-pt1.pdf\">Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act</url>, which holds tech platforms accountable when people use their sites for sex-trafficking schemes. They have since floated other changes as well, like making Facebook or other platforms liable when opioids are sold on their sites. </p><p>But now, as the real-world effects of the sex-trafficking change take hold, some experts and politicians say the results are not all positive. And even some lawmakers who have championed a crackdown on Big Tech are now calling to revisit the change. On Tuesday, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, two of the tech industry\u2019s loudest critics, joined 11 other lawmakers in backing a federal study of its effects.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/hrpt572/CRPT-115hrpt572-pt1.pdf\">Law enforcement officials</url> say that it is sometimes more difficult to track traffickers, because the law pushed them further underground. Advocates say that sex workers now face higher safety risks. The removal of sites advertising sex hinders their ability to vet their clients, the advocates say, and is pushing more of them onto the streets. </p><p>The renewed focus on the 2018 measure  illustrates the difficulty of regulating the internet, including changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the 1996 law that enshrined platforms\u2019 widespread immunity for what their users post. Even when lawmakers reach a consensus that a change is necessary \u2014 as was the case with sex trafficking \u2014 the ramifications can be wider than many expect. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a good test case as we\u2019re looking at other types of carve-outs to Section 230,\u201d said Jeff Kosseff, an expert on the Section 230 protections. Lawyers across the country have also fought to limit the protections, arguing they don\u2019t apply in cases <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/hrpt572/CRPT-115hrpt572-pt1.pdf\">where a digital product</url> is defective. A set of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/hrpt572/CRPT-115hrpt572-pt1.pdf\">anti-trafficking lawsuits in Texas</url> threatens to chip away at the protections as well.</p><p>When lawmakers approved the law last year, it was hailed as a way to catch up to the reality that the bartering of children and adults had moved from the streets to the web. It came after alarming allegations emerged about how Backpage, a classifieds site, may have been playing a role in trafficking.</p><p>Advocates for sex workers warned ahead of the vote in Washington about some of the potential downsides of the law. But they struggled to break through to lawmakers, who were hearing testimony from groups representing trafficking survivors. </p><p>\u201cIt misunderstands the way that trafficking works, if you think that making it less visible reduces the occurrence,\u201d said Kate D\u2019Adamo, an advocate for sex workers\u2019 rights.</p><p>Their concerns have found a broader audience in recent months, even bubbling up on the presidential campaign trail. During a CNN town hall with the Democratic candidates this fall, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/hrpt572/CRPT-115hrpt572-pt1.pdf\">a questioner asked</url> Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who had voted for the bill,  what she would do to \u201ccounteract the negative impact this law has had.\u201d</p><p>Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat of California who was one of the few votes against the bill last year, said he believed Congress should have heard more about those concerns. He helped write the new legislation to study the law after hearing more from sex worker advocates.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t hear the perspective of the impact it\u2019s having on sex workers,\u201d he said of his colleagues. \u201cThis is a cautionary tale that we have to be very deliberate, thoughtful, inclusive in how we regulate the internet.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Khanna said that if a study of the law showed harm to sex workers, he hoped it would bolster the case for a repeal of the 2018 law. </p><p>Many supporters of the 2018 law say it has had a positive effect on the internet, and has helped curb sex trafficking. They note that no site has cropped up to replace Backpage, which was taken down as part of a federal criminal case before the law passed. </p><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut who sponsored the 2018 law, said in a statement that the sex trafficking carve-out was written to \u201cchange tech industry practices,\u201d and that it had succeeded. </p><p>Any website that closed down because of the law, he said, \u201cdid so because it was knowingly facilitating sex trafficking or it was misled by critics of the law.\u201d</p><p>But sex worker advocates point to changes on Craigslist, the classified site, and Reddit, the discussion board. Both sites removed swaths of content that referred to sex because the companies found it too difficult to tell whether people featured in the posts were being trafficked. Craigslist shuttered its personals section, for example, and Reddit closed forums called \u201cEscorts\u201d and \u201cSugarDaddy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAny tool or service can be misused,\u201d Craigslist said in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/crpt/hrpt572/CRPT-115hrpt572-pt1.pdf\">statement</url> at the time, explaining its decision to remove some ads in response to the law. \u201cWe can\u2019t take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services.\u201d </p><p>The company did not respond to recent requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. Kosseff said the moves by Craigslist and other sites demonstrated that even minor changes to Section 230 could alter the venues for speech online.</p><p>\u201cNow, whether that\u2019s good or bad, that really depends on what your goals are,\u201d he said.</p><p>PHOTO: A march in June in support of decriminalizing sex work, and opposed to the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, in Las Vegas.

The paper, titled \u201cCan Africa take the platform economy forward?\u201d, analyses the challenges facing the continent\u2019s platform economy, the path it is likely to follow, and the untapped opportunities for long-established organisations.    Despite several unique challenges across the continent, the platform economy is gaining traction in Africa as consumers and businesses grow more accustomed to online services.    Embodied by the likes of Amazon and Uber, the platform economy refers to value-creating interactions facilitated by digital intermediaries.    Africa\u2019s sophisticated mobile-money market is one of the best-known examples of platform innovation on the continent, which is fast developing alternative infrastructures in response to the dearth of continent-wide traditional digital infrastructure.    As its platform economy takes root, Africa may well draw on the experiences of both India and China, whereby governments work to develop standards and create basic digital capabilities such as identity management, while private companies build out the necessary financial and logistics infrastructure.    At the same time, opportunities exist for traditional African organisations to drive new innovations and develop new operating models in the platform economy.    With their extensive networks and ecosystems of clients and partner organisations, companies that are already deeply entrenched in the African market are well placed to facilitate the growth of the business-to-business sharing economy, in which companies drive efficiencies by sharing services, processes and digital assets.    \u201cBanking groups are among those that could seize this opportunity,\u201d says Kent Marais, head: CIB digital channels at Standard Bank. \u201cFor example, a financial services organisation can provide a digital platform that facilitates value-creating interactions between ecosystem participants \u2013 clients and other partner organisations.\u201d    In this scenario, a corporate banking client that has developed a robust risk-management function could consider taking on the role of a capability provider that on-sells this service to other businesses in the ecosystem.    Platform owners themselves can also on-sell some of their own digital capabilities which they have built up over the years and invested heavily in. For instance, a telecommunications company with a mobile-money platform could provide credit-scoring services to ecommerce platforms keen on offering instalment-based payment options to boost sales.    By participating in the platform economy, organisations have an opportunity to better service clients while also generating new revenue streams.    \u201cGlobally, the current health and economic crisis sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic has brought platform operating models to the fore, and the digital infrastructure providers behind them \u2013 cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google \u2013 are playing a crucial role,\u201d says Sangeet Paul Choudary.    \u201cBut the crisis has also resulted in a stalling of big-tech regulations,\u201d he adds. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, there needs to be a focus on ensuring that we leverage platforms to develop solutions to humanitarian problems, and to ensure that organisations are more efficient and able to withstand this shock and the period that will follow.\u201d    As the Covid-19 pandemic weighs heavily on the African and global economy, it is clear that platform companies are faring better than most. African organisations should consider how they can participate in this segment of the market \u2013 whether that means building and owning platforms themselves or participating in them, or both \u2013 to ensure that they are agile and able to adapt their offerings while also accessing new revenue streams.    The paper, launched digitally, was authored by Choudary and Standard Bank CIB Digital\u2019s Jonathan Lamb and Kent Marais.

The paper, titled \u2018Can Africa take the platform economy forward?\u2019, analyses the challenges facing the continent\u2019s platform economy, the path it is likely to follow, and the untapped opportunities for long-established organisations.   Despite several unique challenges across the continent, the platform economy is gaining traction in Africa as consumers and businesses grow more accustomed to online services.   Embodied by the likes of Amazon and Uber, the platform economy refers to value-creating interactions facilitated by digital intermediaries.   Africa\u2019s sophisticated mobile-money market is one of the best-known examples of platform innovation on the continent, which is fast developing alternative infrastructures in response to the dearth of continent-wide traditional digital infrastructure.   As its platform economy takes root, Africa may well draw on the experiences of both India and China, whereby governments work to develop standards and create basic digital capabilities such as identity management, while private companies build out the necessary financial and logistics infrastructure.   At the same time, opportunities exist for traditional African organisations to drive new innovations and develop new operating models in the platform economy.   With their extensive networks and ecosystems of clients and partner organisations, companies that are already deeply entrenched in the African market are well placed to facilitate the growth of the business-to-business sharing economy, in which companies drive efficiencies by sharing services, processes and digital assets.   \u201cBanking groups are among those that could seize this opportunity,\u201d says Kent Marais, Head: CIB Digital Channels, Standard Bank. \u201cFor example, a financial services organisation can provide a digital platform that facilitates value-creating interactions between ecosystem participants \u2013 clients and other partner organisations\u201d.   In this scenario, a corporate banking client that has developed a robust risk-management function could consider taking on the role of a capability provider that on-sells this service to other businesses in the ecosystem.   Platform owners themselves can also on-sell some of their own digital capabilities which they have built up over the years and invested heavily in. For instance, a telecommunications company with a mobile-money platform could provide credit-scoring services to e-commerce platforms keen on offering instalment-based payment options to boost sales.   By participating in the platform economy, organisations have an opportunity to better service clients while also generating new revenue streams.   \u201cGlobally, the current health and economic crisis sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic has brought platform operating models to the fore, and the digital infrastructure providers behind them \u2013 cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google \u2013 are playing a crucial role,\u201d says Sangeet Paul Choudary.   \u201cBut the crisis has also resulted in a stalling of big-tech regulations,\u201d he adds.\u201cAgainst this backdrop, there needs to be a focus on ensuring that we leverage platforms to develop solutions to humanitarian problems, and to ensure that organisations are more efficient and able to withstand this shock and the period that will follow.\u201d   As the Covid-19 pandemic weighs heavily on the African and global economy, it is clear that platform companies are faring better than most. African organisations should consider how they can participate in this segment of the market \u2013 whether that means building and owning platforms themselves or participating in them, or both \u2013 to ensure that they are agile and able to adapt their offerings while also accessing new revenue streams.

The paper, titled \u2018Can Africa take the platform economy forward?\u2019, analyses the challenges facing the continent\u2019s platform economy, the path it is likely to follow, and the untapped opportunities for long-established organisations.    Despite several unique challenges across the continent, the platform economy is gaining traction in Africa as consumers and businesses grow more accustomed to online services.    Embodied by the likes of Amazon and Uber, the platform economy refers to value-creating interactions facilitated by digital intermediaries.    Africa\u2019s sophisticated mobile-money market is one of the best-known examples of platform innovation on the continent, which is fast developing alternative infrastructures in response to the dearth of continent-wide traditional digital infrastructure.    As its platform economy takes root, Africa may well draw on the experiences of both India and China, whereby governments work to develop standards and create basic digital capabilities such as identity management, while private companies build out the necessary financial and logistics infrastructure.    At the same time, opportunities exist for traditional African organisations to drive new innovations and develop new operating models in the platform economy.    With their extensive networks and ecosystems of clients and partner organisations, companies that are already deeply entrenched in the African market are well placed to facilitate the growth of the business-to-business sharing economy, in which companies drive efficiencies by sharing services, processes and digital assets.    \u201cBanking groups are among those that could seize this opportunity,\u201d says Kent Marais, Head: CIB Digital Channels, Standard Bank. \u201cFor example, a financial services organisation can provide a digital platform that facilitates value-creating interactions between ecosystem participants \u2013 clients and other partner organisations\u201d.    In this scenario, a corporate banking client that has developed a robust risk-management function could consider taking on the role of a capability provider that on-sells this service to other businesses in the ecosystem.    Platform owners themselves can also on-sell some of their own digital capabilities which they have built up over the years and invested heavily in.    For instance, a telecommunications company with a mobile-money platform could provide credit-scoring services to ecommerce platforms keen on offering instalment-based payment options to boost sales.    By participating in the platform economy, organisations have an opportunity to better service clients while also generating new revenue streams.    \u201cGlobally, the current health and economic crisis sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic has brought platform operating models to the fore, and the digital infrastructure providers behind them \u2013 cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google \u2013 are playing a crucial role,\u201d says Sangeet Paul Choudary.    \u201cBut the crisis has also resulted in a stalling of big-tech regulations,\u201d he adds. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, there needs to be a focus on ensuring that we leverage platforms to develop solutions to humanitarian problems, and to ensure that organisations are more efficient and able to withstand this shock and the period that will follow.\u201d    As the Covid-19 pandemic weighs heavily on the African and global economy, it is clear that platform companies are faring better than most.    African organisations should consider how they can participate in this segment of the market \u2013 whether that means building and owning platforms themselves or participating in them, or both \u2013 to ensure that they are agile and able to adapt their offerings while also accessing new revenue streams.

African organisations should consider how they can participate in this segment of the market \u2013 whether that means building and owning platforms themselves or participating in them, or both \u2013 to ensure that they are agile and able to adapt their offerings while also accessing new revenue streams.   The paper, launched digitally, was authored by Choudary and Standard Bank CIB Digital\u2019s Jonathan Lamb and Kent Marais.

Two-thirds of the global population live in our fast-growing markets, and many have living standards below that which they deserve. We are committed to promoting sustainable economic and social development that improves the lives of people across our communities and transforms our markets for the better.</p><p><br/> Progress during 2018<br/> This year's performance was delivered against a largely supportive external environment, but the global economy began to lose some steam as the year progressed, mainly due to two factors. Firstly, the continued trade tensions between the United States and China, which have significantly impacted market confidence and - in some cases - demand. And secondly, the tighter financial conditions we have seen in both emerging and developing markets as the US Federal Reserve gradually increased interest rates during the year.<br/> This is the third year of our current strategy, and our 2018 results reflect further significant progress against our 2015 strategic priorities. Given the improved performance the Board has declared a final ordinary dividend of 15 cents per share, which would result in a full-year dividend for 2018 of 21 cents per share, approximately double the full-year dividend paid last year. We intend to increase the full-year dividend per share over time, as I described in my statement last year. As we progress in the execution of our strategy and build towards a 10 per cent return on tangible equity, the full-year dividend per share has the potential to double by 2021. To the extent additional capital generated over that period is not needed to fund further business growth, the Board will consider optimal ways of returning the excess to shareholders. The Board has also decided to adopt a formulaic approach to setting the interim dividend starting this year, being one-third of the prior year full-year dividend per share.<br/> We have stronger foundations across all dimensions. Income is growing at a rate greater than our costs, credit impairment has notably reduced, underlying profits have increased significantly and our return on tangible equity has improved. But we have not yet reached our objective of achieving double-digit returns. Our shareholders expect this of us and we are determined to deliver it.<br/> We have continued to plant the seeds that will deliver better performance over time. During 2018, we worked to make the bank a better organisation, capable of growing faster by strengthening our performance culture, becoming increasingly client-centric, focusing on the long term, innovating across many fronts and becoming simpler, faster and better. We delivered a negative shareholder return in 2018 in weak global equity market conditions, after two consecutive years of positive progress. I can assure you getting back to growth in that regard is an important Board priority.<br/> Outlook for 2019<br/> While uncertainties, mostly linked to geopolitical and political factors, have increased and global growth has moderated and become less balanced, the global economy is still expected to advance at a reasonably strong rate. The markets in our footprint continue to lead global growth, and substantial opportunities remain across them.<br/> While we are of course not able to shape the external environment, there is much we can do to continue to grow strongly, in a safe and sustainable manner. Later in this report, Bill will set out the areas on which we will focus to develop the Group over the next three years with a view to further improving financial returns.<br/>Standard Chartered PLC - Group Chairman's statement<br/> We must also take time to step back and consider the longer-term regulatory, political, economic, technological and societal drivers of change shaping our business and assess the impact on us. This ensures we will be able to combine the best of the old - in connecting people through trade and commerce - together with the best of the new in innovation, digital technologies and increasing client-centricity. It also enables us to prepare both for the opportunities of the future and the inevitable challenges, which put a premium on both agility and resilience.<br/> As a Board, we have also been paying particular attention to how management develops attractive value propositions for clients, advancing our own digital revolution and becoming more disruptive in our markets. This is particularly important as competition in this space continues to grow, not just from banks, but from fintech and Big Tech companies. These new players are increasingly providing financial services with developed technology platforms and lower costs, often with more limited regulatory obligations at present.<br/> We must also consider how we see the balance between returns and risk. In this context, the Board is supportive of an environment where our colleagues feel freer to innovate, collaborate and grow within the limits defined by our Risk Appetite.<br/> Strengthening our defences<br/> This year, we have been encouraged by the significant further progress we have made in improving our Risk Management Framework across all dimensions, alongside our stronger capital and liquidity position. The fight against financial crime remains paramount to us, both in our operations and in leading and partnering in initiatives to combat it more effectively.<br/> Our enhanced Risk Appetite Statement and our improved attention to non-financial risks are two further key areas which make us stronger, and we have also passed the latest round of the Bank of England stress tests without any caveats.<br/> That said, we are by no means complacent. One risk domain which remains top of mind is cyber risk. We continue to expand our capabilities in this area and enhance our operating models to strengthen our defences and keep pace with ever-evolving cyber threats.<br/> This year, we have also established a newly licensed entity in Frankfurt, which means that we will be able to continue to service our European clients post-Brexit, regardless of the outcome of the EU/UK negotiations.<br/> Helping make the world more sustainable<br/> The world is changing rapidly, and our colleagues, clients and communities face daily economic, environmental and social challenges. At the same time, there are rising expectations about the role banks should play in creating jobs and prosperity, and in protecting the environment. It is our role to lead in taking the difficult decisions to balance environmental, social and economic needs, while listening carefully to our stakeholders - our clients, colleagues, investors, local governments, policymakers and NGOs.<br/> This year, we launched our refreshed public Position Statements, which cover new and tightened requirements that must be met before we can undertake business in industries with high-potential environmental or social impact. This includes our position on power generation, which states we will cease providing financing for new coal-fired power plants anywhere in the world, save where there is an existing commitment.<br/> In 2018, we celebrated 15 years of our Seeing is Believing initiative, surpassing our $100 million fundraising target in the fight against avoidable blindness. The efforts and commitment of our colleagues, as well as the support of our partners, meant that Seeing is Believing has been able to reach more than 176 million people across 37 countries, supported 4.6 million sight-restoring surgeries and trained more than 334,000 health workers since 2003. This is a proud moment for us, and I would like to thank our colleagues for their dedication and the difference they have made to the lives of individuals across our markets.<br/> Drawing on this success, we have set ourselves a new challenge. Through Futuremakers by Standard Chartered, we will raise $50 million between 2019 and 2023 to deliver community programmes that provide disadvantaged young people with the chance to learn new skills and expertise, and improve their chances of getting a job or starting their own business.<br/>Standard Chartered PLC - Group Chairman's statement<br/> Governance and culture<br/> A strong culture and robust governance are essential. The Board continues to strive for a culture of open communication and challenge inside the boardroom, where the Board can hold management accountable for execution and delivery of the Board-approved strategy. We also need to continue setting the tone from the top on the right culture for the Group. Leading by example is today more important than ever. Only fully ethical leadership based on the right values and behaviours can succeed over the longer term. Anything else is a mirage and bound to evaporate sooner or later. It is as much about how we do things as what we do.<br/> Having a strong performance culture should be closely aligned to the Group's values. If we can outperform by making globalisation work through our diversity of markets and people, then we have put a solid stake in the ground about our values throughout all our markets.<br/> At a Board level, our role is to champion this so that our brand promise, Here for good, becomes even more of a reality, always and everywhere. It's the same for conduct - while progress has been made, it remains a crucial task of the Board in overseeing that all our colleagues own our culture and behave consistently with our valued behaviours.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELECT-5483109872RN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELECT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHJ-6B91-JCXB-22HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1576\"/><timeReceived>7:02 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 London Stock Exchange All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (ARNS)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"44026\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This opinion is now more resolute than ever, having seen the Group strengthen its foundations and position itself for stronger and more sustainable growth. One of our Board's key priorities is to ensure we do everything we can to help continue to unlock this potential in pursuit of Our Purpose - driving commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity.  This means that as well as our fiduciary responsibilities to our investors, we have a tremendous responsibility to the communities and societies in which we operate. Two-thirds of the global population live in our fast-growing markets, and many have living standards below that which they deserve. We are committed to promoting sustainable economic and social development that improves the lives of people across our communities and transforms our markets for the better.  Progress during 2018  This year's performance was delivered against a largely supportive external environment, but the global economy began to lose some steam as the year progressed, mainly due to two factors. Firstly, the continued trade tensions between the United States and China, which have significantly impacted market confidence and - in some cases - demand. And secondly, the tighter financial conditions we have seen in both emerging and developing markets as the US Federal Reserve gradually increased interest rates during the year.  This is the third year of our current strategy, and our 2018 results reflect further significant progress against our 2015 strategic priorities. Given the improved performance the Board has declared a final ordinary dividend of 15 cents per share, which would result in a full-year dividend for 2018 of 21 cents per share, approximately double the full-year dividend paid last year. We intend to increase the full-year dividend per share over time, as I described in my statement last year. As we progress in the execution of our strategy and build towards a 10 per cent return on tangible equity, the full-year dividend per share has the potential to double by 2021. To the extent additional capital generated over that period is not needed to fund further business growth, the Board will consider optimal ways of returning the excess to shareholders. The Board has also decided to adopt a formulaic approach to setting the interim dividend starting this year, being one-third of the prior year full-year dividend per share.  We have stronger foundations across all dimensions. Income is growing at a rate greater than our costs, credit impairment has notably reduced, underlying profits have increased significantly and our return on tangible equity has improved. But we have not yet reached our objective of achieving double-digit returns. Our shareholders expect this of us and we are determined to deliver it.  We have continued to plant the seeds that will deliver better performance over time. During 2018, we worked to make the bank a better organisation, capable of growing faster by strengthening our performance culture, becoming increasingly client-centric, focusing on the long term, innovating across many fronts and becoming simpler, faster and better. We delivered a negative shareholder return in 2018 in weak global equity market conditions, after two consecutive years of positive progress. I can assure you getting back to growth in that regard is an important Board priority.  Outlook for 2019  While uncertainties, mostly linked to geopolitical and political factors, have increased and global growth has moderated and become less balanced, the global economy is still expected to advance at a reasonably strong rate. The markets in our footprint continue to lead global growth, and substantial opportunities remain across them.  While we are of course not able to shape the external environment, there is much we can do to continue to grow strongly, in a safe and sustainable manner. Later in this report, Bill will set out the areas on which we will focus to develop the Group over the next three years with a view to further improving financial returns.  &lt;br class=\"je\" /&gt;       Standard Chartered PLC - Group Chairman's statement  We must also take time to step back and consider the longer-term regulatory, political, economic, technological and societal drivers of change shaping our business and assess the impact on us. This ensures we will be able to combine the best of the old - in connecting people through trade and commerce - together with the best of the new in innovation, digital technologies and increasing client-centricity. It also enables us to prepare both for the opportunities of the future and the inevitable challenges, which put a premium on both agility and resilience.  As a Board, we have also been paying particular attention to how management develops attractive value propositions for clients, advancing our own digital revolution and becoming more disruptive in our markets. This is particularly important as competition in this space continues to grow, not just from banks, but from fintech and Big Tech companies. These new players are increasingly providing financial services with developed technology platforms and lower costs, often with more limited regulatory obligations at present.  We must also consider how we see the balance between returns and risk. In this context, the Board is supportive of an environment where our colleagues feel freer to innovate, collaborate and grow within the limits defined by our Risk Appetite.  Strengthening our defences  This year, we have been encouraged by the significant further progress we have made in improving our Risk Management Framework across all dimensions, alongside our stronger capital and liquidity position. The fight against financial crime remains paramount to us, both in our operations and in leading and partnering in initiatives to combat it more effectively.  Our enhanced Risk Appetite Statement and our improved attention to non-financial risks are two further key areas which make us stronger, and we have also passed the latest round of the Bank of England stress tests without any caveats.  That said, we are by no means complacent. One risk domain which remains top of mind is cyber risk. We continue to expand our capabilities in this area and enhance our operating models to strengthen our defences and keep pace with ever-evolving cyber threats.  This year, we have also established a newly licensed entity in Frankfurt, which means that we will be able to continue to service our European clients post-Brexit, regardless of the outcome of the EU/UK negotiations.  Helping make the world more sustainable  The world is changing rapidly, and our colleagues, clients and communities face daily economic, environmental and social challenges. At the same time, there are rising expectations about the role banks should play in creating jobs and prosperity, and in protecting the environment. It is our role to lead in taking the difficult decisions to balance environmental, social and economic needs, while listening carefully to our stakeholders - our clients, colleagues, investors, local governments, policymakers and NGOs.  This year, we launched our refreshed public Position Statements, which cover new and tightened requirements that must be met before we can undertake business in industries with high-potential environmental or social impact. This includes our position on power generation, which states we will cease providing financing for new coal-fired power plants anywhere in the world, save where there is an existing commitment.  In 2018, we celebrated 15 years of our Seeing is Believing initiative, surpassing our $100 million fundraising target in the fight against avoidable blindness. The efforts and commitment of our colleagues, as well as the support of our partners, meant that Seeing is Believing has been able to reach more than 176 million people across 37 countries, supported 4.6 million sight-restoring surgeries and trained more than 334,000 health workers since 2003. This is a proud moment for us, and I would like to thank our colleagues for their dedication and the difference they have made to the lives of individuals across our markets.  Drawing on this success, we have set ourselves a new challenge.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday, January 11th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The shutdown entering day 21. Tied for the longest in U.S. history. President Trump now considering declaring a national emergency and using disaster aid money to fund the border wall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My sacred duty, most sacred duty as president is to defend the people of our nation. That's whether it's from foreign nations or along the border. It's all defending our people. And defending them properly and strongly and really rightly, justly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Meantime futures are showing this this morning. 29 point loss, 30 point loss on the DOW futures. Investors are waiting for some headway, like some evidence that a trade deal is coming together with China, although optimistic about the progress so far.</p><p>Yesterday all three of the major market gauges gained about half of 1 percent, markets on their longest winning streak since early October.</p><p>In Europe, we have some losses to report across the board, in England, France and Germany, although slight there.</p><p>And your Asian markets -- all four major Asian markets finishing higher overnight.</p><p>Oil heading to the plus side this morning. The price of crude oil on its longest upward swing since January of 2010.</p><p>Plus, Hail Mary, details on Apple's plan for a new phone that the company hopes will pull it out of that iPhone sales slump.</p><p>And shark attack, the hit song, \"Baby Shark\", makes history. We will bury it in your head and you will not be able to get rid of it.</p><p>Here with me to break it all down -- CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell; Forbes Media chairman and former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes; and Fox News contributor, 32Advisors founder and CEO, former economic advisor to President Obama -- Robert Wolf. Welcome one and all.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great first hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're such a flatterer.</p><p>WOLF: Great first hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because you're here and you're here and you're here.</p><p>Somebody already called me a nasty name on Twitter. But I'll take that. That's fine.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN: Just think of that shark song. It works with three-year-olds and one-year-olds.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you know the song -- Steve?</p><p>FORBES: I'm not going to hurt your ratings by citing it but my three-year- old can cite it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just love that -- deeply and profoundly. So we'll get to that later this hour.</p><p>But right now our top story -- weighing a national emergency, White House aides exploring new options to fund a southern border wall as lawmakers remain at a standstill over any deal. The White House directing the Army Corps of Engineers to divert money from other areas like disaster relief projects to secure funding if necessary.</p><p>President Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News that a border wall is the only solution.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: It's common sense. It really is, when you think of it, whether you're into the world of law enforcement like these incredible folks behind us (AUDIO GAP) so easily. I mean it would make their job so much better. And they could also go to other areas because we have the wall, you don't need so many people. We would probably pay for that many times in one year.</p><p>The law is very clear. I mean we have the absolute right to declare a national emergency. And this is security stuff. This is a national emergency.</p><p>If you don't have a barrier, whether it's a steel barrier or a concrete wall, substantial and strong, you are never going to solve this problem. You're never going to solve it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining us now Fox News contributor, former speaker of the house and author of \"Trump's America\", Newt Gingrich.</p><p>Mr. Speaker -- it's always a pleasure to see you. I am dying to hear what you have to say about this. What do you say about the President potentially using emergency authority to get this wall built?</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean if the lawyers tell him that it will withstand a court challenge, he has every right to do it. He's commander in chief and the Congress has allocated money for the defense of the United States.</p><p>But I do think that there's a certain value to him fighting this out. Every day that goes by, it's more obvious that the Democrats don't value the safety of Americans nearly as much as they value the convenience of people trying to get here illegally.</p><p>And every day that goes by I think the fact that the Democrats won't compromise, you know, Nancy Pelosi saying if you give me everything I want, I still won't give you the wall. I think that attitude is a really bad way for them to start with a new Congress.</p><p>And so I think in many ways this is a key moment for the President in defining what's at stake for the country and in shaping the next two years.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Will the Republicans continue to stand with him? That's what -- in terms of will their knees buckle or do they have -- do they have the guts --</p><p>GINGRICH: It doesn't matter.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- to stand with him?</p><p>GINGRICH: It doesn't matter. If he's prepared to veto a bill, he's certainly going to keep one-third plus one of the Senate and one-third plus one of the House, so he'll sustain any veto he wants. If some Republicans at the margin want to be timid, they want to be panicked, they want to run in circles, you know, the way our constitutional system works, a president who is tough and determined has enormous advantages.</p><p>And I think that he in many ways can relax and just say -- you know, first of all, Senator McConnell said he won't bring up a bill the President won't sign. So it's not going to go through the Senate.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi can -- you know, she can perform a ballet act, she can dance in circles, she can jump up and down, she would have gymnast -- it won't matter. It's not going to change anything. She can't force it through.</p><p>FORBES: Mr. Speaker, sounds like you don't think the President should declare a national emergency but simply let the thing play out. Is that what you're saying? You'd advise him not to do that? He's winning already, why mess it up?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well look, I think if you got -- I mean first of all, I think what he said all along is the right position. He is not going to sign this appropriation unless they solve --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>FORBES: But you don't think he should do the national emergency?</p><p>GINGRICH: -- commit themselves to solving it.</p><p>FORBES: You're saying he can't but you don't think he should?</p><p>GINGRICH: I think that it is less powerful than winning this fight. He's got to decide what he wants to do. But I always tell people, when you start thinking about any kind of campaign -- military, political -- you always have to say then what. Ok?</p><p>Tomorrow morning he declares a national emergency. It goes to court immediately. But nonetheless, we're moving in the right direction. He can't really declare victory over the Congress. I mean at that point what he's done is had a clever detour to get around the congress and that's not going to solve the long-term problem.</p><p>The long-term problem is Nancy Pelosi who has a crazy wing of her party now, a wing which is totally out of touch with reality. Nancy Pelosi right now thinks that she is the equal to the President.</p><p>I went through this. And we won and ultimately got a very important agreement with President Clinton because we had a principled positive goal. Nancy Pelosi's goal is purely negative.</p><p>Our goal was to get to a balanced budget which as you know, Steve, we were the only people in your lifetime to produce four consecutive balanced budgets. And that came out of having what was tied today as the longest shutdown in history. You don't do these things lightly.</p><p>FORBES: -- which just quickly, Mr. Speaker, gets to another thing. The Democrats are talking about a 70 percent tax rate and all that kind of thing. When are the Republicans going to put something exciting on the table and go on offense, like a flat tax, put something exciting out there for the American people instead of letting the Democrats dominate the agenda on taxes?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, I hope they'll do it pretty quickly. Although I must say, if you want to think about a suicidal party, being the party that runs next year vote for me and I'll raise your taxes to 70 percent, I don't see how a New Yorker survives that. I hope every successful person in New York is looking at what the left wing of the party wants to do to them.</p><p>Because as you know, when you combine state, city and federal taxes, a 70 percent rate just would be a killer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the congresswoman who threw that idea out there, how many days had she been an actual member of Congress. And they put her on \"60 Minutes\" for Pete's sake but that's another problem.</p><p>The government shutdown reaching day 21, Newt -- Mr. Speaker -- which in day 21, that ties the '95, '96 government shutdown under the Clinton administration. You remember this well. You were speaker -- you were just talking about it. You were speaker during the shutdown.</p><p>It was -- if you look back, though, do you have any regrets about what happened back then?</p><p>GINGRICH: No. And I think the Washington establishment is just totally wrong about this. We were the first Republican congress in 40 years. We had a position we believed in deeply. We were prepared to fight over it. The reward was in 1996 we became the first Republican House reelected since 1928.</p><p>I mean all these so-called Washington smart people go around and say boy, that really hurt the Republicans. We're the first people that got reelected in 68 years. And it's because our base believed that we're real, that we were committed to welfare reform. We're committed to the largest capital gains tax cut in history. We're committed to balancing the budget.</p><p>The President has the same thing going for him. I mean he has communicated he's a man of strength. He's a man of determination. He is committed to protecting Americans and I think every day that this goes on, the Democrats are in danger of looking like a party that doesn't care about American lives, doesn't care about American families, and is frankly the party of illegal immigration rather than protecting Americans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to get your reaction to Senator Kamala Harris who dismissed President Trump's border wall fight when she was on the late show with Stephen Colbert. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA: We have hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not going to get paid and they're not getting paid because the President of the United States has a vanity project that he doesn't want to give up. And it is outrageous. It is irresponsible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Vanity project, Mr. Speaker.</p><p>GINGRICH: Look, Kamala Harris represents what I think of as California crazy. I mean California's a state and the governor in California just said we're not only going to be a sanctuary state, we're going to have free healthcare for everybody and the governor of California, the new governor said and \"I specifically mean illegal immigrants\".</p><p>So he's sending a signal to the entire planet, if you can get to California, we'll take care of your health problems for free.</p><p>That is the kind of policies -- the former mayor of San Francisco, a city which now has people in hazmat suits paid $200,000 a year to walk around all day and pick up human feces off the street because there are so many homeless people in San Francisco which is by the way the largest center of capital in the world in the last 25 or 30 years.</p><p>So you have a state which is nuts. You have a senator who has no clue. And you have a governor who is saying basically I'd like to have open borders, be a sanctuary state and everybody who gets here, I will give them a taxpayers cost-free healthcare which, of course, will destroy the California health system.</p><p>I mean I just think there's a certain amount of craziness going on in California and Kamala Harris is just part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I'm putting you down as a no, you're not moving to California.</p><p>GINGRICH: I love California as a state. I just think its politicians have gone crazy. The state's wonderful.</p><p>MCDOWELL: the people are lovely. The state is beautiful. But it's a whole lot of crazy. Mr. Speaker -- thank you so much. Newt Gingrich -- great insight.</p><p>GINGRICH: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I want to bring you this. President Trump's tweet on the wall of the border, \"I often said during rallies with little variation that Mexico will pay for the wall. We have just signed a great new trade deal with Mexico. It is billions of dollars a year. Better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces. The difference pays for the wall many times over.</p><p>There's an issue there, though. That has to get ratified by Congress. Nancy Pelosi, now the new speaker, has to take it up. Will she just put it in her drawer and say bye-bye?</p><p>It's another worry for the markets that we haven't even talked about but we will as the show moves on.</p><p>Coming up, Apple rolling out new gear -- the tech giant unveiling three new iPhone models this year despite slumping sales. That story.</p><p>Plus parents of young children know this song well, \"Baby Shark\" swims into the history books.</p><p>MCDOWELL: U.S. troops have begun withdrawing from Syria.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details. Hey -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey -- Dagen. Yes.</p><p>A U.S. Defense official has now confirmed to Fox News that those troops are being withdrawn on President Trump's orders to pull out of the country. Military officials aren't sharing an exact time line or locations of the troops, of course, for their safety. But the full withdrawal that President Trump is calling for overall may be a bit delayed.</p><p>U.S. National security advisor John Bolton said earlier this week that troops won't be pulled out until ISIS is completely defeated and Kurdish fighters are guaranteed protection from Turkey.</p><p>Well, more trouble for Huawei. The \"Wall Street Journal\" says an executive for the Chinese telecom company has been arrested in Poland and charged with espionage. The suspect is Huawei's local sales director who is a Chinese national. The former deputy head of Poland's IT Security Department also is in custody, we should add. This latest arrests coming amid concerns by the U.S. and other western governments that Beijing is using Huawei, the company, to spy on those countries.</p><p>Well, Apple reportedly is planning to introduce three new LCD iPhones this fall, despite the struggling 10R sales. And yes, I said iPhones.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that Apple is going to unveil new camera features including a triple rear camera for the highest end model. Apple is sticking with LCD this year. But it's considering dropping its LCD models next year.</p><p>AlphaOne Capital Partners' founding partner Dan Niles was on MORNINGS WITH MARIA earlier this week. He said Apple is focusing on the wrong products.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: 5G is a really big deal. If 5G is on the horizon and I know that want to get the latest, greatest on my phone, but an iPhone is not compatible to 5G, why would I buy an iPhone?</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL: That's a really good point. And so I think when you think about 2019, 5G is going to roll out -- it's going to start rolling out to their carriers in the June quarter.</p><p>Well, Apple doesn't have a 5G phone out. So if you're trying to convince somebody hey, you want to spend $1,000. Well, does it have 5G? Well no. So then they'll wait.</p><p>So I think this year could actually be worse than last year in terms of how much the smartphone market shrinks. Apple not having 5G is an even bigger problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: All right. Let's take a look at shares of Apple in the premarket, unchanged right now -- Dagen. And you know, you've also led some great discussions this week on Apple -- Dagen, in particular, how many $1,000 phones do consumers need?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly. And Apple is upping the amount of money that you get on a trade-in, trying to get people to -- to get people into these phones.</p><p>Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lindsey -- I want to get your reaction to something because it's not just Apple. And we're going to talk about it later in the show but the retail. Macy's stock had its worst one day performance ever I think yesterday on weak sales. So again, that was hard on the markets, hard on that sector, for sure.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: For sure. And you know what, I think what surprised me the most is that the conversation yesterday was about the consumer being dense (ph). Not about what was really plaguing retail at the end of third quarter earnings was what about trade and how is that going to impact the cost of goods and things, apparel and things that they're selling.</p><p>I think that this is going to be -- still be a very good holiday sales season, like the Mastercard numbers you got as well as some of the other data we're seeing in retail sales is going to show that there are winners and losers within the retail space. And I think Amazon and Walmart are going to be some of the biggest winners.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Elle Brands which is the owner of Victoria's secret also was down about 5 percent yesterday -- tepid holiday sales. This is a front page story in the \"Wall Street Journal\" which we warned you about because again, women are not buying that garbage that is like some standard of beauty that nobody is not related to anybody's life anymore. And they keep just pushing ahead with this thing from the early '90s.</p><p>You've got be innovative, you've got to be doing e-commerce right. That's where you're going to win.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much. And I will get your response to Speaker Gingrich. I want to know because --</p><p>WOLF: I'm going to wait until we have him back on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you can't. I'm going to make you talk about it.</p><p>Coming up, markets on a winning streak -- we're looking at stocks and how the government shutdown is impacting the IPO market in the New Year.</p><p>And social media's impact, one study finding heavy Facebook use could be impairing your decision making. Details ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The government shutdown now tied for the longest in the nation's history. Tomorrow it will be the longest if it lasts. And it could delay IPOs in 2019 in the New Year.</p><p>Joining us now, PWC partner, head of financial services Neil Dhar. Neal -- great of you to be here.</p><p>NEIL DHAR, PWC PARTNER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's the impact right now?</p><p>DHAR: Right now it's very difficult to get an IPO out in the marketplace because you need a regulator to sort of sign off on the document. There is no regulator at the moment other than emergency things. So what we're seeing is December had a lot of volatility in the marketplace. So it was very slow from an IPO standpoint.</p><p>And now, we're not going to see many things, basically what happens in January is if you don't get IPOs out immediately, then folks will wait for year-end earnings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So isn't this is a blessing for these companies, though, in some way? Because it gives them cover. Kathleen smith, who researches wait for year-end earnings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So isn't this is a blessing for these companies, though, in some way? Because it gives them cover. Because Kathleen Smith, who researches IPOs, was on this program and she thought the market was so rotten at the end of the year that it could be closed for IPOs at least in the first quarter so it gives them a little bit of cover to take some time and wait for the market to recover. Do you agree with that?</p><p>DHAR: Well, I think 2018 was a very good year for IPOs. There was about 215 IPOs which is actually a very good year. Usually anything over 200 we believe is a strong year.</p><p>So we have that momentum. You're right, things did slow down at the back end of the year. Volatility is usually a very big pain point in the unless you get into</p><p>MCDOWELL: She was really talking about the performance in the second half of the year, the companies that did go public.</p><p>DHAR: We did see that. We did see a drop in relation to the IPOs that went out at the beginning of the year, traded up versus the one that's came out at the back end.</p><p>FORBES: And Neil -- I think what you said, volatility is the key point. We have volatility with the government shutdown, with geopolitical risk, with trade, with tax 1.0 versus 2.0, with fiscal, with fed. And a company -- we can live on good and/or bad news. But what we struggle with is when we have no idea what the future may be --</p><p>DHAR: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: -- which is why this government shutdown. The idea that we have regulators not able to work. We have the FDA not able to work. These impact all companies, whether it's going into earnings season or it's going into IPO season or it's going into retail sales. You know, are we going to get the right numbers?</p><p>So what do you tell your customers how to deal with this whole volatile situation?</p><p>DHAR: There's certain things you can control, certain things you can't. So what we see from an IPO to be strong in the marketplace, good management, strong growth, strong cash flows -- that's what they can control from a story standpoint.</p><p>The other stuff, you have to be ready and one of the things that we preach as we help our clients think through this stuff is you've to be ready.</p><p>An IPO is about a nine to 12-month process to get ready. And you never know what's going to happen in a marketplace and when you could actually dip in into the market place in a favorable moment.</p><p>BELL: Can I just ask one question though on IPOs? 81 percent -- I saw a stat from the University of Florida this year were unprofitable companies. That rivals 2000 when we were in the dot-com bubble. So what does that signal about where we are in the cycle of IPOs or maybe even in the business cycle.</p><p>DHAR: Well, we've seen -- IPOs come in a lot of different flavors. You have cash stable companies, a lot of the sponsor backed companies are actually cash stable companies. We have seen a big uptick in relation to get tech and pharma life sciences IPOs.</p><p>And those companies will have that type of profile, strong revenue growth, but potentially loss-making type of companies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: At least it doesn't smack of the same type of companies that were going public back in 2000, companies that just seemed really ridiculous that barely had a business plan.</p><p>I don't think that -- at least I don't get the same sensation.</p><p>DHAR: And there's a lot more diligence in relation to what the investors are asking for, what companies are being asked on the road shows, the level of diligence feels different.</p><p>FORBES: I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Neil it's good to see you. I've lived through -- thank God I lived through that.</p><p>Neil Dhar -- Good to see you.</p><p>DHAR: Thanks again.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up taking on big technology, our next guest says that customers and congress need to stand up to some of the biggest companies in the world.</p><p>Plus, baby shark attack.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The YouTube children's song, now a historical success. The story has parents everywhere bopping and shaking their heads.</p><p>We make Steve Forbes sing it, coming up.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday, January 11th. Your top stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>The shutdown showdown enters day 21. Now tied for the longest in U.S. history. President Trump considering declaring a national emergency and using disaster aid to fund the border wall.</p><p>Futures are heading lower this morning, ever so slight. Tough to make the connection between the shutdown and the markets at this point because we've had a great run. We've got a 20 point loss on the Dow Futures right now. The major markets gauges gained about half of one percent yesterday and they're on track for their longest winning streak since early October, but really before that massive selloff at the end of the year.</p><p>In Europe we have some selling to report in England, France and Germany, although slight, losses of about half of one percent in France and Germany at the moment.</p><p>Asia markets, different story, finishing higher overnight, all four there.</p><p>Recall alert, FiatChrysler warning of a potentially dangerous flaw impacting 1.6 million vehicles but there's an even bigger issue. We have the details.</p><p>Then addicted to Facebook, we'll tell you about new research that says using the social media app could be as bad as a cocaine addiction.</p><p>And shark attack, the hit song baby shark making history.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, taking on technology. Companies like Facebook and Google are bigger than ever. In fact, the number of Facebook users now exceeds the populations of China, the United States and Brazil combined. Google oversees 90 percent of all online searches. Between those two companies, they control roughly two-thirds of all advertising online.</p><p>My next guest says there more has to be done to rein these companies in. She has an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle, consumers, congress: stand up to tech giants, saying this. When a small cadre of companies begins to operate as retailers, news aggregators, advertising platforms and information keepers, they don't just rise to the top of the marketplace, they become the marketplace. Walling off competition in a way that threatens the very idea of consumer choice.</p><p>Joining me now, consumer reports president and CEO, Marta Tellado. Good to see you Marta this morning.</p><p>MARTA TELLADO, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, CONSUMER REPORTS: Great to be here, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What do you mean by this op-ed? What should consumers do? What should Congress do?</p><p>TELLADO: Well, think about it. Our founders were great believers in the free market and competition but the thing about free market, you also need free choice. How do consumers have free choice when they don't have knowledge or transparency about what's in the marketplace? So we need transparency. We need accountability. We also need some changes. The physics of this new reality are very different.</p><p>So, we don't really have the rules and regulations in place to even think and contemplate how to hold these companies accountable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When you say rules and regulations, though, Steve's neck turns bright red. But Steve, do you -- what do you have to say to Marta's editorial?</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Well, in terms of regulations, I think again, you're going to get national regulations if only because states are starting to do crazy things. You don't want to vulcanized market which would hurt everybody. So I think it's a preemption. You will get something national.</p><p>But in terms of -- in terms of getting information out there, it's as open as it's ever been before. What I want to ask you is, we said the same thing about IBM, said the same thing about Microsoft, said the same thing about Walmart, Amazon, now we say about Amazon. Aren't there things they're going out there that are going to upend these people like 5G or new technologies that are going to undo them like they've always done before?</p><p>TELLADO: Here's the difference, I think it's yes, we have seen behavior like this before. We haven't quite seen so few companies like big tech that are controlling so much. As I said in the op-ed, they're not just tech companies, they are ad platforms. They are retailers. They are controlling our experience.</p><p>So the dynamic, it's not just what we've seen before. The physics of this are entirely different. It's too few of them and not enough transparency for consumers to make decisions and --</p><p>FORBES: Do you think block chain technology, have you look at that as a way of getting our privacy back?</p><p>TELLADO: People are talking about block chain technology, Bitcoin. Those things are thought about, talked about, they're not a reality for everyday consumers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What about personal choice, Aurora? I know you want to get in here. But again, if consumers just turn their backs on some of these companies in a way, it's different if you talk about the way that ads are served online and that's tougher. But in terms of Facebook, people could just stop using the platform and really pull back and maybe that would give rise to alternatives who would be -- with companies that would be more transparent. But that just seems like a really long road ahead.</p><p>TELLADO: I think you're seeing that already and particularly with young audiences turning away from Facebook. But the choices are not there and the information they need, these companies are not being transparent about the information they're using. Consumers are really being victimized by these incredible technologies that are delighting us but they're also limiting our choice in terms of pricing, in terms of the whole experience that we have in our daily lives.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: So Marta, you know, it's a bit of a double edged sword because I love what you wrote. But we applaud the shared services economy because it makes it, one, more efficient for us all. Two, actually pricing has gone down, not up in the shared services economy. So, in a consumer driven country like ours which is 73 percent consumer driven to the head of consumer -- to your company, that's a good thing.</p><p>TELLADO: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: Now, on the flip side, I agree with you on the regulation side. Because isn't Facebook and these companies, shouldn't they be regulated no different than the Wall Street Journal and Fox because really they dominate advertising, they dominate -- you know, eyeballs. And I think that's what you're saying, that there has to be a level playing field for what I would say is the more mature companies or the older school companies that are innovating maybe at the same pace, but they don't yet have a oligopoly and monopoly (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL: And to that point, Congress could remove the liability waiver that these social media companies have. They have a liability waiver for user generated content because they say they're not media companies. So, that is something that Congress could do, but go ahead.</p><p>TELLADO: But let me get to something you said, Robert, and that is about price and quality. Yes, we're seeing great stuff there. What we're not seeing -- we're seeing price and quality. But what about privacy and security? I don't think that things on the books today even come close to addressing that.</p><p>WOLF: Well that's why I'm a supporter of block chain protocol. I think it's going to -- I think it's going to proliferate a lot faster than the marketplace.</p><p>TELLADO: And we're anxious to see that. But in -- but in the meantime, what are the standards by which consumers can go into the marketplace and make choices about products were in privacy and security and there aren't. And which is what -- that's caused us to innovate as well. So what we're doing is we have developed a whole series of tests and protocols so that consumers can actually make a choice about which period -- payment app is going to be the safest for them, and that's exactly what we did.</p><p>And guess what, as soon as we started testing and creating these standards, companies started competing against them and saying we want to be number one, we want to have the best smart T.V. that protects your privacy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>TELLADO: So, there are ways to incentivize. It's not all just regulation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The problem is that you touch on, is that there is all the power is in a few hands. You talk about millennials leaving Facebook. Well, they're using Instagram which Facebook owns.</p><p>TELLADO: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I never understood why that was allowed to happen. Again, these nerd robber barons who are controlling all of our information and tracking everything that we do.</p><p>TELLADO: Well, I think what all these companies are really excelling at in addition to delighting us is being consumer trust busters. I mean, consumer trust right now is at an all-time low.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Marta, great to see you. Tellado, did I say it right?</p><p>TELLADO: You did indeed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK, great. That was very important to me. Marta, great to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>TELLADO: Great to be here, thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's our highlight reel from this week. Must see moments from the show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president doesn't want a government shutdown. He wants the government to open, but he also wants it to do its job.</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE: The shutdown is not good. But my bigger complaint is that America may be because of bipartisan politics has been unable to do a lot of things that need to be done. If your one of those folks out there, you're a J.P. Morgan Chase client, we're going to help you. Call in and we're going to get you some help deferring payments.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: How long can the credit markets stay this tight before you actually do see it as a worry sign?</p><p>DIMON: For a while. I'm really not worried about it. I think -- I think you're just having -- if you look at it the other way around, credit spreads were abnormally low for a long time. This is more maybe a little bit of a normalization. And you know, you and I both know that the tip of the ice -- the tip of the spear is IPOs and high yield. So when people -- when sentiment changes dramatically those are usually the first two areas where people cut back and then they kind of open up over time.</p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR, ALLIANZ: In 12 months we've gone from the hope of synchronized pick up in global growth with everybody doing better to divergence with the U.S. outpacing Europe and China. And now, we're worried about the wrong type of convergence. We're worried about the U.S. slowing to the rest of the world instead of the rest of the world picking up towards us.</p><p>It's for the Fed to realize that it can't be on auto pilot. That it has to be more sensitive to what's happening not just in the U.S. economy, but also to what's happening globally.</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS: Not sure Apple realizes the real issue is that they're trying to sell a Ferrari in the market that can afford a Ford. This is why Apple's been losing market shares. They actually went from the second largest vendor of phones in the world, Huawei passed them out of China to become the second largest.</p><p>KEN FRAZIER, CEO, MERCK: We want to work with the administration and Congress, both parties to ensure that patients can have meaningful access to drugs and affordability is a real problem. The question is, how do we solve the affordability problem for today's patients. We've shown already that Keytruda as immunotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy can significantly reduce the amount of deaths. So, with respect to newly diagnosed people with the most common form of lung cancer called non squamous lung cancer we're able to reduce the death rate by 51 percent. There's never been anything like that.</p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL ANALYST: Started Amazon during their marriage, dollar for dollar it was amassed during that marriage, right down the middle, 50 percent generally would go to the spouse. Anything that he comes out with a statement that can impact the shares of stock and the value of it can result in a shareholder derivative suit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Harley Davidson unveiling a new motorcycle later this year. Joining us right now is Harley Davidson chief marketing officer Heather Malenshek.</p><p>HEATHER MALENSHEK, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, HARLEY DAVIDSON: As we think about -- I mean, electric vehicles they're becoming much more mainstream but two-wheel mobility -- electric two-wheel mobility is relatively new trend and we are setting out to lead the electrification of motorcycling. So, this is all part of our More Roads plan that we launched last year, which was around broader access to the brands, so opening up new markets and new channels.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Trump continues to tweet this morning. H1B holders, he's talking about visas. H1B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay including a potential path to citizenship. We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S. That's a biggy -- that is a biggy -- that is --</p><p>FORBES: That may lay the basis for resolving this crisis because it gives something that California H1B visas have been severely restricted. You start to throw that out there, along with DACA, you've got a deal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Steve drops the mic. FiatChrysler meantime issuing a major recall over potentially dangerous flaws. Cheryl Casone has the details that you need to know, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, this is interesting, Dagen. FiatChrysler recalling more than 1.6 million vehicles worldwide to replace Takata airbags. These airbags can explode with too much force and send shrapnel flying. The affected models include the 2010 through 2016 Jeep Wrangler and the 2010 Ram pickup. This is the third recall over Takata airbags just this week alone. At the recalls by Toyota and Ford. And Takata as you know, it's been in the news for years over airbag troubles. Chrysler, the stock down 28 percent from one year ago.</p><p>Well, a new study finding that heavy Facebook users make impaired decisions like similar to drug addicts basically. Researchers tested about 70 participants with an exercise. Psychologist used to measure decision making. Based on the people who admitted being excessive Facebook users did worse on the test than those who didn't use Facebook as often. Shares of Facebook are lower in the premarket, down more than half a percent.</p><p>And then finally, parents of young children, you should be so excited because the song baby shark has become a smash hit with little kids and now it is on this week's billboard hot 100.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo. Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo. Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo. Baby shark!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: This music video has racked up more than 2.1 billion views on YouTube. The song has actually been around since 2015. But it got popular last week -- last year, excuse me, when a social media challenge asked listeners to record themselves doing this is the baby shark dance. So yes, if you have young kids at home, you thought frozen was bad mom and dad, get ready for baby shark, I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's Steve, baby shark doo doo doo doo doo doo. Steve's doing it. I'm going to be doing that all day long.</p><p>FORBES: We've got two young grandchildren, three and-a-half and one and-a- half, and the only way they eat food is you have that device in front of them playing baby shark. We sing along with them. They eat the food. It's great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was helpful hints from grandfather Steve Forbes.</p><p>FORBES: Meet all needs here. Markets, parenting, babies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, we address -- we address everyone's needs, absolutely.</p><p>Coming up, healthy food for man's best friend. We talk to one company that wants your dog eating as well as you, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Delicious, delectable, high end dog food, a new personalized pet meal start-up called The Farmer's Dog boasts that meals are made -- freshly made and healthy even humans can eat them and they're delivered to your door.</p><p>Joining me now, the co-founders of The Farmer's Dog Brett Podolsky and Jonathan Regev. Jonathan and good to see you both. And Brett, to you first.</p><p>BRETT PODOLSKY, CO-FOUNDER, THE FARMER'S DOG: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, I'm going to hold up this delicious bowl of -- it looks like tuna and corn, and broccoli and squash and carrots. So this is not just for people but for your dog.</p><p>JONATHAN REGEV, CO-FOUNDER, THE FARMER'S DOG: Yes, it's for your dog. It's actually turkey.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Turkey. It looks delicious. But how did you guys come up with the idea for the -- for the company?</p><p>PODOLSKY: Well, it all started with my dog, Jada. She was sick for the first two years that I had her. I was desperate to find the solution for her. And after trying every pet food and going to several vets, finally a vet recommended that I tried home cooking for her and it was like magic, all of her symptoms disappeared.</p><p>And it made me wonder what was going on with pet food because I used -- the vet recommended that I use the exact same ingredients that were on the pet food label that I had been feeding her. But when I cooked it, the result was very different. It wasn't brown balls, it looked like actual food. And her stomach symptoms were cured.</p><p>So, I wanted something better for her. And after doing a lot of research into the pet industry and for anybody that has done any research into how they make pet food, it's pretty alarming. So, I wanted something better for her. And after realizing there was just no companies out there that I felt comfortable feeding her, we decided to build that company.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, how did you build the company, Jonathan? How did you -- how are you getting this message out to consumers who might just be ordering their dog food from Amazon?</p><p>REGEV: Sure, yes. So, at first, we really didn't focus on marketing. It was really difficult and complicated to create the supply chain needed. And also, the technology to create a subscription to have food look like this.</p><p>Because remember, this food in particular, it's not meant to look pretty. And it's not meant to look fancy. It's just -- you know, fresh food.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it does look fresh -- it does look fresh.</p><p>REGEV: And it is fresh. And so that -- to do that in an affordable way and also to make the food very convenient to feed, that was where the difficulty was. So, we really didn't focus on marketing for the first three years or so. It really grew by word of mouth.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, how are you selling it? Brett, how is -- how are -- is the dog food sold essentially? Like, do you advertise on podcasts? It's direct to consumer? Are you in stores at all?</p><p>REGEV: Yes, so we're just -- we're just starting to now. So, it's online only and it's direct to consumer. Because direct to consumer is the really -- the only way that we could keep the food fresh and convenient.</p><p>So, basically how that works is you go online, you enter your dog's information. And we take all of that into account. We create a custom plan for them and then that feeds back into our very complicated supply chain that can then deliver the food fresh. So food actually comes in this package, right, so it's personalized for your dog.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You can hand it to me.</p><p>REGEV: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thanks.</p><p>REGEV: So, it's pre-portioned for your dog.

I'm Dagen  McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Friday, January 11th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The shutdown entering day 21.  Tied for the longest in U.S. history.   President Trump now considering declaring a national emergency and using  disaster aid money to fund the border wall.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My sacred duty, most sacred  duty as president is to defend the people of our nation.  That's whether  it's from foreign nations or along the border.  It's all defending our  people.  And defending them properly and strongly and really rightly,  justly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Meantime futures are showing this this morning.  29 point loss,  30 point loss on the DOW futures.  Investors are waiting for some headway,  like some evidence that a trade deal is coming together with China,  although optimistic about the progress so far.</p><p> Yesterday all three of the major market gauges gained about half of 1  percent, markets on their longest winning streak since early October.</p><p> In Europe, we have some losses to report across the board, in England,  France and Germany, although slight there.</p><p> And your Asian markets -- all four major Asian markets finishing higher  overnight.</p><p> Oil heading to the plus side this morning.  The price of crude oil on its  longest upward swing since January of 2010. </p><p> Plus, Hail Mary, details on Apple's plan for a new phone that the company  hopes will pull it out of that iPhone sales slump.</p><p> And shark attack, the hit song, \"Baby Shark\", makes history.  We will bury  it in your head and you will not be able to get rid of it.</p><p> Here with me to break it all down -- CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell; Forbes Media chairman and former Republican presidential candidate,  Steve Forbes; and Fox News contributor, 32Advisors founder and CEO, former  economic advisor to President Obama -- Robert Wolf.  Welcome one and all.  </p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:   Great first hour.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're such a flatterer.  </p><p> WOLF:  Great first hour.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because you're here and you're here and you're here.</p><p> Somebody already called me a nasty name on Twitter.  But I'll take that.   That's fine.  </p><p> STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN:  Just think of that shark song.  It  works with three-year-olds and one-year-olds.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you know the song -- Steve?  </p><p> FORBES:  I'm not going to hurt your ratings by citing it but my three-year- old can cite it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just love that -- deeply and profoundly.  So we'll get to that  later this hour.</p><p> But right now our top story -- weighing a national emergency, White House  aides exploring new options to fund a southern border wall as lawmakers  remain at a standstill over any deal.  The White House directing the Army  Corps of Engineers to divert money from other areas like disaster relief  projects to secure funding if necessary.</p><p> President Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News that a border wall is the  only solution.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  It's common sense.  It really is, when you think of it, whether  you're into the world of law enforcement like these incredible folks behind  us (AUDIO GAP) so easily.  I mean it would make their job so much better.   And they could also go to other areas because we have the wall, you don't  need so many people.  We would probably pay for that many times in one  year.</p><p> The law is very clear.  I mean we have the absolute right to declare a  national emergency.  And this is security stuff.  This is a national  emergency.</p><p> If you don't have a barrier, whether it's a steel barrier or a concrete  wall, substantial and strong, you are never going to solve this problem.   You're never going to solve it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us now Fox News contributor, former speaker of the house  and author of \"Trump's America\", Newt Gingrich.</p><p> Mr. Speaker -- it's always a pleasure to see you.  I am dying to hear what  you have to say about this.  What do you say about the President  potentially using emergency authority to get this wall built?  </p><p> NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I mean if the lawyers tell him  that it will withstand a court challenge, he has every right to do it.   He's commander in chief and the Congress has allocated money for the  defense of the United States.</p><p> But I do think that there's a certain value to him fighting this out.   Every day that goes by, it's more obvious that the Democrats don't value  the safety of Americans nearly as much as they value the convenience of  people trying to get here illegally.  </p><p> And every day that goes by I think the fact that the Democrats won't  compromise, you know, Nancy Pelosi saying if you give me everything I want,  I still won't give you the wall.  I think that attitude is a really bad way  for them to start with a new Congress.</p><p> And so I think in many ways this is a key moment for the President in  defining what's at stake for the country and in shaping the next two years.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Will the Republicans continue to stand with him?  That's what --  in terms of will their knees buckle or do they have -- do they have the  guts -- </p><p> GINGRICH:  It doesn't matter.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- to stand with him?</p><p> GINGRICH:  It doesn't matter.  If he's prepared to veto a bill, he's  certainly going to keep one-third plus one of the Senate and one-third plus  one of the House, so he'll sustain any veto he wants.  If some Republicans  at the margin want to be timid, they want to be panicked, they want to run  in circles, you know, the way our constitutional system works, a president  who is tough and determined has enormous advantages.</p><p> And I think that he in many ways can relax and just say -- you know, first  of all, Senator McConnell said he won't bring up a bill the President won't  sign.  So it's not going to go through the Senate.</p><p> Nancy Pelosi can -- you know, she can perform a ballet act, she can dance  in circles, she can jump up and down, she would have gymnast -- it won't  matter.  It's not going to change anything.  She can't force it through.  </p><p> FORBES:  Mr. Speaker, sounds like you don't think the President should  declare a national emergency but simply let the thing play out.  Is that  what you're saying?  You'd advise him not to do that?  He's winning  already, why mess it up?  </p><p> GINGRICH:  Well look, I think if you got -- I mean first of all, I think  what he said all along is the right position.  He is not going to sign this  appropriation unless they solve -- </p><p> (CROSSTALKING)</p><p> FORBES:  But you don't think he should do the national emergency?  </p><p> GINGRICH:  -- commit themselves to solving it.</p><p> FORBES:  You're saying he can't but you don't think he should?  </p><p> GINGRICH:  I think that it is less powerful than winning this fight.  He's  got to decide what he wants to do.  But I always tell people, when you  start thinking about any kind of campaign -- military, political -- you  always have to say then what.  Ok?</p><p> Tomorrow morning he declares a national emergency.  It goes to court  immediately.  But nonetheless, we're moving in the right direction.  He  can't really declare victory over the Congress.  I mean at that point what  he's done is had a clever detour to get around the congress and that's not  going to solve the long-term problem. </p><p> The long-term problem is Nancy Pelosi who has a crazy wing of her party  now, a wing which is totally out of touch with reality.  Nancy Pelosi right  now thinks that she is the equal to the President.</p><p> I went through this.  And we won and ultimately got a very important  agreement with President Clinton because we had a principled positive goal.   Nancy Pelosi's goal is purely negative.  </p><p> Our goal was to get to a balanced budget which as you know, Steve, we were  the only people in your lifetime to produce four consecutive balanced  budgets.  And that came out of having what was tied today as the longest  shutdown in history.  You don't do these things lightly.  </p><p> FORBES:  -- which just quickly, Mr. Speaker, gets to another thing.  The  Democrats are talking about a 70 percent tax rate and all that kind of  thing.  When are the Republicans going to put something exciting on the  table and go on offense, like a flat tax, put something exciting out there  for the American people instead of letting the Democrats dominate the  agenda on taxes?  </p><p> GINGRICH:  Well, I hope they'll do it pretty quickly.  Although I must say,  if you want to think about a suicidal party, being the party that runs next  year vote for me and I'll raise your taxes to 70 percent, I don't see how a  New Yorker survives that.  I hope every successful person in New York is  looking at what the left wing of the party wants to do to them.</p><p> Because as you know, when you combine state, city and federal taxes, a 70  percent rate just would be a killer.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the congresswoman who threw that idea out there, how many  days had she been an actual member of Congress.  And they put her on \"60  Minutes\" for Pete's sake but that's another problem.</p><p> The government shutdown reaching day 21, Newt -- Mr. Speaker -- which in  day 21, that ties the '95, '96 government shutdown under the Clinton  administration.  You remember this well.  You were speaker -- you were just  talking about it.  You were speaker during the shutdown.</p><p> It was -- if you look back, though, do you have any regrets about what  happened back then?  </p><p> GINGRICH:  No.  And I think the Washington establishment is just totally  wrong about this.  We were the first Republican congress in 40 years.  We  had a position we believed in deeply.  We were prepared to fight over it.   The reward was in 1996 we became the first Republican House reelected since  1928.</p><p> I mean all these so-called Washington smart people go around and say boy,  that really hurt the Republicans.  We're the first people that got  reelected in 68 years.  And it's because our base believed that we're real,  that we were committed to welfare reform.  We're committed to the largest  capital gains tax cut in history.  We're committed to balancing the budget.</p><p> The President has the same thing going for him.  I mean he has communicated  he's a man of strength.  He's a man of determination.  He is committed to  protecting Americans and I think every day that this goes on, the Democrats  are in danger of looking like a party that doesn't care about American  lives, doesn't care about American families, and is frankly the party of  illegal immigration rather than protecting Americans.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get your reaction to Senator Kamala Harris who  dismissed President Trump's border wall fight when she was on the late show  with Stephen Colbert.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  We have hundreds of thousands of  Americans who are not going to get paid and they're not getting paid  because the President of the United States has a vanity project that he  doesn't want to give up.  And it is outrageous.  It is irresponsible.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Vanity project, Mr. Speaker.  </p><p> GINGRICH:  Look, Kamala Harris represents what I think of as California  crazy.  I mean California's a state and the governor in California just  said we're not only going to be a sanctuary state, we're going to have free  healthcare for everybody and the governor of California, the new governor  said and \"I specifically mean illegal immigrants\".</p><p> So he's sending a signal to the entire planet, if you can get to  California, we'll take care of your health problems for free.</p><p> That is the kind of policies -- the former mayor of San Francisco, a city  which now has people in hazmat suits paid $200,000 a year to walk around  all day and pick up human feces off the street because there are so many  homeless people in San Francisco which is by the way the largest center of  capital in the world in the last 25 or 30 years.</p><p> So you have a state which is nuts.  You have a senator who has no clue.   And you have a governor who is saying basically I'd like to have open  borders, be a sanctuary state and everybody who gets here, I will give them  a taxpayers cost-free healthcare which, of course, will destroy the  California health system.</p><p> I mean I just think there's a certain amount of craziness going on in  California and Kamala Harris is just part of it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So I'm putting you down as a no, you're not moving to  California.  </p><p> GINGRICH:  I love California as a state.  I just think its politicians have  gone crazy.  The state's wonderful.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  the people are lovely.  The state is beautiful.  But it's a  whole lot of crazy.  Mr. Speaker -- thank you so much.  Newt Gingrich --  great insight.</p><p> GINGRICH: Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I want to bring you this.  President Trump's tweet on the  wall of the border, \"I often said during rallies with little variation that  Mexico will pay for the wall.  We have just signed a great new trade deal  with Mexico.  It is billions of dollars a year.  Better than the very bad  NAFTA deal which it replaces.  The difference pays for the wall many times  over.</p><p> There's an issue there, though.  That has to get ratified by Congress.   Nancy Pelosi, now the new speaker, has to take it up.  Will she just put it  in her drawer and say bye-bye? </p><p> It's another worry for the markets that we haven't even talked about but we  will as the show moves on.</p><p> Coming up, Apple rolling out new gear -- the tech giant unveiling three new  iPhone models this year despite slumping sales.  That story.</p><p> Plus parents of young children know this song well, \"Baby Shark\" swims into  the history books.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  U.S. troops have begun withdrawing from Syria.</p><p> Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hey -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey -- Dagen.  Yes.</p><p> A U.S. Defense official has now confirmed to Fox News that those troops are  being withdrawn on President Trump's orders to pull out of the country.   Military officials aren't sharing an exact time line or locations of the  troops, of course, for their safety.  But the full withdrawal that  President Trump is calling for overall may be a bit delayed.</p><p> U.S. National security advisor John Bolton said earlier this week that  troops won't be pulled out until ISIS is completely defeated and Kurdish  fighters are guaranteed protection from Turkey.</p><p> Well, more trouble for Huawei.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" says an executive  for the Chinese telecom company has been arrested in Poland and charged  with espionage.  The suspect is Huawei's local sales director who is a  Chinese national.  The former deputy head of Poland's IT Security  Department also is in custody, we should add.  This latest arrests coming  amid concerns by the U.S. and other western governments that Beijing is  using Huawei, the company, to spy on those countries.</p><p> Well, Apple reportedly is planning to introduce three new LCD iPhones this  fall, despite the struggling 10R sales.  And yes, I said iPhones.</p><p> The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that Apple is going to unveil new  camera features including a triple rear camera for the highest end model.   Apple is sticking with LCD this year.  But it's considering dropping its  LCD models next year.</p><p>AlphaOne Capital Partners' founding partner Dan Niles was on MORNINGS WITH  MARIA earlier this week.  He said Apple is focusing on the wrong products.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  5G is a really big deal.  If  5G is on the horizon and I know that want to get the latest, greatest on my  phone, but an iPhone is not compatible to 5G, why would I buy an iPhone?  </p><p> DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL:  That's a really good point.   And so I think when you think about 2019, 5G is going to roll out -- it's  going to start rolling out to their carriers in the June quarter.</p><p> Well, Apple doesn't have a 5G phone out.  So if you're trying to convince  somebody hey, you want to spend $1,000.  Well, does it have 5G?  Well no.   So then they'll wait.</p><p> So I think this year could actually be worse than last year in terms of how  much the smartphone market shrinks.  Apple not having 5G is an even bigger  problem.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE: All right.  Let's take a look at shares of Apple in the premarket,  unchanged right now -- Dagen.  And you know, you've also led some great  discussions this week on Apple -- Dagen, in particular, how many $1,000  phones do consumers need?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  And Apple is upping the amount of money that you get  on a trade-in, trying to get people to -- to get people into these phones.</p><p> Thank you so much -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey -- I want to get your reaction to something because it's  not just Apple.  And we're going to talk about it later in the show but the  retail.  Macy's stock had its worst one day performance ever I think  yesterday on weak sales.  So again, that was hard on the markets, hard on  that sector, for sure.  </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  For sure.  And you know what, I  think what surprised me the most is that the conversation yesterday was  about the consumer being dense (ph).  Not about what was really plaguing  retail at the end of third quarter earnings was what about trade and how is  that going to impact the cost of goods and things, apparel and things that  they're selling.</p><p> I think that this is going to be -- still be a very good holiday sales  season, like the Mastercard numbers you got as well as some of the other  data we're seeing in retail sales is going to show that there are winners  and losers within the retail space.  And I think Amazon and Walmart are  going to be some of the biggest winners.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Elle Brands which is the owner of Victoria's secret also  was down about 5 percent yesterday -- tepid holiday sales.  This is a front  page story in the \"Wall Street Journal\" which we warned you about because  again, women are not buying that garbage that is like some standard of  beauty that nobody is not related to anybody's life anymore.  And they keep  just pushing ahead with this thing from the early '90s.  </p><p> You've got be innovative, you've got to be doing e-commerce right.  That's  where you're going to win.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  And I will get your response to Speaker  Gingrich.  I want to know because -- </p><p> WOLF:  I'm going to wait until we have him back on.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you can't.  I'm going to make you talk about it.  </p><p> Coming up, markets on a winning streak -- we're looking at stocks and how  the government shutdown is impacting the IPO market in the New Year.</p><p> And social media's impact, one study finding heavy Facebook use could be  impairing your decision making.  Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The government shutdown now tied for the longest in the nation's  history.  Tomorrow it will be the longest if it lasts.  And it could delay  IPOs in 2019 in the New Year.</p><p> Joining us now, PWC partner, head of financial services Neil Dhar.  Neal --  great of you to be here.</p><p> NEIL DHAR, PWC PARTNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> MCDOWELL: What's the impact right now?</p><p> DHAR:  Right now it's very difficult to get an IPO out in the marketplace  because you need a regulator to sort of sign off on the document.  There is  no regulator at the moment other than emergency things.  So what we're  seeing is December had a lot of volatility in the marketplace.  So it was  very slow from an IPO standpoint.</p><p> And now, we're not going to see many things, basically what happens in  January is if you don't get IPOs out immediately, then folks will wait for  year-end earnings.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So isn't this is a blessing for these companies, though, in some  way?  Because it gives them cover.  Kathleen smith, who researches wait for  year-end earnings.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So isn't this is a blessing for these companies, though, in some  way?  Because it gives them cover.  Because Kathleen Smith, who researches  IPOs, was on this program and she thought the market was so rotten at the  end of the year that it could be closed for IPOs at least in the first  quarter so it gives them a little bit of cover to take some time and wait  for the market to recover.  Do you agree with that?  </p><p> DHAR:  Well, I think 2018 was a very good year for IPOs.  There was about  215 IPOs which is actually a very good year.  Usually anything over 200 we  believe is a strong year.</p><p> So we have that momentum.  You're right, things did slow down at the back  end of the year.  Volatility is usually a very big pain point in the unless  you get into </p><p> MCDOWELL:  She was really talking about the performance in the second half  of the year, the companies that did go public.  </p><p> DHAR:  We did see that.  We did see a drop in relation to the IPOs that  went out at the beginning of the year, traded up versus the one that's came  out at the back end.  </p><p> FORBES:  And Neil -- I think what you said, volatility is the key point.   We have volatility with the government shutdown, with geopolitical risk,  with trade, with tax 1.0 versus 2.0, with fiscal, with fed.  And a company  -- we can live on good and/or bad news.  But what we struggle with is when  we have no idea what the future may be -- </p><p> DHAR:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  -- which is why this government shutdown.  The idea that we have  regulators not able to work.  We have the FDA not able to work.  These  impact all companies, whether it's going into earnings season or it's going  into IPO season or it's going into retail sales.  You know, are we going to  get the right numbers?</p><p> So what do you tell your customers how to deal with this whole volatile  situation?  </p><p> DHAR:  There's certain things you can control, certain things you can't.   So what we see from an IPO to be strong in the marketplace, good  management, strong growth, strong cash flows -- that's what they can  control from a story standpoint.</p><p> The other stuff, you have to be ready and one of the things that we preach  as we help our clients think through this stuff is you've to be ready.</p><p> An IPO is about a nine to 12-month process to get ready.  And you never  know what's going to happen in a marketplace and when you could actually  dip in into the market place in a favorable moment.  </p><p> BELL:  Can I just ask one question though on IPOs?  81 percent -- I saw a  stat from the University of Florida this year were unprofitable companies.   That rivals 2000 when we were in the dot-com bubble.  So what does that  signal about where we are in the cycle of IPOs or maybe even in the  business cycle.  </p><p> DHAR:  Well, we've seen -- IPOs come in a lot of different flavors.  You  have cash stable companies, a lot of the sponsor backed companies are  actually cash stable companies.  We have seen a big uptick in relation to  get tech and pharma life sciences IPOs. </p><p> And those companies will have that type of profile, strong revenue growth,  but potentially loss-making type of companies.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  At least it doesn't smack of the same type of companies that  were going public back in 2000, companies that just seemed really  ridiculous that barely had a business plan.</p><p> I don't think that -- at least I don't get the same sensation.  </p><p> DHAR:  And there's a lot more diligence in relation to what the investors  are asking for, what companies are being asked on the road shows, the level  of diligence feels different.</p><p> FORBES:  I agree.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Neil it's good to see you.  I've lived through -- thank God I  lived through that.</p><p> Neil Dhar -- Good to see you.  </p><p> DHAR:  Thanks again.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up taking on big technology, our next guest says that  customers and congress need to stand up to some of the biggest companies in  the world.</p><p> Plus, baby shark attack.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The YouTube children's song, now a historical success.  The  story has parents everywhere bopping and shaking their heads.</p><p> We make Steve Forbes sing it, coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Friday, January 11th.  Your top  stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p> The shutdown showdown enters day 21.  Now tied for the longest in U.S.  history.  President Trump considering declaring a national emergency and  using disaster aid to fund the border wall.  </p><p> Futures are heading lower this morning, ever so slight.  Tough to make the  connection between the shutdown and the markets at this point because we've  had a great run.  We've got a 20 point loss on the Dow Futures right now.   The major markets gauges gained about half of one percent yesterday and  they're on track for their longest winning streak since early October, but  really before that massive selloff at the end of the year.  </p><p> In Europe we have some selling to report in England, France and Germany,  although slight, losses of about half of one percent in France and Germany  at the moment.  </p><p> Asia markets, different story, finishing higher overnight, all four there.  </p><p> Recall alert, FiatChrysler warning of a potentially dangerous flaw  impacting 1.6 million vehicles but there's an even bigger issue.  We have  the details.  </p><p> Then addicted to Facebook, we'll tell you about new research that says  using the social media app could be as bad as a cocaine addiction.  </p><p> And shark attack, the hit song baby shark making history.  </p><p> To our top story this half hour, taking on technology.  Companies like  Facebook and Google are bigger than ever.  In fact, the number of Facebook  users now exceeds the populations of China, the United States and Brazil  combined.  Google oversees 90 percent of all online searches.  Between  those two companies, they control roughly two-thirds of all advertising  online.  </p><p> My next guest says there more has to be done to rein these companies in.   She has an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle, consumers, congress: stand  up to tech giants, saying this.  When a small cadre of companies begins to  operate as retailers, news aggregators, advertising platforms and  information keepers, they don't just rise to the top of the marketplace,  they become the marketplace.  Walling off competition in a way that  threatens the very idea of consumer choice.  </p><p> Joining me now, consumer reports president and CEO, Marta Tellado.  Good to  see you Marta this morning.  </p><p> MARTA TELLADO, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, CONSUMER REPORTS:  Great to be here, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you mean by this op-ed?  What should consumers do?  What  should Congress do?  </p><p> TELLADO:  Well, think about it.  Our founders were great believers in the  free market and competition but the thing about free market, you also need  free choice.  How do consumers have free choice when they don't have  knowledge or transparency about what's in the marketplace?  So we need  transparency.  We need accountability.  We also need some changes.  The  physics of this new reality are very different.  </p><p> So, we don't really have the rules and regulations in place to even think  and contemplate how to hold these companies accountable.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  When you say rules and regulations, though, Steve's neck turns  bright red.  But Steve, do you -- what do you have to say to Marta's  editorial?  </p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, in terms of regulations, I  think again, you're going to get national regulations if only because  states are starting to do crazy things.  You don't want to vulcanized  market which would hurt everybody.  So I think it's a preemption.  You will  get something national.  </p><p> But in terms of -- in terms of getting information out there, it's as open  as it's ever been before.  What I want to ask you is, we said the same  thing about IBM, said the same thing about Microsoft, said the same thing  about Walmart, Amazon, now we say about Amazon.  Aren't there things  they're going out there that are going to upend these people like 5G or new  technologies that are going to undo them like they've always done before?  </p><p> TELLADO:  Here's the difference, I think it's yes, we have seen behavior  like this before.  We haven't quite seen so few companies like big tech  that are controlling so much.  As I said in the op-ed, they're not just  tech companies, they are ad platforms.  They are retailers.  They are  controlling our experience.  </p><p> So the dynamic, it's not just what we've seen before.  The physics of this  are entirely different.  It's too few of them and not enough transparency  for consumers to make decisions and --  </p><p> FORBES:  Do you think block chain technology, have you look at that as a  way of getting our privacy back?  </p><p> TELLADO:  People are talking about block chain technology, Bitcoin.  Those  things are thought about, talked about, they're not a reality for everyday  consumers.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about personal choice, Aurora?  I know you want to get in  here.  But again, if consumers just turn their backs on some of these  companies in a way, it's different if you talk about the way that ads are  served online and that's tougher.  But in terms of Facebook, people could  just stop using the platform and really pull back and maybe that would give  rise to alternatives who would be -- with companies that would be more  transparent.  But that just seems like a really long road ahead.  </p><p> TELLADO:  I think you're seeing that already and particularly with young  audiences turning away from Facebook.  But the choices are not there and  the information they need, these companies are not being transparent about  the information they're using.  Consumers are really being victimized by  these incredible technologies that are delighting us but they're also  limiting our choice in terms of pricing, in terms of the whole experience  that we have in our daily lives.  </p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  So Marta, you know, it's a bit of a  double edged sword because I love what you wrote.  But we applaud the  shared services economy because it makes it, one, more efficient for us  all.  Two, actually pricing has gone down, not up in the shared services  economy.  So, in a consumer driven country like ours which is 73 percent  consumer driven to the head of consumer -- to your company, that's a good  thing.  </p><p> TELLADO:  Yes.  </p><p> WOLF:  Now, on the flip side, I agree with you on the regulation side.   Because isn't Facebook and these companies, shouldn't they be regulated no  different than the Wall Street Journal and Fox because really they dominate  advertising, they dominate -- you know, eyeballs.  And I think that's what  you're saying, that there has to be a level playing field for what I would  say is the more mature companies or the older school companies that are  innovating maybe at the same pace, but they don't yet have a oligopoly and  monopoly (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And to that point, Congress could remove the liability waiver  that these social media companies have.  They have a liability waiver for  user generated content because they say they're not media companies.  So,  that is something that Congress could do, but go ahead.  </p><p> TELLADO:  But let me get to something you said, Robert, and that is about  price and quality.  Yes, we're seeing great stuff there.  What we're not  seeing -- we're seeing price and quality.  But what about privacy and  security?  I don't think that things on the books today even come close to  addressing that.  </p><p> WOLF:  Well that's why I'm a supporter of block chain protocol.  I think  it's going to -- I think it's going to proliferate a lot faster than the  marketplace.</p><p> TELLADO:  And we're anxious to see that.  But in -- but in the meantime,  what are the standards by which consumers can go into the marketplace and  make choices about products were in privacy and security and there aren't.   And which is what -- that's caused us to innovate as well.  So what we're  doing is we have developed a whole series of tests and protocols so that  consumers can actually make a choice about which period -- payment app is  going to be the safest for them, and that's exactly what we did.  </p><p> And guess what, as soon as we started testing and creating these standards,  companies started competing against them and saying we want to be number  one, we want to have the best smart T.V. that protects your privacy.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> TELLADO:  So, there are ways to incentivize.  It's not all just regulation.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The problem is that you touch on, is that there is all the power  is in a few hands.  You talk about millennials leaving Facebook.  Well,  they're using Instagram which Facebook owns.  </p><p> TELLADO:  Correct.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I never understood why that was allowed to happen.  Again, these  nerd robber barons who are controlling all of our information and tracking  everything that we do.  </p><p> TELLADO:  Well, I think what all these companies are really excelling at in  addition to delighting us is being consumer trust busters.  I mean,  consumer trust right now is at an all-time low.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Marta, great to see you.  Tellado, did I say it right?  </p><p> TELLADO:  You did indeed.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK, great.  That was very important to me.  Marta, great to see  you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> TELLADO:  Great to be here, thank you so much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here's our highlight reel from this week.  Must see moments from  the show.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president doesn't  want a government shutdown.  He wants the government to open, but he also  wants it to do its job.  </p><p> JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE:  The shutdown is not  good.  But my bigger complaint is that America may be because of bipartisan  politics has been unable to do a lot of things that need to be done.  If  your one of those folks out there, you're a J.P. Morgan Chase client, we're  going to help you.  Call in and we're going to get you some help deferring  payments.  </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  How long can the credit  markets stay this tight before you actually do see it as a worry sign?  </p><p> DIMON:  For a while.  I'm really not worried about it.  I think -- I think  you're just having -- if you look at it the other way around, credit  spreads were abnormally low for a long time.  This is more maybe a little  bit of a normalization.  And you know, you and I both know that the tip of  the ice -- the tip of the spear is IPOs and high yield.  So when people --  when sentiment changes dramatically those are usually the first two areas  where people cut back and then they kind of open up over time.  </p><p> MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR, ALLIANZ:  In 12 months we've gone  from the hope of synchronized pick up in global growth with everybody doing  better to divergence with the U.S. outpacing Europe and China.  And now,  we're worried about the wrong type of convergence.  We're worried about the  U.S. slowing to the rest of the world instead of the rest of the world  picking up towards us.  </p><p> It's for the Fed to realize that it can't be on auto pilot.  That it has to  be more sensitive to what's happening not just in the U.S. economy, but  also to what's happening globally.  </p><p> DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  Not sure Apple  realizes the real issue is that they're trying to sell a Ferrari in the  market that can afford a Ford.  This is why Apple's been losing market  shares.  They actually went from the second largest vendor of phones in the  world, Huawei passed them out of China to become the second largest.  </p><p> KEN FRAZIER, CEO, MERCK:  We want to work with the administration and  Congress, both parties to ensure that patients can have meaningful access  to drugs and affordability is a real problem.  The question is, how do we  solve the affordability problem for today's patients.  We've shown already  that Keytruda as immunotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy can  significantly reduce the amount of deaths.  So, with respect to newly  diagnosed people with the most common form of lung cancer called non  squamous lung cancer we're able to reduce the death rate by 51 percent.   There's never been anything like that.  </p><p> MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL ANALYST:  Started Amazon during  their marriage, dollar for dollar it was amassed during that marriage,  right down the middle, 50 percent generally would go to the spouse.   Anything that he comes out with a statement that can impact the shares of  stock and the value of it can result in a shareholder derivative suit.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Harley Davidson unveiling a new motorcycle later this year.   Joining us right now is Harley Davidson chief marketing officer Heather  Malenshek.</p><p> HEATHER MALENSHEK, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, HARLEY DAVIDSON:  As we think  about -- I mean, electric vehicles they're becoming much more mainstream  but two-wheel mobility -- electric two-wheel mobility is relatively new  trend and we are setting out to lead the electrification of motorcycling.   So, this is all part of our More Roads plan that we launched last year,  which was around broader access to the brands, so opening up new markets  and new channels.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump continues to tweet this morning.  H1B holders,  he's talking about visas.  H1B holders in the United States can rest  assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and  certainty to your stay including a potential path to citizenship.  We want  to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in  the U.S.  That's a biggy -- that is a biggy -- that is --  </p><p> FORBES:  That may lay the basis for resolving this crisis because it gives  something that California H1B visas have been severely restricted.  You  start to throw that out there, along with DACA, you've got a deal.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Steve drops the mic.  FiatChrysler meantime issuing a major  recall over potentially dangerous flaws.  Cheryl Casone has the details  that you need to know, Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, this is interesting,  Dagen.  FiatChrysler recalling more than 1.6 million vehicles worldwide to  replace Takata airbags.  These airbags can explode with too much force and  send shrapnel flying.  The affected models include the 2010 through 2016  Jeep Wrangler and the 2010 Ram pickup.  This is the third recall over  Takata airbags just this week alone.  At the recalls by Toyota and Ford.   And Takata as you know, it's been in the news for years over airbag  troubles.  Chrysler, the stock down 28 percent from one year ago.  </p><p> Well, a new study finding that heavy Facebook users make impaired decisions  like similar to drug addicts basically.  Researchers tested about 70  participants with an exercise.  Psychologist used to measure decision  making.  Based on the people who admitted being excessive Facebook users  did worse on the test than those who didn't use Facebook as often.  Shares  of Facebook are lower in the premarket, down more than half a percent.  </p><p> And then finally, parents of young children, you should be so excited  because the song baby shark has become a smash hit with little kids and now  it is on this week's billboard hot 100.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.  Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.   Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.  Baby shark!</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  This music video has racked up more than 2.1 billion views on  YouTube.  The song has actually been around since 2015.  But it got popular  last week -- last year, excuse me, when a social media challenge asked  listeners to record themselves doing this is the baby shark dance.  So yes,  if you have young kids at home, you thought frozen was bad mom and dad, get  ready for baby shark, I know.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's Steve, baby shark doo doo doo doo doo doo.  Steve's doing  it.  I'm going to be doing that all day long.  </p><p> FORBES:  We've got two young grandchildren, three and-a-half and one and-a- half, and the only way they eat food is you have that device in front of  them playing baby shark.  We sing along with them.  They eat the food.   It's great.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was helpful hints from grandfather Steve Forbes.  </p><p> FORBES:  Meet all needs here.  Markets, parenting, babies.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, we address -- we address everyone's needs, absolutely.  </p><p> Coming up, healthy food for man's best friend.  We talk to one company that  wants your dog eating as well as you, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Delicious, delectable, high end dog food, a new personalized pet  meal start-up called The Farmer's Dog boasts that meals are made -- freshly  made and healthy even humans can eat them and they're delivered to your  door.  </p><p> Joining me now, the co-founders of The Farmer's Dog Brett Podolsky and  Jonathan Regev.  Jonathan and good to see you both.  And Brett, to you  first.</p><p> BRETT PODOLSKY, CO-FOUNDER, THE FARMER'S DOG:  Sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, I'm going to hold up this delicious bowl of -- it looks like  tuna and corn, and broccoli and squash and carrots.  So this is not just  for people but for your dog.  </p><p> JONATHAN REGEV, CO-FOUNDER, THE FARMER'S DOG:  Yes, it's for your dog.   It's actually turkey.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turkey.  It looks delicious.  But how did you guys come up with  the idea for the -- for the company?  </p><p> PODOLSKY:  Well, it all started with my dog, Jada.  She was sick for the  first two years that I had her.  I was desperate to find the solution for  her.  And after trying every pet food and going to several vets, finally a  vet recommended that I tried home cooking for her and it was like magic,  all of her symptoms disappeared.  </p><p> And it made me wonder what was going on with pet food because I used -- the  vet recommended that I use the exact same ingredients that were on the pet  food label that I had been feeding her.  But when I cooked it, the result  was very different.  It wasn't brown balls, it looked like actual food.   And her stomach symptoms were cured.  </p><p> So, I wanted something better for her.  And after doing a lot of research  into the pet industry and for anybody that has done any research into how  they make pet food, it's pretty alarming.  So, I wanted something better  for her.  And after realizing there was just no companies out there that I  felt comfortable feeding her, we decided to build that company.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, how did you build the company, Jonathan?  How did you --  how are you getting this message out to consumers who might just be  ordering their dog food from Amazon?  </p><p> REGEV:  Sure, yes.  So, at first, we really didn't focus on marketing.  It  was really difficult and complicated to create the supply chain needed.   And also, the technology to create a subscription to have food look like  this.  </p><p> Because remember, this food in particular, it's not meant to look pretty.   And it's not meant to look fancy.  It's just -- you know, fresh food.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, it does look fresh -- it does look fresh.  </p><p> REGEV:  And it is fresh.  And so that -- to do that in an affordable way  and also to make the food very convenient to feed, that was where the  difficulty was.  So, we really didn't focus on marketing for the first  three years or so.  It really grew by word of mouth.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, how are you selling it?  Brett, how is -- how are -- is the  dog food sold essentially?  Like, do you advertise on podcasts?  It's  direct to consumer?  Are you in stores at all?  </p><p> REGEV:  Yes, so we're just -- we're just starting to now.  So, it's online  only and it's direct to consumer.  Because direct to consumer is the really  -- the only way that we could keep the food fresh and convenient.  </p><p> So, basically how that works is you go online, you enter your dog's  information.  And we take all of that into account.  We create a custom  plan for them and then that feeds back into our very complicated supply  chain that can then deliver the food fresh.  So food actually comes in this  package, right, so it's personalized for your dog.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can hand it to me.  </p><p> REGEV:  Sure.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thanks.  </p><p> REGEV:  So, it's pre-portioned for your dog.  Your dog's name will be on  it.  And that's -- thank you, you're very good.  And that's mainly so we  know exactly how much you have at any given time, right?  And so, before  you run out, our kitchens are making food.  </p><p> FORBES:  (INAUDIBLE) Starbucks for dogs.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.  </p><p> FORBES:  Bring your dog and you get high end foods at Starbucks.  </p><p> REGEV:  Dogs should be allowed at any cafe.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I agree.  And you're welcome back on that note, Jonathan and  Brett.</p><p> REGEV:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Please come back both of you.  </p><p> REGEV:  Appreciate it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back, everybody.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> END</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dagen  McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Friday, January 11th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The shutdown entering day 21.  Tied for the longest in U.S. history.   President Trump now considering declaring a national emergency and using  disaster aid money to fund the border wall.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My sacred duty, most sacred  duty as president is to defend the people of our nation.  That's whether  it's from foreign nations or along the border.  It's all defending our  people.  And defending them properly and strongly and really rightly,  justly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meantime futures are showing this this morning.  29 point loss,  30 point loss on the DOW futures.  Investors are waiting for some headway,  like some evidence that a trade deal is coming together with China,  although optimistic about the progress so far.</p><p>Yesterday all three of the major market gauges gained about half of 1  percent, markets on their longest winning streak since early October.</p><p>In Europe, we have some losses to report across the board, in England,  France and Germany, although slight there.</p><p>And your Asian markets -- all four major Asian markets finishing higher  overnight.</p><p>Oil heading to the plus side this morning.  The price of crude oil on its  longest upward swing since January of 2010. </p><p>Plus, Hail Mary, details on Apple's plan for a new phone that the company  hopes will pull it out of that iPhone sales slump.</p><p>And shark attack, the hit song, \"Baby Shark\", makes history.  We will bury  it in your head and you will not be able to get rid of it.</p><p>Here with me to break it all down -- CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell; Forbes Media chairman and former Republican presidential candidate,  Steve Forbes; and Fox News contributor, 32Advisors founder and CEO, former  economic advisor to President Obama -- Robert Wolf.  Welcome one and all.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:   Great first hour.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're such a flatterer.  </p><p>WOLF:  Great first hour.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because you're here and you're here and you're here.</p><p>Somebody already called me a nasty name on Twitter.  But I'll take that.   That's fine.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN:  Just think of that shark song.  It  works with three-year-olds and one-year-olds.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you know the song -- Steve?  </p><p>FORBES:  I'm not going to hurt your ratings by citing it but my three-year- old can cite it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just love that -- deeply and profoundly.  So we'll get to that  later this hour.</p><p>But right now our top story -- weighing a national emergency, White House  aides exploring new options to fund a southern border wall as lawmakers  remain at a standstill over any deal.  The White House directing the Army  Corps of Engineers to divert money from other areas like disaster relief  projects to secure funding if necessary.</p><p>President Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News that a border wall is the  only solution.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  It's common sense.  It really is, when you think of it, whether  you're into the world of law enforcement like these incredible folks behind  us (AUDIO GAP) so easily.  I mean it would make their job so much better.   And they could also go to other areas because we have the wall, you don't  need so many people.  We would probably pay for that many times in one  year.</p><p>The law is very clear.  I mean we have the absolute right to declare a  national emergency.  And this is security stuff.  This is a national  emergency.</p><p>If you don't have a barrier, whether it's a steel barrier or a concrete  wall, substantial and strong, you are never going to solve this problem.   You're never going to solve it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now Fox News contributor, former speaker of the house  and author of \"Trump's America\", Newt Gingrich.</p><p>Mr. Speaker -- it's always a pleasure to see you.  I am dying to hear what  you have to say about this.  What do you say about the President  potentially using emergency authority to get this wall built?  </p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I mean if the lawyers tell him  that it will withstand a court challenge, he has every right to do it.   He's commander in chief and the Congress has allocated money for the  defense of the United States.</p><p>But I do think that there's a certain value to him fighting this out.   Every day that goes by, it's more obvious that the Democrats don't value  the safety of Americans nearly as much as they value the convenience of  people trying to get here illegally.  </p><p>And every day that goes by I think the fact that the Democrats won't  compromise, you know, Nancy Pelosi saying if you give me everything I want,  I still won't give you the wall.  I think that attitude is a really bad way  for them to start with a new Congress.</p><p>And so I think in many ways this is a key moment for the President in  defining what's at stake for the country and in shaping the next two years.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will the Republicans continue to stand with him?  That's what --  in terms of will their knees buckle or do they have -- do they have the  guts -- </p><p>GINGRICH:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- to stand with him?</p><p>GINGRICH:  It doesn't matter.  If he's prepared to veto a bill, he's  certainly going to keep one-third plus one of the Senate and one-third plus  one of the House, so he'll sustain any veto he wants.  If some Republicans  at the margin want to be timid, they want to be panicked, they want to run  in circles, you know, the way our constitutional system works, a president  who is tough and determined has enormous advantages.</p><p>And I think that he in many ways can relax and just say -- you know, first  of all, Senator McConnell said he won't bring up a bill the President won't  sign.  So it's not going to go through the Senate.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi can -- you know, she can perform a ballet act, she can dance  in circles, she can jump up and down, she would have gymnast -- it won't  matter.  It's not going to change anything.  She can't force it through.  </p><p>FORBES:  Mr. Speaker, sounds like you don't think the President should  declare a national emergency but simply let the thing play out.  Is that  what you're saying?  You'd advise him not to do that?  He's winning  already, why mess it up?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well look, I think if you got -- I mean first of all, I think  what he said all along is the right position.  He is not going to sign this  appropriation unless they solve -- </p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>FORBES:  But you don't think he should do the national emergency?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  -- commit themselves to solving it.</p><p>FORBES:  You're saying he can't but you don't think he should?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  I think that it is less powerful than winning this fight.  He's  got to decide what he wants to do.  But I always tell people, when you  start thinking about any kind of campaign -- military, political -- you  always have to say then what.  Ok?</p><p>Tomorrow morning he declares a national emergency.  It goes to court  immediately.  But nonetheless, we're moving in the right direction.  He  can't really declare victory over the Congress.  I mean at that point what  he's done is had a clever detour to get around the congress and that's not  going to solve the long-term problem. </p><p>The long-term problem is Nancy Pelosi who has a crazy wing of her party  now, a wing which is totally out of touch with reality.  Nancy Pelosi right  now thinks that she is the equal to the President.</p><p>I went through this.  And we won and ultimately got a very important  agreement with President Clinton because we had a principled positive goal.   Nancy Pelosi's goal is purely negative.  </p><p>Our goal was to get to a balanced budget which as you know, Steve, we were  the only people in your lifetime to produce four consecutive balanced  budgets.  And that came out of having what was tied today as the longest  shutdown in history.  You don't do these things lightly.  </p><p>FORBES:  -- which just quickly, Mr. Speaker, gets to another thing.  The  Democrats are talking about a 70 percent tax rate and all that kind of  thing.  When are the Republicans going to put something exciting on the  table and go on offense, like a flat tax, put something exciting out there  for the American people instead of letting the Democrats dominate the  agenda on taxes?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well, I hope they'll do it pretty quickly.  Although I must say,  if you want to think about a suicidal party, being the party that runs next  year vote for me and I'll raise your taxes to 70 percent, I don't see how a  New Yorker survives that.  I hope every successful person in New York is  looking at what the left wing of the party wants to do to them.</p><p>Because as you know, when you combine state, city and federal taxes, a 70  percent rate just would be a killer.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the congresswoman who threw that idea out there, how many  days had she been an actual member of Congress.  And they put her on \"60  Minutes\" for Pete's sake but that's another problem.</p><p>The government shutdown reaching day 21, Newt -- Mr. Speaker -- which in  day 21, that ties the '95, '96 government shutdown under the Clinton  administration.  You remember this well.  You were speaker -- you were just  talking about it.  You were speaker during the shutdown.</p><p>It was -- if you look back, though, do you have any regrets about what  happened back then?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  No.  And I think the Washington establishment is just totally  wrong about this.  We were the first Republican congress in 40 years.  We  had a position we believed in deeply.  We were prepared to fight over it.   The reward was in 1996 we became the first Republican House reelected since  1928.</p><p>I mean all these so-called Washington smart people go around and say boy,  that really hurt the Republicans.  We're the first people that got  reelected in 68 years.  And it's because our base believed that we're real,  that we were committed to welfare reform.  We're committed to the largest  capital gains tax cut in history.  We're committed to balancing the budget.</p><p>The President has the same thing going for him.  I mean he has communicated  he's a man of strength.  He's a man of determination.  He is committed to  protecting Americans and I think every day that this goes on, the Democrats  are in danger of looking like a party that doesn't care about American  lives, doesn't care about American families, and is frankly the party of  illegal immigration rather than protecting Americans.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get your reaction to Senator Kamala Harris who  dismissed President Trump's border wall fight when she was on the late show  with Stephen Colbert.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  We have hundreds of thousands of  Americans who are not going to get paid and they're not getting paid  because the President of the United States has a vanity project that he  doesn't want to give up.  And it is outrageous.  It is irresponsible.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Vanity project, Mr. Speaker.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Look, Kamala Harris represents what I think of as California  crazy.  I mean California's a state and the governor in California just  said we're not only going to be a sanctuary state, we're going to have free  healthcare for everybody and the governor of California, the new governor  said and \"I specifically mean illegal immigrants\".</p><p>So he's sending a signal to the entire planet, if you can get to  California, we'll take care of your health problems for free.</p><p>That is the kind of policies -- the former mayor of San Francisco, a city  which now has people in hazmat suits paid $200,000 a year to walk around  all day and pick up human feces off the street because there are so many  homeless people in San Francisco which is by the way the largest center of  capital in the world in the last 25 or 30 years.</p><p>So you have a state which is nuts.  You have a senator who has no clue.   And you have a governor who is saying basically I'd like to have open  borders, be a sanctuary state and everybody who gets here, I will give them  a taxpayers cost-free healthcare which, of course, will destroy the  California health system.</p><p>I mean I just think there's a certain amount of craziness going on in  California and Kamala Harris is just part of it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So I'm putting you down as a no, you're not moving to  California.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  I love California as a state.  I just think its politicians have  gone crazy.  The state's wonderful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  the people are lovely.  The state is beautiful.  But it's a  whole lot of crazy.  Mr. Speaker -- thank you so much.  Newt Gingrich --  great insight.</p><p>GINGRICH: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to bring you this.  President Trump's tweet on the  wall of the border, \"I often said during rallies with little variation that  Mexico will pay for the wall.  We have just signed a great new trade deal  with Mexico.  It is billions of dollars a year.  Better than the very bad  NAFTA deal which it replaces.  The difference pays for the wall many times  over.</p><p>There's an issue there, though.  That has to get ratified by Congress.   Nancy Pelosi, now the new speaker, has to take it up.  Will she just put it  in her drawer and say bye-bye? </p><p>It's another worry for the markets that we haven't even talked about but we  will as the show moves on.</p><p>Coming up, Apple rolling out new gear -- the tech giant unveiling three new  iPhone models this year despite slumping sales.  That story.</p><p>Plus parents of young children know this song well, \"Baby Shark\" swims into  the history books.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  U.S. troops have begun withdrawing from Syria.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hey -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey -- Dagen.  Yes.</p><p>A U.S. Defense official has now confirmed to Fox News that those troops are  being withdrawn on President Trump's orders to pull out of the country.   Military officials aren't sharing an exact time line or locations of the  troops, of course, for their safety.  But the full withdrawal that  President Trump is calling for overall may be a bit delayed.</p><p>U.S. National security advisor John Bolton said earlier this week that  troops won't be pulled out until ISIS is completely defeated and Kurdish  fighters are guaranteed protection from Turkey.</p><p>Well, more trouble for Huawei.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" says an executive  for the Chinese telecom company has been arrested in Poland and charged  with espionage.  The suspect is Huawei's local sales director who is a  Chinese national.  The former deputy head of Poland's IT Security  Department also is in custody, we should add.  This latest arrests coming  amid concerns by the U.S. and other western governments that Beijing is  using Huawei, the company, to spy on those countries.</p><p>Well, Apple reportedly is planning to introduce three new LCD iPhones this  fall, despite the struggling 10R sales.  And yes, I said iPhones.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that Apple is going to unveil new  camera features including a triple rear camera for the highest end model.   Apple is sticking with LCD this year.  But it's considering dropping its  LCD models next year.</p><p>AlphaOne Capital Partners' founding partner Dan Niles was on MORNINGS WITH  MARIA earlier this week.  He said Apple is focusing on the wrong products.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  5G is a really big deal.  If  5G is on the horizon and I know that want to get the latest, greatest on my  phone, but an iPhone is not compatible to 5G, why would I buy an iPhone?  </p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL:  That's a really good point.   And so I think when you think about 2019, 5G is going to roll out -- it's  going to start rolling out to their carriers in the June quarter.</p><p>Well, Apple doesn't have a 5G phone out.  So if you're trying to convince  somebody hey, you want to spend $1,000.  Well, does it have 5G?  Well no.   So then they'll wait.</p><p>So I think this year could actually be worse than last year in terms of how  much the smartphone market shrinks.  Apple not having 5G is an even bigger  problem.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: All right.  Let's take a look at shares of Apple in the premarket,  unchanged right now -- Dagen.  And you know, you've also led some great  discussions this week on Apple -- Dagen, in particular, how many $1,000  phones do consumers need?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  And Apple is upping the amount of money that you get  on a trade-in, trying to get people to -- to get people into these phones.</p><p>Thank you so much -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey -- I want to get your reaction to something because it's  not just Apple.  And we're going to talk about it later in the show but the  retail.  Macy's stock had its worst one day performance ever I think  yesterday on weak sales.  So again, that was hard on the markets, hard on  that sector, for sure.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  For sure.  And you know what, I  think what surprised me the most is that the conversation yesterday was  about the consumer being dense (ph).  Not about what was really plaguing  retail at the end of third quarter earnings was what about trade and how is  that going to impact the cost of goods and things, apparel and things that  they're selling.</p><p>I think that this is going to be -- still be a very good holiday sales  season, like the Mastercard numbers you got as well as some of the other  data we're seeing in retail sales is going to show that there are winners  and losers within the retail space.  And I think Amazon and Walmart are  going to be some of the biggest winners.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Elle Brands which is the owner of Victoria's secret also  was down about 5 percent yesterday -- tepid holiday sales.  This is a front  page story in the \"Wall Street Journal\" which we warned you about because  again, women are not buying that garbage that is like some standard of  beauty that nobody is not related to anybody's life anymore.  And they keep  just pushing ahead with this thing from the early '90s.  </p><p>You've got be innovative, you've got to be doing e-commerce right.  That's  where you're going to win.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  And I will get your response to Speaker  Gingrich.  I want to know because -- </p><p>WOLF:  I'm going to wait until we have him back on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you can't.  I'm going to make you talk about it.  </p><p>Coming up, markets on a winning streak -- we're looking at stocks and how  the government shutdown is impacting the IPO market in the New Year.</p><p>And social media's impact, one study finding heavy Facebook use could be  impairing your decision making.  Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The government shutdown now tied for the longest in the nation's  history.  Tomorrow it will be the longest if it lasts.  And it could delay  IPOs in 2019 in the New Year.</p><p>Joining us now, PWC partner, head of financial services Neil Dhar.  Neal --  great of you to be here.</p><p>NEIL DHAR, PWC PARTNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's the impact right now?</p><p>DHAR:  Right now it's very difficult to get an IPO out in the marketplace  because you need a regulator to sort of sign off on the document.  There is  no regulator at the moment other than emergency things.  So what we're  seeing is December had a lot of volatility in the marketplace.  So it was  very slow from an IPO standpoint.</p><p>And now, we're not going to see many things, basically what happens in  January is if you don't get IPOs out immediately, then folks will wait for  year-end earnings.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So isn't this is a blessing for these companies, though, in some  way?  Because it gives them cover.  Kathleen smith, who researches wait for  year-end earnings.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So isn't this is a blessing for these companies, though, in some  way?  Because it gives them cover.  Because Kathleen Smith, who researches  IPOs, was on this program and she thought the market was so rotten at the  end of the year that it could be closed for IPOs at least in the first  quarter so it gives them a little bit of cover to take some time and wait  for the market to recover.  Do you agree with that?  </p><p>DHAR:  Well, I think 2018 was a very good year for IPOs.  There was about  215 IPOs which is actually a very good year.  Usually anything over 200 we  believe is a strong year.</p><p>So we have that momentum.  You're right, things did slow down at the back  end of the year.  Volatility is usually a very big pain point in the unless  you get into </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was really talking about the performance in the second half  of the year, the companies that did go public.  </p><p>DHAR:  We did see that.  We did see a drop in relation to the IPOs that  went out at the beginning of the year, traded up versus the one that's came  out at the back end.  </p><p>FORBES:  And Neil -- I think what you said, volatility is the key point.   We have volatility with the government shutdown, with geopolitical risk,  with trade, with tax 1.0 versus 2.0, with fiscal, with fed.  And a company  -- we can live on good and/or bad news.  But what we struggle with is when  we have no idea what the future may be -- </p><p>DHAR:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  -- which is why this government shutdown.  The idea that we have  regulators not able to work.  We have the FDA not able to work.  These  impact all companies, whether it's going into earnings season or it's going  into IPO season or it's going into retail sales.  You know, are we going to  get the right numbers?</p><p>So what do you tell your customers how to deal with this whole volatile  situation?  </p><p>DHAR:  There's certain things you can control, certain things you can't.   So what we see from an IPO to be strong in the marketplace, good  management, strong growth, strong cash flows -- that's what they can  control from a story standpoint.</p><p>The other stuff, you have to be ready and one of the things that we preach  as we help our clients think through this stuff is you've to be ready.</p><p>An IPO is about a nine to 12-month process to get ready.  And you never  know what's going to happen in a marketplace and when you could actually  dip in into the market place in a favorable moment.  </p><p>BELL:  Can I just ask one question though on IPOs?  81 percent -- I saw a  stat from the University of Florida this year were unprofitable companies.   That rivals 2000 when we were in the dot-com bubble.  So what does that  signal about where we are in the cycle of IPOs or maybe even in the  business cycle.  </p><p>DHAR:  Well, we've seen -- IPOs come in a lot of different flavors.  You  have cash stable companies, a lot of the sponsor backed companies are  actually cash stable companies.  We have seen a big uptick in relation to  get tech and pharma life sciences IPOs. </p><p>And those companies will have that type of profile, strong revenue growth,  but potentially loss-making type of companies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At least it doesn't smack of the same type of companies that  were going public back in 2000, companies that just seemed really  ridiculous that barely had a business plan.</p><p>I don't think that -- at least I don't get the same sensation.  </p><p>DHAR:  And there's a lot more diligence in relation to what the investors  are asking for, what companies are being asked on the road shows, the level  of diligence feels different.</p><p>FORBES:  I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Neil it's good to see you.  I've lived through -- thank God I  lived through that.</p><p>Neil Dhar -- Good to see you.  </p><p>DHAR:  Thanks again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up taking on big technology, our next guest says that  customers and congress need to stand up to some of the biggest companies in  the world.</p><p>Plus, baby shark attack.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The YouTube children's song, now a historical success.  The  story has parents everywhere bopping and shaking their heads.</p><p>We make Steve Forbes sing it, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Friday, January 11th.  Your top  stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p>The shutdown showdown enters day 21.  Now tied for the longest in U.S.  history.  President Trump considering declaring a national emergency and  using disaster aid to fund the border wall.  </p><p>Futures are heading lower this morning, ever so slight.  Tough to make the  connection between the shutdown and the markets at this point because we've  had a great run.  We've got a 20 point loss on the Dow Futures right now.   The major markets gauges gained about half of one percent yesterday and  they're on track for their longest winning streak since early October, but  really before that massive selloff at the end of the year.  </p><p>In Europe we have some selling to report in England, France and Germany,  although slight, losses of about half of one percent in France and Germany  at the moment.  </p><p>Asia markets, different story, finishing higher overnight, all four there.  </p><p>Recall alert, FiatChrysler warning of a potentially dangerous flaw  impacting 1.6 million vehicles but there's an even bigger issue.  We have  the details.  </p><p>Then addicted to Facebook, we'll tell you about new research that says  using the social media app could be as bad as a cocaine addiction.  </p><p>And shark attack, the hit song baby shark making history.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, taking on technology.  Companies like  Facebook and Google are bigger than ever.  In fact, the number of Facebook  users now exceeds the populations of China, the United States and Brazil  combined.  Google oversees 90 percent of all online searches.  Between  those two companies, they control roughly two-thirds of all advertising  online.  </p><p>My next guest says there more has to be done to rein these companies in.   She has an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle, consumers, congress: stand  up to tech giants, saying this.  When a small cadre of companies begins to  operate as retailers, news aggregators, advertising platforms and  information keepers, they don't just rise to the top of the marketplace,  they become the marketplace.  Walling off competition in a way that  threatens the very idea of consumer choice.  </p><p>Joining me now, consumer reports president and CEO, Marta Tellado.  Good to  see you Marta this morning.  </p><p>MARTA TELLADO, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, CONSUMER REPORTS:  Great to be here, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you mean by this op-ed?  What should consumers do?  What  should Congress do?  </p><p>TELLADO:  Well, think about it.  Our founders were great believers in the  free market and competition but the thing about free market, you also need  free choice.  How do consumers have free choice when they don't have  knowledge or transparency about what's in the marketplace?  So we need  transparency.  We need accountability.  We also need some changes.  The  physics of this new reality are very different.  </p><p>So, we don't really have the rules and regulations in place to even think  and contemplate how to hold these companies accountable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you say rules and regulations, though, Steve's neck turns  bright red.  But Steve, do you -- what do you have to say to Marta's  editorial?  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, in terms of regulations, I  think again, you're going to get national regulations if only because  states are starting to do crazy things.  You don't want to vulcanized  market which would hurt everybody.  So I think it's a preemption.  You will  get something national.  </p><p>But in terms of -- in terms of getting information out there, it's as open  as it's ever been before.  What I want to ask you is, we said the same  thing about IBM, said the same thing about Microsoft, said the same thing  about Walmart, Amazon, now we say about Amazon.  Aren't there things  they're going out there that are going to upend these people like 5G or new  technologies that are going to undo them like they've always done before?  </p><p>TELLADO:  Here's the difference, I think it's yes, we have seen behavior  like this before.  We haven't quite seen so few companies like big tech  that are controlling so much.  As I said in the op-ed, they're not just  tech companies, they are ad platforms.  They are retailers.  They are  controlling our experience.  </p><p>So the dynamic, it's not just what we've seen before.  The physics of this  are entirely different.  It's too few of them and not enough transparency  for consumers to make decisions and --  </p><p>FORBES:  Do you think block chain technology, have you look at that as a  way of getting our privacy back?  </p><p>TELLADO:  People are talking about block chain technology, Bitcoin.  Those  things are thought about, talked about, they're not a reality for everyday  consumers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about personal choice, Aurora?  I know you want to get in  here.  But again, if consumers just turn their backs on some of these  companies in a way, it's different if you talk about the way that ads are  served online and that's tougher.  But in terms of Facebook, people could  just stop using the platform and really pull back and maybe that would give  rise to alternatives who would be -- with companies that would be more  transparent.  But that just seems like a really long road ahead.  </p><p>TELLADO:  I think you're seeing that already and particularly with young  audiences turning away from Facebook.  But the choices are not there and  the information they need, these companies are not being transparent about  the information they're using.  Consumers are really being victimized by  these incredible technologies that are delighting us but they're also  limiting our choice in terms of pricing, in terms of the whole experience  that we have in our daily lives.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  So Marta, you know, it's a bit of a  double edged sword because I love what you wrote.  But we applaud the  shared services economy because it makes it, one, more efficient for us  all.  Two, actually pricing has gone down, not up in the shared services  economy.  So, in a consumer driven country like ours which is 73 percent  consumer driven to the head of consumer -- to your company, that's a good  thing.  </p><p>TELLADO:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  Now, on the flip side, I agree with you on the regulation side.   Because isn't Facebook and these companies, shouldn't they be regulated no  different than the Wall Street Journal and Fox because really they dominate  advertising, they dominate -- you know, eyeballs.  And I think that's what  you're saying, that there has to be a level playing field for what I would  say is the more mature companies or the older school companies that are  innovating maybe at the same pace, but they don't yet have a oligopoly and  monopoly (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And to that point, Congress could remove the liability waiver  that these social media companies have.  They have a liability waiver for  user generated content because they say they're not media companies.  So,  that is something that Congress could do, but go ahead.  </p><p>TELLADO:  But let me get to something you said, Robert, and that is about  price and quality.  Yes, we're seeing great stuff there.  What we're not  seeing -- we're seeing price and quality.  But what about privacy and  security?  I don't think that things on the books today even come close to  addressing that.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well that's why I'm a supporter of block chain protocol.  I think  it's going to -- I think it's going to proliferate a lot faster than the  marketplace.</p><p>TELLADO:  And we're anxious to see that.  But in -- but in the meantime,  what are the standards by which consumers can go into the marketplace and  make choices about products were in privacy and security and there aren't.   And which is what -- that's caused us to innovate as well.  So what we're  doing is we have developed a whole series of tests and protocols so that  consumers can actually make a choice about which period -- payment app is  going to be the safest for them, and that's exactly what we did.  </p><p>And guess what, as soon as we started testing and creating these standards,  companies started competing against them and saying we want to be number  one, we want to have the best smart T.V. that protects your privacy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>TELLADO:  So, there are ways to incentivize.  It's not all just regulation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The problem is that you touch on, is that there is all the power  is in a few hands.  You talk about millennials leaving Facebook.  Well,  they're using Instagram which Facebook owns.  </p><p>TELLADO:  Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I never understood why that was allowed to happen.  Again, these  nerd robber barons who are controlling all of our information and tracking  everything that we do.  </p><p>TELLADO:  Well, I think what all these companies are really excelling at in  addition to delighting us is being consumer trust busters.  I mean,  consumer trust right now is at an all-time low.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Marta, great to see you.  Tellado, did I say it right?  </p><p>TELLADO:  You did indeed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK, great.  That was very important to me.  Marta, great to see  you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>TELLADO:  Great to be here, thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's our highlight reel from this week.  Must see moments from  the show.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president doesn't  want a government shutdown.  He wants the government to open, but he also  wants it to do its job.  </p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE:  The shutdown is not  good.  But my bigger complaint is that America may be because of bipartisan  politics has been unable to do a lot of things that need to be done.  If  your one of those folks out there, you're a J.P. Morgan Chase client, we're  going to help you.  Call in and we're going to get you some help deferring  payments.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  How long can the credit  markets stay this tight before you actually do see it as a worry sign?  </p><p>DIMON:  For a while.  I'm really not worried about it.  I think -- I think  you're just having -- if you look at it the other way around, credit  spreads were abnormally low for a long time.  This is more maybe a little  bit of a normalization.  And you know, you and I both know that the tip of  the ice -- the tip of the spear is IPOs and high yield.  So when people --  when sentiment changes dramatically those are usually the first two areas  where people cut back and then they kind of open up over time.  </p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR, ALLIANZ:  In 12 months we've gone  from the hope of synchronized pick up in global growth with everybody doing  better to divergence with the U.S. outpacing Europe and China.  And now,  we're worried about the wrong type of convergence.  We're worried about the  U.S. slowing to the rest of the world instead of the rest of the world  picking up towards us.  </p><p>It's for the Fed to realize that it can't be on auto pilot.  That it has to  be more sensitive to what's happening not just in the U.S. economy, but  also to what's happening globally.  </p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  Not sure Apple  realizes the real issue is that they're trying to sell a Ferrari in the  market that can afford a Ford.  This is why Apple's been losing market  shares.  They actually went from the second largest vendor of phones in the  world, Huawei passed them out of China to become the second largest.  </p><p>KEN FRAZIER, CEO, MERCK:  We want to work with the administration and  Congress, both parties to ensure that patients can have meaningful access  to drugs and affordability is a real problem.  The question is, how do we  solve the affordability problem for today's patients.  We've shown already  that Keytruda as immunotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy can  significantly reduce the amount of deaths.  So, with respect to newly  diagnosed people with the most common form of lung cancer called non  squamous lung cancer we're able to reduce the death rate by 51 percent.   There's never been anything like that.  </p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL ANALYST:  Started Amazon during  their marriage, dollar for dollar it was amassed during that marriage,  right down the middle, 50 percent generally would go to the spouse.   Anything that he comes out with a statement that can impact the shares of  stock and the value of it can result in a shareholder derivative suit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Harley Davidson unveiling a new motorcycle later this year.   Joining us right now is Harley Davidson chief marketing officer Heather  Malenshek.</p><p>HEATHER MALENSHEK, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, HARLEY DAVIDSON:  As we think  about -- I mean, electric vehicles they're becoming much more mainstream  but two-wheel mobility -- electric two-wheel mobility is relatively new  trend and we are setting out to lead the electrification of motorcycling.   So, this is all part of our More Roads plan that we launched last year,  which was around broader access to the brands, so opening up new markets  and new channels.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump continues to tweet this morning.  H1B holders,  he's talking about visas.  H1B holders in the United States can rest  assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and  certainty to your stay including a potential path to citizenship.  We want  to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in  the U.S.  That's a biggy -- that is a biggy -- that is --  </p><p>FORBES:  That may lay the basis for resolving this crisis because it gives  something that California H1B visas have been severely restricted.  You  start to throw that out there, along with DACA, you've got a deal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Steve drops the mic.  FiatChrysler meantime issuing a major  recall over potentially dangerous flaws.  Cheryl Casone has the details  that you need to know, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, this is interesting,  Dagen.  FiatChrysler recalling more than 1.6 million vehicles worldwide to  replace Takata airbags.  These airbags can explode with too much force and  send shrapnel flying.  The affected models include the 2010 through 2016  Jeep Wrangler and the 2010 Ram pickup.  This is the third recall over  Takata airbags just this week alone.  At the recalls by Toyota and Ford.   And Takata as you know, it's been in the news for years over airbag  troubles.  Chrysler, the stock down 28 percent from one year ago.  </p><p>Well, a new study finding that heavy Facebook users make impaired decisions  like similar to drug addicts basically.  Researchers tested about 70  participants with an exercise.  Psychologist used to measure decision  making.  Based on the people who admitted being excessive Facebook users  did worse on the test than those who didn't use Facebook as often.  Shares  of Facebook are lower in the premarket, down more than half a percent.  </p><p>And then finally, parents of young children, you should be so excited  because the song baby shark has become a smash hit with little kids and now  it is on this week's billboard hot 100.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.  Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.   Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.  Baby shark!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  This music video has racked up more than 2.1 billion views on  YouTube.  The song has actually been around since 2015.  But it got popular  last week -- last year, excuse me, when a social media challenge asked  listeners to record themselves doing this is the baby shark dance.  So yes,  if you have young kids at home, you thought frozen was bad mom and dad, get  ready for baby shark, I know.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's Steve, baby shark doo doo doo doo doo doo.  Steve's doing  it.  I'm going to be doing that all day long.  </p><p>FORBES:  We've got two young grandchildren, three and-a-half and one and-a- half, and the only way they eat food is you have that device in front of  them playing baby shark.  We sing along with them.  They eat the food.   It's great.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was helpful hints from grandfather Steve Forbes.  </p><p>FORBES:  Meet all needs here.  Markets, parenting, babies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we address -- we address everyone's needs, absolutely.  </p><p>Coming up, healthy food for man's best friend.  We talk to one company that  wants your dog eating as well as you, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Delicious, delectable, high end dog food, a new personalized pet  meal start-up called The Farmer's Dog boasts that meals are made -- freshly  made and healthy even humans can eat them and they're delivered to your  door.  </p><p>Joining me now, the co-founders of The Farmer's Dog Brett Podolsky and  Jonathan Regev.  Jonathan and good to see you both.  And Brett, to you  first.</p><p>BRETT PODOLSKY, CO-FOUNDER, THE FARMER'S DOG:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, I'm going to hold up this delicious bowl of -- it looks like  tuna and corn, and broccoli and squash and carrots.  So this is not just  for people but for your dog.  </p><p>JONATHAN REGEV, CO-FOUNDER, THE FARMER'S DOG:  Yes, it's for your dog.   It's actually turkey.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turkey.  It looks delicious.  But how did you guys come up with  the idea for the -- for the company?  </p><p>PODOLSKY:  Well, it all started with my dog, Jada.  She was sick for the  first two years that I had her.  I was desperate to find the solution for  her.  And after trying every pet food and going to several vets, finally a  vet recommended that I tried home cooking for her and it was like magic,  all of her symptoms disappeared.  </p><p>And it made me wonder what was going on with pet food because I used -- the  vet recommended that I use the exact same ingredients that were on the pet  food label that I had been feeding her.  But when I cooked it, the result  was very different.  It wasn't brown balls, it looked like actual food.   And her stomach symptoms were cured.  </p><p>So, I wanted something better for her.  And after doing a lot of research  into the pet industry and for anybody that has done any research into how  they make pet food, it's pretty alarming.  So, I wanted something better  for her.  And after realizing there was just no companies out there that I  felt comfortable feeding her, we decided to build that company.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, how did you build the company, Jonathan?  How did you --  how are you getting this message out to consumers who might just be  ordering their dog food from Amazon?  </p><p>REGEV:  Sure, yes.  So, at first, we really didn't focus on marketing.  It  was really difficult and complicated to create the supply chain needed.   And also, the technology to create a subscription to have food look like  this.  </p><p>Because remember, this food in particular, it's not meant to look pretty.   And it's not meant to look fancy.  It's just -- you know, fresh food.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it does look fresh -- it does look fresh.  </p><p>REGEV:  And it is fresh.  And so that -- to do that in an affordable way  and also to make the food very convenient to feed, that was where the  difficulty was.  So, we really didn't focus on marketing for the first  three years or so.  It really grew by word of mouth.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, how are you selling it?  Brett, how is -- how are -- is the  dog food sold essentially?  Like, do you advertise on podcasts?  It's  direct to consumer?  Are you in stores at all?  </p><p>REGEV:  Yes, so we're just -- we're just starting to now.  So, it's online  only and it's direct to consumer.  Because direct to consumer is the really  -- the only way that we could keep the food fresh and convenient.  </p><p>So, basically how that works is you go online, you enter your dog's  information.  And we take all of that into account.  We create a custom  plan for them and then that feeds back into our very complicated supply  chain that can then deliver the food fresh.  So food actually comes in this  package, right, so it's personalized for your dog.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can hand it to me.  </p><p>REGEV:  Sure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks.  </p><p>REGEV:  So, it's pre-portioned for your dog.  Your dog's name will be on  it.  And that's -- thank you, you're very good.  And that's mainly so we  know exactly how much you have at any given time, right?  And so, before  you run out, our kitchens are making food.  </p><p>FORBES:  (INAUDIBLE) Starbucks for dogs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.  </p><p>FORBES:  Bring your dog and you get high end foods at Starbucks.  </p><p>REGEV:  Dogs should be allowed at any cafe.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I agree.

I'm Dagen  McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Friday, January 11th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The shutdown entering day 21.  Tied for the longest in U.S. history.   President Trump now considering declaring a national emergency and using  disaster aid money to fund the border wall.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My sacred duty, most sacred  duty as president is to defend the people of our nation.  That's whether  it's from foreign nations or along the border.  It's all defending our  people.  And defending them properly and strongly and really rightly,  justly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meantime futures are showing this this morning.  29 point loss,  30 point loss on the DOW futures.  Investors are waiting for some headway,  like some evidence that a trade deal is coming together with China,  although optimistic about the progress so far.</p><p>Yesterday all three of the major market gauges gained about half of 1  percent, markets on their longest winning streak since early October.</p><p>In Europe, we have some losses to report across the board, in England,  France and Germany, although slight there.</p><p>And your Asian markets -- all four major Asian markets finishing higher  overnight.</p><p>Oil heading to the plus side this morning.  The price of crude oil on its  longest upward swing since January of 2010. </p><p>Plus, Hail Mary, details on Apple's plan for a new phone that the company  hopes will pull it out of that iPhone sales slump.</p><p>And shark attack, the hit song, \"Baby Shark\", makes history.  We will bury  it in your head and you will not be able to get rid of it.</p><p>Here with me to break it all down -- CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell; Forbes Media chairman and former Republican presidential candidate,  Steve Forbes; and Fox News contributor, 32Advisors founder and CEO, former  economic advisor to President Obama -- Robert Wolf.  Welcome one and all.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:   Great first hour.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're such a flatterer.  </p><p>WOLF:  Great first hour.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because you're here and you're here and you're here.</p><p>Somebody already called me a nasty name on Twitter.  But I'll take that.   That's fine.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN:  Just think of that shark song.  It  works with three-year-olds and one-year-olds.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you know the song -- Steve?  </p><p>FORBES:  I'm not going to hurt your ratings by citing it but my three-year- old can cite it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just love that -- deeply and profoundly.  So we'll get to that  later this hour.</p><p>But right now our top story -- weighing a national emergency, White House  aides exploring new options to fund a southern border wall as lawmakers  remain at a standstill over any deal.  The White House directing the Army  Corps of Engineers to divert money from other areas like disaster relief  projects to secure funding if necessary.</p><p>President Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News that a border wall is the  only solution.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  It's common sense.  It really is, when you think of it, whether  you're into the world of law enforcement like these incredible folks behind  us (AUDIO GAP) so easily.  I mean it would make their job so much better.   And they could also go to other areas because we have the wall, you don't  need so many people.  We would probably pay for that many times in one  year.</p><p>The law is very clear.  I mean we have the absolute right to declare a  national emergency.  And this is security stuff.  This is a national  emergency.</p><p>If you don't have a barrier, whether it's a steel barrier or a concrete  wall, substantial and strong, you are never going to solve this problem.   You're never going to solve it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now Fox News contributor, former speaker of the house  and author of \"Trump's America\", Newt Gingrich.</p><p>Mr. Speaker -- it's always a pleasure to see you.  I am dying to hear what  you have to say about this.  What do you say about the President  potentially using emergency authority to get this wall built?  </p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I mean if the lawyers tell him  that it will withstand a court challenge, he has every right to do it.   He's commander in chief and the Congress has allocated money for the  defense of the United States.</p><p>But I do think that there's a certain value to him fighting this out.   Every day that goes by, it's more obvious that the Democrats don't value  the safety of Americans nearly as much as they value the convenience of  people trying to get here illegally.  </p><p>And every day that goes by I think the fact that the Democrats won't  compromise, you know, Nancy Pelosi saying if you give me everything I want,  I still won't give you the wall.  I think that attitude is a really bad way  for them to start with a new Congress.</p><p>And so I think in many ways this is a key moment for the President in  defining what's at stake for the country and in shaping the next two years.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will the Republicans continue to stand with him?  That's what --  in terms of will their knees buckle or do they have -- do they have the  guts -- </p><p>GINGRICH:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- to stand with him?</p><p>GINGRICH:  It doesn't matter.  If he's prepared to veto a bill, he's  certainly going to keep one-third plus one of the Senate and one-third plus  one of the House, so he'll sustain any veto he wants.  If some Republicans  at the margin want to be timid, they want to be panicked, they want to run  in circles, you know, the way our constitutional system works, a president  who is tough and determined has enormous advantages.</p><p>And I think that he in many ways can relax and just say -- you know, first  of all, Senator McConnell said he won't bring up a bill the President won't  sign.  So it's not going to go through the Senate.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi can -- you know, she can perform a ballet act, she can dance  in circles, she can jump up and down, she would have gymnast -- it won't  matter.  It's not going to change anything.  She can't force it through.  </p><p>FORBES:  Mr. Speaker, sounds like you don't think the President should  declare a national emergency but simply let the thing play out.  Is that  what you're saying?  You'd advise him not to do that?  He's winning  already, why mess it up?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well look, I think if you got -- I mean first of all, I think  what he said all along is the right position.  He is not going to sign this  appropriation unless they solve -- </p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>FORBES:  But you don't think he should do the national emergency?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  -- commit themselves to solving it.</p><p>FORBES:  You're saying he can't but you don't think he should?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  I think that it is less powerful than winning this fight.  He's  got to decide what he wants to do.  But I always tell people, when you  start thinking about any kind of campaign -- military, political -- you  always have to say then what.  Ok?</p><p>Tomorrow morning he declares a national emergency.  It goes to court  immediately.  But nonetheless, we're moving in the right direction.  He  can't really declare victory over the Congress.  I mean at that point what  he's done is had a clever detour to get around the congress and that's not  going to solve the long-term problem. </p><p>The long-term problem is Nancy Pelosi who has a crazy wing of her party  now, a wing which is totally out of touch with reality.  Nancy Pelosi right  now thinks that she is the equal to the President.</p><p>I went through this.  And we won and ultimately got a very important  agreement with President Clinton because we had a principled positive goal.   Nancy Pelosi's goal is purely negative.  </p><p>Our goal was to get to a balanced budget which as you know, Steve, we were  the only people in your lifetime to produce four consecutive balanced  budgets.  And that came out of having what was tied today as the longest  shutdown in history.  You don't do these things lightly.  </p><p>FORBES:  -- which just quickly, Mr. Speaker, gets to another thing.  The  Democrats are talking about a 70 percent tax rate and all that kind of  thing.  When are the Republicans going to put something exciting on the  table and go on offense, like a flat tax, put something exciting out there  for the American people instead of letting the Democrats dominate the  agenda on taxes?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well, I hope they'll do it pretty quickly.  Although I must say,  if you want to think about a suicidal party, being the party that runs next  year vote for me and I'll raise your taxes to 70 percent, I don't see how a  New Yorker survives that.  I hope every successful person in New York is  looking at what the left wing of the party wants to do to them.</p><p>Because as you know, when you combine state, city and federal taxes, a 70  percent rate just would be a killer.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the congresswoman who threw that idea out there, how many  days had she been an actual member of Congress.  And they put her on \"60  Minutes\" for Pete's sake but that's another problem.</p><p>The government shutdown reaching day 21, Newt -- Mr. Speaker -- which in  day 21, that ties the '95, '96 government shutdown under the Clinton  administration.  You remember this well.  You were speaker -- you were just  talking about it.  You were speaker during the shutdown.</p><p>It was -- if you look back, though, do you have any regrets about what  happened back then?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  No.  And I think the Washington establishment is just totally  wrong about this.  We were the first Republican congress in 40 years.  We  had a position we believed in deeply.  We were prepared to fight over it.   The reward was in 1996 we became the first Republican House reelected since  1928.</p><p>I mean all these so-called Washington smart people go around and say boy,  that really hurt the Republicans.  We're the first people that got  reelected in 68 years.  And it's because our base believed that we're real,  that we were committed to welfare reform.  We're committed to the largest  capital gains tax cut in history.  We're committed to balancing the budget.</p><p>The President has the same thing going for him.  I mean he has communicated  he's a man of strength.  He's a man of determination.  He is committed to  protecting Americans and I think every day that this goes on, the Democrats  are in danger of looking like a party that doesn't care about American  lives, doesn't care about American families, and is frankly the party of  illegal immigration rather than protecting Americans.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get your reaction to Senator Kamala Harris who  dismissed President Trump's border wall fight when she was on the late show  with Stephen Colbert.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  We have hundreds of thousands of  Americans who are not going to get paid and they're not getting paid  because the President of the United States has a vanity project that he  doesn't want to give up.  And it is outrageous.  It is irresponsible.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Vanity project, Mr. Speaker.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Look, Kamala Harris represents what I think of as California  crazy.  I mean California's a state and the governor in California just  said we're not only going to be a sanctuary state, we're going to have free  healthcare for everybody and the governor of California, the new governor  said and \"I specifically mean illegal immigrants\".</p><p>So he's sending a signal to the entire planet, if you can get to  California, we'll take care of your health problems for free.</p><p>That is the kind of policies -- the former mayor of San Francisco, a city  which now has people in hazmat suits paid $200,000 a year to walk around  all day and pick up human feces off the street because there are so many  homeless people in San Francisco which is by the way the largest center of  capital in the world in the last 25 or 30 years.</p><p>So you have a state which is nuts.  You have a senator who has no clue.   And you have a governor who is saying basically I'd like to have open  borders, be a sanctuary state and everybody who gets here, I will give them  a taxpayers cost-free healthcare which, of course, will destroy the  California health system.</p><p>I mean I just think there's a certain amount of craziness going on in  California and Kamala Harris is just part of it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So I'm putting you down as a no, you're not moving to  California.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  I love California as a state.  I just think its politicians have  gone crazy.  The state's wonderful.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  the people are lovely.  The state is beautiful.  But it's a  whole lot of crazy.  Mr. Speaker -- thank you so much.  Newt Gingrich --  great insight.</p><p>GINGRICH: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to bring you this.  President Trump's tweet on the  wall of the border, \"I often said during rallies with little variation that  Mexico will pay for the wall.  We have just signed a great new trade deal  with Mexico.  It is billions of dollars a year.  Better than the very bad  NAFTA deal which it replaces.  The difference pays for the wall many times  over.</p><p>There's an issue there, though.  That has to get ratified by Congress.   Nancy Pelosi, now the new speaker, has to take it up.  Will she just put it  in her drawer and say bye-bye? </p><p>It's another worry for the markets that we haven't even talked about but we  will as the show moves on.</p><p>Coming up, Apple rolling out new gear -- the tech giant unveiling three new  iPhone models this year despite slumping sales.  That story.</p><p>Plus parents of young children know this song well, \"Baby Shark\" swims into  the history books.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  U.S. troops have begun withdrawing from Syria.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hey -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey -- Dagen.  Yes.</p><p>A U.S. Defense official has now confirmed to Fox News that those troops are  being withdrawn on President Trump's orders to pull out of the country.   Military officials aren't sharing an exact time line or locations of the  troops, of course, for their safety.  But the full withdrawal that  President Trump is calling for overall may be a bit delayed.</p><p>U.S. National security advisor John Bolton said earlier this week that  troops won't be pulled out until ISIS is completely defeated and Kurdish  fighters are guaranteed protection from Turkey.</p><p>Well, more trouble for Huawei.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" says an executive  for the Chinese telecom company has been arrested in Poland and charged  with espionage.  The suspect is Huawei's local sales director who is a  Chinese national.  The former deputy head of Poland's IT Security  Department also is in custody, we should add.  This latest arrests coming  amid concerns by the U.S. and other western governments that Beijing is  using Huawei, the company, to spy on those countries.</p><p>Well, Apple reportedly is planning to introduce three new LCD iPhones this  fall, despite the struggling 10R sales.  And yes, I said iPhones.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that Apple is going to unveil new  camera features including a triple rear camera for the highest end model.   Apple is sticking with LCD this year.  But it's considering dropping its  LCD models next year.</p><p>AlphaOne Capital Partners' founding partner Dan Niles was on MORNINGS WITH  MARIA earlier this week.  He said Apple is focusing on the wrong products.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  5G is a really big deal.  If  5G is on the horizon and I know that want to get the latest, greatest on my  phone, but an iPhone is not compatible to 5G, why would I buy an iPhone?  </p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL:  That's a really good point.   And so I think when you think about 2019, 5G is going to roll out -- it's  going to start rolling out to their carriers in the June quarter.</p><p>Well, Apple doesn't have a 5G phone out.  So if you're trying to convince  somebody hey, you want to spend $1,000.  Well, does it have 5G?  Well no.   So then they'll wait.</p><p>So I think this year could actually be worse than last year in terms of how  much the smartphone market shrinks.  Apple not having 5G is an even bigger  problem.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: All right.  Let's take a look at shares of Apple in the premarket,  unchanged right now -- Dagen.  And you know, you've also led some great  discussions this week on Apple -- Dagen, in particular, how many $1,000  phones do consumers need?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  And Apple is upping the amount of money that you get  on a trade-in, trying to get people to -- to get people into these phones.</p><p>Thank you so much -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey -- I want to get your reaction to something because it's  not just Apple.  And we're going to talk about it later in the show but the  retail.  Macy's stock had its worst one day performance ever I think  yesterday on weak sales.  So again, that was hard on the markets, hard on  that sector, for sure.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  For sure.  And you know what, I  think what surprised me the most is that the conversation yesterday was  about the consumer being dense (ph).  Not about what was really plaguing  retail at the end of third quarter earnings was what about trade and how is  that going to impact the cost of goods and things, apparel and things that  they're selling.</p><p>I think that this is going to be -- still be a very good holiday sales  season, like the Mastercard numbers you got as well as some of the other  data we're seeing in retail sales is going to show that there are winners  and losers within the retail space.  And I think Amazon and Walmart are  going to be some of the biggest winners.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Elle Brands which is the owner of Victoria's secret also  was down about 5 percent yesterday -- tepid holiday sales.  This is a front  page story in the \"Wall Street Journal\" which we warned you about because  again, women are not buying that garbage that is like some standard of  beauty that nobody is not related to anybody's life anymore.  And they keep  just pushing ahead with this thing from the early '90s.  </p><p>You've got be innovative, you've got to be doing e-commerce right.  That's  where you're going to win.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  And I will get your response to Speaker  Gingrich.  I want to know because -- </p><p>WOLF:  I'm going to wait until we have him back on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you can't.  I'm going to make you talk about it.  </p><p>Coming up, markets on a winning streak -- we're looking at stocks and how  the government shutdown is impacting the IPO market in the New Year.</p><p>And social media's impact, one study finding heavy Facebook use could be  impairing your decision making.  Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The government shutdown now tied for the longest in the nation's  history.  Tomorrow it will be the longest if it lasts.  And it could delay  IPOs in 2019 in the New Year.</p><p>Joining us now, PWC partner, head of financial services Neil Dhar.  Neal --  great of you to be here.</p><p>NEIL DHAR, PWC PARTNER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's the impact right now?</p><p>DHAR:  Right now it's very difficult to get an IPO out in the marketplace  because you need a regulator to sort of sign off on the document.  There is  no regulator at the moment other than emergency things.  So what we're  seeing is December had a lot of volatility in the marketplace.  So it was  very slow from an IPO standpoint.</p><p>And now, we're not going to see many things, basically what happens in  January is if you don't get IPOs out immediately, then folks will wait for  year-end earnings.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So isn't this is a blessing for these companies, though, in some  way?  Because it gives them cover.  Kathleen smith, who researches wait for  year-end earnings.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So isn't this is a blessing for these companies, though, in some  way?  Because it gives them cover.  Because Kathleen Smith, who researches  IPOs, was on this program and she thought the market was so rotten at the  end of the year that it could be closed for IPOs at least in the first  quarter so it gives them a little bit of cover to take some time and wait  for the market to recover.  Do you agree with that?  </p><p>DHAR:  Well, I think 2018 was a very good year for IPOs.  There was about  215 IPOs which is actually a very good year.  Usually anything over 200 we  believe is a strong year.</p><p>So we have that momentum.  You're right, things did slow down at the back  end of the year.  Volatility is usually a very big pain point in the unless  you get into </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She was really talking about the performance in the second half  of the year, the companies that did go public.  </p><p>DHAR:  We did see that.  We did see a drop in relation to the IPOs that  went out at the beginning of the year, traded up versus the one that's came  out at the back end.  </p><p>FORBES:  And Neil -- I think what you said, volatility is the key point.   We have volatility with the government shutdown, with geopolitical risk,  with trade, with tax 1.0 versus 2.0, with fiscal, with fed.  And a company  -- we can live on good and/or bad news.  But what we struggle with is when  we have no idea what the future may be -- </p><p>DHAR:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  -- which is why this government shutdown.  The idea that we have  regulators not able to work.  We have the FDA not able to work.  These  impact all companies, whether it's going into earnings season or it's going  into IPO season or it's going into retail sales.  You know, are we going to  get the right numbers?</p><p>So what do you tell your customers how to deal with this whole volatile  situation?  </p><p>DHAR:  There's certain things you can control, certain things you can't.   So what we see from an IPO to be strong in the marketplace, good  management, strong growth, strong cash flows -- that's what they can  control from a story standpoint.</p><p>The other stuff, you have to be ready and one of the things that we preach  as we help our clients think through this stuff is you've to be ready.</p><p>An IPO is about a nine to 12-month process to get ready.  And you never  know what's going to happen in a marketplace and when you could actually  dip in into the market place in a favorable moment.  </p><p>BELL:  Can I just ask one question though on IPOs?  81 percent -- I saw a  stat from the University of Florida this year were unprofitable companies.   That rivals 2000 when we were in the dot-com bubble.  So what does that  signal about where we are in the cycle of IPOs or maybe even in the  business cycle.  </p><p>DHAR:  Well, we've seen -- IPOs come in a lot of different flavors.  You  have cash stable companies, a lot of the sponsor backed companies are  actually cash stable companies.  We have seen a big uptick in relation to  get tech and pharma life sciences IPOs. </p><p>And those companies will have that type of profile, strong revenue growth,  but potentially loss-making type of companies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At least it doesn't smack of the same type of companies that  were going public back in 2000, companies that just seemed really  ridiculous that barely had a business plan.</p><p>I don't think that -- at least I don't get the same sensation.  </p><p>DHAR:  And there's a lot more diligence in relation to what the investors  are asking for, what companies are being asked on the road shows, the level  of diligence feels different.</p><p>FORBES:  I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Neil it's good to see you.  I've lived through -- thank God I  lived through that.</p><p>Neil Dhar -- Good to see you.  </p><p>DHAR:  Thanks again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up taking on big technology, our next guest says that  customers and congress need to stand up to some of the biggest companies in  the world.</p><p>Plus, baby shark attack.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The YouTube children's song, now a historical success.  The  story has parents everywhere bopping and shaking their heads.</p><p>We make Steve Forbes sing it, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Friday, January 11th.  Your top  stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p>The shutdown showdown enters day 21.  Now tied for the longest in U.S.  history.  President Trump considering declaring a national emergency and  using disaster aid to fund the border wall.  </p><p>Futures are heading lower this morning, ever so slight.  Tough to make the  connection between the shutdown and the markets at this point because we've  had a great run.  We've got a 20 point loss on the Dow Futures right now.   The major markets gauges gained about half of one percent yesterday and  they're on track for their longest winning streak since early October, but  really before that massive selloff at the end of the year.  </p><p>In Europe we have some selling to report in England, France and Germany,  although slight, losses of about half of one percent in France and Germany  at the moment.  </p><p>Asia markets, different story, finishing higher overnight, all four there.  </p><p>Recall alert, FiatChrysler warning of a potentially dangerous flaw  impacting 1.6 million vehicles but there's an even bigger issue.  We have  the details.  </p><p>Then addicted to Facebook, we'll tell you about new research that says  using the social media app could be as bad as a cocaine addiction.  </p><p>And shark attack, the hit song baby shark making history.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, taking on technology.  Companies like  Facebook and Google are bigger than ever.  In fact, the number of Facebook  users now exceeds the populations of China, the United States and Brazil  combined.  Google oversees 90 percent of all online searches.  Between  those two companies, they control roughly two-thirds of all advertising  online.  </p><p>My next guest says there more has to be done to rein these companies in.   She has an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle, consumers, congress: stand  up to tech giants, saying this.  When a small cadre of companies begins to  operate as retailers, news aggregators, advertising platforms and  information keepers, they don't just rise to the top of the marketplace,  they become the marketplace.  Walling off competition in a way that  threatens the very idea of consumer choice.  </p><p>Joining me now, consumer reports president and CEO, Marta Tellado.  Good to  see you Marta this morning.  </p><p>MARTA TELLADO, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, CONSUMER REPORTS:  Great to be here, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you mean by this op-ed?  What should consumers do?  What  should Congress do?  </p><p>TELLADO:  Well, think about it.  Our founders were great believers in the  free market and competition but the thing about free market, you also need  free choice.  How do consumers have free choice when they don't have  knowledge or transparency about what's in the marketplace?  So we need  transparency.  We need accountability.  We also need some changes.  The  physics of this new reality are very different.  </p><p>So, we don't really have the rules and regulations in place to even think  and contemplate how to hold these companies accountable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you say rules and regulations, though, Steve's neck turns  bright red.  But Steve, do you -- what do you have to say to Marta's  editorial?  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, in terms of regulations, I  think again, you're going to get national regulations if only because  states are starting to do crazy things.  You don't want to vulcanized  market which would hurt everybody.  So I think it's a preemption.  You will  get something national.  </p><p>But in terms of -- in terms of getting information out there, it's as open  as it's ever been before.  What I want to ask you is, we said the same  thing about IBM, said the same thing about Microsoft, said the same thing  about Walmart, Amazon, now we say about Amazon.  Aren't there things  they're going out there that are going to upend these people like 5G or new  technologies that are going to undo them like they've always done before?  </p><p>TELLADO:  Here's the difference, I think it's yes, we have seen behavior  like this before.  We haven't quite seen so few companies like big tech  that are controlling so much.  As I said in the op-ed, they're not just  tech companies, they are ad platforms.  They are retailers.  They are  controlling our experience.  </p><p>So the dynamic, it's not just what we've seen before.  The physics of this  are entirely different.  It's too few of them and not enough transparency  for consumers to make decisions and --  </p><p>FORBES:  Do you think block chain technology, have you look at that as a  way of getting our privacy back?  </p><p>TELLADO:  People are talking about block chain technology, Bitcoin.  Those  things are thought about, talked about, they're not a reality for everyday  consumers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about personal choice, Aurora?  I know you want to get in  here.  But again, if consumers just turn their backs on some of these  companies in a way, it's different if you talk about the way that ads are  served online and that's tougher.  But in terms of Facebook, people could  just stop using the platform and really pull back and maybe that would give  rise to alternatives who would be -- with companies that would be more  transparent.  But that just seems like a really long road ahead.  </p><p>TELLADO:  I think you're seeing that already and particularly with young  audiences turning away from Facebook.  But the choices are not there and  the information they need, these companies are not being transparent about  the information they're using.  Consumers are really being victimized by  these incredible technologies that are delighting us but they're also  limiting our choice in terms of pricing, in terms of the whole experience  that we have in our daily lives.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  So Marta, you know, it's a bit of a  double edged sword because I love what you wrote.  But we applaud the  shared services economy because it makes it, one, more efficient for us  all.  Two, actually pricing has gone down, not up in the shared services  economy.  So, in a consumer driven country like ours which is 73 percent  consumer driven to the head of consumer -- to your company, that's a good  thing.  </p><p>TELLADO:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  Now, on the flip side, I agree with you on the regulation side.   Because isn't Facebook and these companies, shouldn't they be regulated no  different than the Wall Street Journal and Fox because really they dominate  advertising, they dominate -- you know, eyeballs.  And I think that's what  you're saying, that there has to be a level playing field for what I would  say is the more mature companies or the older school companies that are  innovating maybe at the same pace, but they don't yet have a oligopoly and  monopoly (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And to that point, Congress could remove the liability waiver  that these social media companies have.  They have a liability waiver for  user generated content because they say they're not media companies.  So,  that is something that Congress could do, but go ahead.  </p><p>TELLADO:  But let me get to something you said, Robert, and that is about  price and quality.  Yes, we're seeing great stuff there.  What we're not  seeing -- we're seeing price and quality.  But what about privacy and  security?  I don't think that things on the books today even come close to  addressing that.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well that's why I'm a supporter of block chain protocol.  I think  it's going to -- I think it's going to proliferate a lot faster than the  marketplace.</p><p>TELLADO:  And we're anxious to see that.  But in -- but in the meantime,  what are the standards by which consumers can go into the marketplace and  make choices about products were in privacy and security and there aren't.   And which is what -- that's caused us to innovate as well.  So what we're  doing is we have developed a whole series of tests and protocols so that  consumers can actually make a choice about which period -- payment app is  going to be the safest for them, and that's exactly what we did.  </p><p>And guess what, as soon as we started testing and creating these standards,  companies started competing against them and saying we want to be number  one, we want to have the best smart T.V. that protects your privacy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>TELLADO:  So, there are ways to incentivize.  It's not all just regulation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The problem is that you touch on, is that there is all the power  is in a few hands.  You talk about millennials leaving Facebook.  Well,  they're using Instagram which Facebook owns.  </p><p>TELLADO:  Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I never understood why that was allowed to happen.  Again, these  nerd robber barons who are controlling all of our information and tracking  everything that we do.  </p><p>TELLADO:  Well, I think what all these companies are really excelling at in  addition to delighting us is being consumer trust busters.  I mean,  consumer trust right now is at an all-time low.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Marta, great to see you.  Tellado, did I say it right?  </p><p>TELLADO:  You did indeed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK, great.  That was very important to me.  Marta, great to see  you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>TELLADO:  Great to be here, thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's our highlight reel from this week.  Must see moments from  the show.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president doesn't  want a government shutdown.  He wants the government to open, but he also  wants it to do its job.  </p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE:  The shutdown is not  good.  But my bigger complaint is that America may be because of bipartisan  politics has been unable to do a lot of things that need to be done.  If  your one of those folks out there, you're a J.P. Morgan Chase client, we're  going to help you.  Call in and we're going to get you some help deferring  payments.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  How long can the credit  markets stay this tight before you actually do see it as a worry sign?  </p><p>DIMON:  For a while.  I'm really not worried about it.  I think -- I think  you're just having -- if you look at it the other way around, credit  spreads were abnormally low for a long time.  This is more maybe a little  bit of a normalization.  And you know, you and I both know that the tip of  the ice -- the tip of the spear is IPOs and high yield.  So when people --  when sentiment changes dramatically those are usually the first two areas  where people cut back and then they kind of open up over time.  </p><p>MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR, ALLIANZ:  In 12 months we've gone  from the hope of synchronized pick up in global growth with everybody doing  better to divergence with the U.S. outpacing Europe and China.  And now,  we're worried about the wrong type of convergence.  We're worried about the  U.S. slowing to the rest of the world instead of the rest of the world  picking up towards us.  </p><p>It's for the Fed to realize that it can't be on auto pilot.  That it has to  be more sensitive to what's happening not just in the U.S. economy, but  also to what's happening globally.  </p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  Not sure Apple  realizes the real issue is that they're trying to sell a Ferrari in the  market that can afford a Ford.  This is why Apple's been losing market  shares.  They actually went from the second largest vendor of phones in the  world, Huawei passed them out of China to become the second largest.  </p><p>KEN FRAZIER, CEO, MERCK:  We want to work with the administration and  Congress, both parties to ensure that patients can have meaningful access  to drugs and affordability is a real problem.  The question is, how do we  solve the affordability problem for today's patients.  We've shown already  that Keytruda as immunotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy can  significantly reduce the amount of deaths.  So, with respect to newly  diagnosed people with the most common form of lung cancer called non  squamous lung cancer we're able to reduce the death rate by 51 percent.   There's never been anything like that.  </p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL ANALYST:  Started Amazon during  their marriage, dollar for dollar it was amassed during that marriage,  right down the middle, 50 percent generally would go to the spouse.   Anything that he comes out with a statement that can impact the shares of  stock and the value of it can result in a shareholder derivative suit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Harley Davidson unveiling a new motorcycle later this year.   Joining us right now is Harley Davidson chief marketing officer Heather  Malenshek.</p><p>HEATHER MALENSHEK, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, HARLEY DAVIDSON:  As we think  about -- I mean, electric vehicles they're becoming much more mainstream  but two-wheel mobility -- electric two-wheel mobility is relatively new  trend and we are setting out to lead the electrification of motorcycling.   So, this is all part of our More Roads plan that we launched last year,  which was around broader access to the brands, so opening up new markets  and new channels.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump continues to tweet this morning.  H1B holders,  he's talking about visas.  H1B holders in the United States can rest  assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and  certainty to your stay including a potential path to citizenship.  We want  to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in  the U.S.  That's a biggy -- that is a biggy -- that is --  </p><p>FORBES:  That may lay the basis for resolving this crisis because it gives  something that California H1B visas have been severely restricted.  You  start to throw that out there, along with DACA, you've got a deal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Steve drops the mic.  FiatChrysler meantime issuing a major  recall over potentially dangerous flaws.  Cheryl Casone has the details  that you need to know, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, this is interesting,  Dagen.  FiatChrysler recalling more than 1.6 million vehicles worldwide to  replace Takata airbags.  These airbags can explode with too much force and  send shrapnel flying.  The affected models include the 2010 through 2016  Jeep Wrangler and the 2010 Ram pickup.  This is the third recall over  Takata airbags just this week alone.  At the recalls by Toyota and Ford.   And Takata as you know, it's been in the news for years over airbag  troubles.  Chrysler, the stock down 28 percent from one year ago.  </p><p>Well, a new study finding that heavy Facebook users make impaired decisions  like similar to drug addicts basically.  Researchers tested about 70  participants with an exercise.  Psychologist used to measure decision  making.  Based on the people who admitted being excessive Facebook users  did worse on the test than those who didn't use Facebook as often.  Shares  of Facebook are lower in the premarket, down more than half a percent.  </p><p>And then finally, parents of young children, you should be so excited  because the song baby shark has become a smash hit with little kids and now  it is on this week's billboard hot 100.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.  Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.   Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.  Baby shark!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  This music video has racked up more than 2.1 billion views on  YouTube.  The song has actually been around since 2015.  But it got popular  last week -- last year, excuse me, when a social media challenge asked  listeners to record themselves doing this is the baby shark dance.  So yes,  if you have young kids at home, you thought frozen was bad mom and dad, get  ready for baby shark, I know.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's Steve, baby shark doo doo doo doo doo doo.  Steve's doing  it.  I'm going to be doing that all day long.  </p><p>FORBES:  We've got two young grandchildren, three and-a-half and one and-a- half, and the only way they eat food is you have that device in front of  them playing baby shark.  We sing along with them.  They eat the food.   It's great.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was helpful hints from grandfather Steve Forbes.  </p><p>FORBES:  Meet all needs here.  Markets, parenting, babies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we address -- we address everyone's needs, absolutely.  </p><p>Coming up, healthy food for man's best friend.  We talk to one company that  wants your dog eating as well as you, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Delicious, delectable, high end dog food, a new personalized pet  meal start-up called The Farmer's Dog boasts that meals are made -- freshly  made and healthy even humans can eat them and they're delivered to your  door.  </p><p>Joining me now, the co-founders of The Farmer's Dog Brett Podolsky and  Jonathan Regev.  Jonathan and good to see you both.  And Brett, to you  first.</p><p>BRETT PODOLSKY, CO-FOUNDER, THE FARMER'S DOG:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, I'm going to hold up this delicious bowl of -- it looks like  tuna and corn, and broccoli and squash and carrots.  So this is not just  for people but for your dog.  </p><p>JONATHAN REGEV, CO-FOUNDER, THE FARMER'S DOG:  Yes, it's for your dog.   It's actually turkey.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turkey.  It looks delicious.  But how did you guys come up with  the idea for the -- for the company?  </p><p>PODOLSKY:  Well, it all started with my dog, Jada.  She was sick for the  first two years that I had her.  I was desperate to find the solution for  her.  And after trying every pet food and going to several vets, finally a  vet recommended that I tried home cooking for her and it was like magic,  all of her symptoms disappeared.  </p><p>And it made me wonder what was going on with pet food because I used -- the  vet recommended that I use the exact same ingredients that were on the pet  food label that I had been feeding her.  But when I cooked it, the result  was very different.  It wasn't brown balls, it looked like actual food.   And her stomach symptoms were cured.  </p><p>So, I wanted something better for her.  And after doing a lot of research  into the pet industry and for anybody that has done any research into how  they make pet food, it's pretty alarming.  So, I wanted something better  for her.  And after realizing there was just no companies out there that I  felt comfortable feeding her, we decided to build that company.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, how did you build the company, Jonathan?  How did you --  how are you getting this message out to consumers who might just be  ordering their dog food from Amazon?  </p><p>REGEV:  Sure, yes.  So, at first, we really didn't focus on marketing.  It  was really difficult and complicated to create the supply chain needed.   And also, the technology to create a subscription to have food look like  this.  </p><p>Because remember, this food in particular, it's not meant to look pretty.   And it's not meant to look fancy.  It's just -- you know, fresh food.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it does look fresh -- it does look fresh.  </p><p>REGEV:  And it is fresh.  And so that -- to do that in an affordable way  and also to make the food very convenient to feed, that was where the  difficulty was.  So, we really didn't focus on marketing for the first  three years or so.  It really grew by word of mouth.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, how are you selling it?  Brett, how is -- how are -- is the  dog food sold essentially?  Like, do you advertise on podcasts?  It's  direct to consumer?  Are you in stores at all?  </p><p>REGEV:  Yes, so we're just -- we're just starting to now.  So, it's online  only and it's direct to consumer.  Because direct to consumer is the really  -- the only way that we could keep the food fresh and convenient.  </p><p>So, basically how that works is you go online, you enter your dog's  information.  And we take all of that into account.  We create a custom  plan for them and then that feeds back into our very complicated supply  chain that can then deliver the food fresh.  So food actually comes in this  package, right, so it's personalized for your dog.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can hand it to me.  </p><p>REGEV:  Sure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks.  </p><p>REGEV:  So, it's pre-portioned for your dog.  Your dog's name will be on  it.  And that's -- thank you, you're very good.  And that's mainly so we  know exactly how much you have at any given time, right?  And so, before  you run out, our kitchens are making food.  </p><p>FORBES:  (INAUDIBLE) Starbucks for dogs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.  </p><p>FORBES:  Bring your dog and you get high end foods at Starbucks.  </p><p>REGEV:  Dogs should be allowed at any cafe.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I agree.  And you're welcome back on that note, Jonathan and  Brett.</p><p>REGEV:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Please come back both of you.  </p><p>REGEV:  Appreciate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back, everybody.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

When it comes to voicing a contrary opinion on the most sensitive political and cultural topics, however, many of our tongues are tied and our fingers shy away from the keyboard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Better not to say anything, we reason, than to deal with the blowback.</p><p> The answer to this speech-chilling political correctness is not a new law but personal courage, free speech attorney-turned-writer David French of the National Review Institute argued this past week in a speech in Atlanta.</p><p> \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a position that is different from the classic defense of free speech in this country,\u201d French said.</p><p> Rather than admitting none of us knows everything, and thus some humility is in order, too many Americans won\u2019t accept they may need to change their minds from time to time. Or that they would benefit from explaining their own opinion, and not shouting down their opponents.</p><p> Much of the problem stems from what\u2019s been called \u201cthe big sort\u201d \u2013 the physical movement of people toward places where their neighbors will be more like-minded.</p><p> \u201cAmericans are less likely to live near and work with people who disagree with them than at any time since we\u2019ve been measuring that,\u201d French said.</p><p> But because people tend to become more extreme in their views when they only talk with those who agree with them, we\u2019ve lost not only our willingness to engage with others but the belief we even need to do so.</p><p> How bad has it gotten?</p><p> \u201cPeople are more likely to prefer their son or daughter marry a person of a different faith than a different political party,\u201d French said, quipping that for many on the right, \u201ceternal damnation is preferable to a Democrat.\u201d</p><p> Although these attitudes concern politics, count French as someone who does not believe there\u2019s a political solution.</p><p> Rather, a cultural solution is needed. And that\u2019s where the personal courage comes in.</p><p> \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be intimidated into silence,\u201d he said, because that silence becomes self-reinforcing and makes it harder to speak up the next time.</p><p> But the answer is not to fight fire with fire.</p><p> \u201cThe opposite of political correctness is not acting like a jerk,\u201d French said. \u201cIt\u2019s speaking the truth with grace and humility and fearlessness. There is such a thing as being fearlessly reasonable.\u201d</p><p> Along with that is a legal corollary to the Golden Rule: \u201cDefend the rights of others that you would like to exercise yourself.\u201d</p><p> And an answer to the \u201csnowflake\u201d mentality on many college campuses: \u201cDo your best to be unoffendable. Be a walking safe space for speech.\u201d</p><p> French takes as much abuse on social media (specifically Twitter) as anyone I observe.</p><p> But while he acknowledges those platforms \u201cput human nature on blast,\u201d and not in a good way, he said they\u2019re not the root cause of these problems.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s as old as the high school cafeteria,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s peer pressure.\u201d</p><p> As in that context, the answer to political correctness is to stand up to the peer pressure rather than conform to it to stay with the \u201cin\u201d crowd.</p><p> Contrary to some pleas, however, he isn\u2019t for treating big tech companies like Facebook and Google as public utilities, or using antitrust power to break them up.</p><p> \u201cIf you have one \u2018woke\u2019 Google and you break into nine pieces, what are you going to have?\u201d he posited. \u201cNine \u2018woke\u2019 Googles.\u201d</p><p> The answer here is a mix of persuading the leaders of these behemoths not to stifle speech they don\u2019t like, while encouraging entrepreneurs who want to compete with them.</p><p> The worst approach would be to weaken that strong legal environment for free speech, and let government regulators decide what\u2019s OK to say.</p><p> \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we know about politics,\u201d he warned those who have the upper hand today, \u201cit\u2019s that no party maintains control for long.\u201d</p><p> (Kyle Wingfield is president and CEO of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.georgiapolicy.org\">www.georgiapolicy.org</url>.)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKGA-173C114B167F0A94</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289753E3E69F03 NWBKGA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7D-09Y1-DXVP-V14S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Community Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Never has the threat to our privacy, our democracy and the competitiveness of our economy posed by the likes of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon been so obvious.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet our government seems uncertain, even paralyzed, in the face of the multiple challenges posed by the tech giants that have come to rule so much of our daily lives.</p><p>In the United States, and especially in Europe, governments are taking strong action to counter some of the worst effects of Facebook et al. They've brought in laws to strengthen privacy protection for the tens of millions who rely on the online platforms. And they're updating copyright laws designed to protect the rights and livelihood of those who produce content that ends up online - everything from music to news.</p><p>Ottawa, by contrast, has been hesitant to act, and that's putting it kindly. In case after case, our federal government has chosen to tread lightly when it comes to dealing with the impact of the big tech companies on Canadians' privacy, on the spread of false and toxic information, and on the economic health of the companies that pay for original content only to see the tech giants scoop up much of the profit.</p><p>That's the overall conclusion to be drawn from a comprehensive survey of the issues involved in trying to rein in Big Tech by Star reporters Michael Lewis, May Warren and Jennifer Yang.</p><p>In one area after another, politicians in the United States, the European Union, even Australia, California and Quebec, are debating how to respond to the tech challenge. After years of being celebrated as champions of innovation and prosperity, they're now coming under well-deserved fire for playing fast and loose with customers' personal data, crushing competitors, contributing to inequality and poisoning democracy.</p><p>It's a perfect storm for tech, yet Ottawa seems to be content to sit on the sidelines and watch as others tackle the tough issues.</p><p>Take privacy, one of the biggest concerns for consumers in the wake of epic fails involving Facebook last year, including one affecting the personal information of 50 million users.</p><p>The European Union has pioneered privacy laws for the tech age with its General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect last May. It requires tech companies to be much more transparent about how they obtain consent from consumers, and what they do with the data they collect, and allows for fines of up to 4 per cent of a company's revenue.</p><p>French authorities fined Google a record $75 million in January for violating the law, and other investigations are under way elsewhere in Europe. This law promises to hit the tech companies where they hurt most - on their bottom line.</p><p>Is there any sign that our federal government is prepared to be similarly tough? In short, no. Canada's privacy law was developed in 2000, when smartphones were barely a gleam in Steve Jobs' eye, and doesn't provide for the kind of stiff fines that the EU law contains. A parliamentary committee last year recommended a tougher approach, but from the government so far, nothing.</p><p>What about the health of democracy? Germany has taken the toughest line, forcing tech firms to remove hate speech within 24 hours and employing moderators to police their content. In Britain, a parliamentary committee last week labelled Facebook and the like \"digital gangsters\" for allowing a torrent of \"disinformation\" to subvert democracy. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, government action seems inevitable. \"Self-regulation is no longer enough,\" editorializes the Guardian.</p><p>But in Ottawa, the Trudeau government has been much more cautious. Bill C-76 bans the use of foreign money by third-party advocacy groups and empowers a committee of senior bureaucrats to blow the whistle if any outside entity tries to interfere with next fall's federal election.</p><p>But the government did not follow the advice of an all-party Commons committee, which urged it to go a lot further and force Google, Facebook, etc., to up their game in removing \"manifestly illegal content.\" Instead, the government chose to go easy on the social media companies.</p><p>Finally, Europe is moving toward adopting a new copyright law that would force Google and Facebook to compensate content creators, or filter out copyright-protected content. The basic idea is that those who produce content (including news) should not have to stand by while Big Tech creams off the revenue. The new law isn't a done deal, but most EU countries signed on to the idea this month.</p><p>Canada, in contrast, has done nothing on this front. Ottawa is in the midst of a consultation on copyright law that is due to extend into 2020, well beyond the next election. Content producers, meanwhile, watch while social media companies profit by \"sharing\" their content.</p><p>The techlash was a long time coming, but it's turned into a howling storm.

This is to allow the reader to appreciate the nuanced spectrum that lies between the positions. My academic self is usually able to pull this off with little effort. With this Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics issue, I struggle to find the other side.</p><p>STEM degrees include study and research into physical, natural, biological and agricultural sciences; engineering; mathematics; or computer science. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for maintaining a complete list of subjects that are covered by the regulatory definition of a \"STEM field.\" This, alongside a labyrinthine taxonomy system serves as the basis for an Optional Practical Training extension. An OPT is the temporary work authorization that allows international students to work in the country to complement their studies. The general post-degree OPT is 12 months, but simply by the virtue of their degree being recognised as STEM, students are able to extend this period to three years. As a result, in the last few years, several leading U.S. business schools have either certified their existing master's programs as STEM or introduced new STEM components in response to student demand. Stanford University's Graduate School of Business is not one of them.</p><p>A management degree is usually considered a fast track into the elite tiers of business. This remained undisputed until the rise of 'Big Tech,' when suddenly a traditional science and engineering education were seen as more valuable than a general management degree. Top management schools such as Harvard, MIT and Stanford continue to lure the best and the brightest by pointing to their Nobel-winning teaching faculty, billions in endowment funds and enviably all-pervasive alumni networks. They also boast of an unparalleled supremacy in not only the technical offerings of their programs e.g. analytics, operations, finance and statistics, but also the cult-like popularity gained by soft-skill focused courses such as \"Touchy Feely,\" which teaches interpersonal dynamics at Stanford and \"Negotiation\" at Harvard. And yet, there has been a continued drop in applications to U.S. business schools over the past few years. According to the Graduate Management Admission Council's 2019 Report, international applications are down 13.7% for graduate business degrees at U.S. management schools for the 2019-2020 academic year. In contrast, applications are increasing to the graduate programs at business schools in Europe. Despite the chaos of Brexit, 64% of British MBA programs reported growth in their international application volumes. Not surprisingly, of the international students who had previously considered the U.S. as an educational destination in the past but did not actually apply, over half of them cited the limited ability to work in the United States following their studies as a key reason. Consider this unfortunate trend against the composition of a typical U.S. business school class, where almost half of the student population, if not more, used to be international. This is set to change.</p><p>The most popular route for highly skilled workers to remain and work in the U.S. has been the H-1B visa and yet, in 2019, approximately 200,000 applications were received for 85,000 visas. This drastically truncated cap does not mesh well with claims that U.S. is committed to prioritising merit-based immigration. Add to this the declining rate of international applications and rising rates of H-1B rejections and you have the recipe for a catastrophic shortfall of talent in the country. This tragic outcome is avoidable, as has been demonstrated by business schools across the U.S. who have changed their curriculum designation to be STEM (MIT, Haas, Rochester, Wisconsin, UGA) or have creatively offered 'tracks' or specializations in the form of optional courses (Duke, Wharton, Dartmouth, Michigan, USC, UConn) that would earn the students a STEM certification and therefore an OPT extension. While this doesn't completely solve the problem of a lottery-based authorization, it does give you more \"attempts\" at a win. Stanford is not blind to this, of course ? this time last year, undergraduate students with an economics major were allowed to apply for the STEM OPT extension due to their degree being designated as STEM (despite remaining a Bachelor of Arts award).</p><p>This is not to say that the GSB has played no part in furthering dialogue with the administration. In October 2019, the GSB's Dean, Jonathan Levin, was among 50 deans who urged the administration to \"remove 'per-country' visa caps and reform the H-1B visa program\" and expressed concern over the fact that most of the three million open STEM jobs in the country remained unfilled because \"the U.S. is not producing enough people with the skills to fill them.\"</p><p>A personal precipitating factor arrived for me when MIT declared all its graduate business programs as STEM earlier this year. Since that announcement by our East coast rival, I have been leading an emotionally-charged conversation with the GSB, trying to educate and mobilize our MBA and MS cohort, while emphasising the risk of Stanford losing its competitive position in a tough international education market.</p><p>The GSB's motto implores us to \"change lives, change organisations and change the world,\" yet the time it has taken the school to even appreciate the difference in opportunity provided by a STEM vs a regular degree is staggering. It has been four years since Wisconsin became the first business school to convert their business degree to STEM. Surely, we, the world changers at Stanford should have led the charge?</p><p>STEM or no STEM, a Stanford education will serve me and my peers well. We do not need to be reminded of this. Silicon Valley engine runs on the talent we produce and the deep connections the school has cultivated with the local VC and tech community. I have been personally supported by the Dean, Associate Deans and the administration team when I have proposed to orchestrate a discussion between them and the class (including domestic and international students). So, yes, we feel heard. The students also feel the desperate helplessness when the leadership speaks of the long timelines related to any change here at sunny Stanford. But my empathy reaches its limits when I look at the long list of business schools - none, in my opinion, of the stature of Stanford - who have argued for and ultimately delivered a STEM designated degree for their international students. Some really wild ones, yes, those annoying folk at Berkley glimmering in their blue and gold, made this happen retroactively! Their students who graduated in 2018 have also had their degrees smugly STEM-ified.</p><p>I strongly urge the administration to closely collaborate with comparable peer institutions and work toward obtaining a STEM classification for its MBA and MS degrees. Failing urgent action, the management programs at StanfordGSB will become unattractive for future applicants - especially international students for whom the three-year OPT is a vital element in their choice of school/program. This is a pivotal moment for the business school where they can either decide to maintain the status quo and lose the brightest of international applicants who most certainly will lean toward schools that deliver more value by making their post-study employment prospects easier or they can implement a change and argue for STEM classification.</p><p>The current management degrees have enough STEM appropriate material to merit the 24-month extension to the OPT. GSB's continued inaction very directly pushes its international cohort away, since prospective employers understandably hesitate to hire someone for 12 months who may or may not cross the H-1B hurdle. With a three-year OPT, business school graduates are not only given three real chances at the H-1B career roulette but are also saved from the perilous exploration of the jumble of 185 U.S. visa types. Pushing for STEM classification would make it explicit that the GSB is behind us and not silently abrogating its responsibility to its international students.</p><p>Contact Anupriya Dwivedi at adwivedi 'at' stanford.edu.</p><p>.css-10w0hkr{margin:0 auto;width:100%;}@media (min-width:1100px){.css-10w0hkr{width:650px;}}Anupriya DwivediAnupriya is a Masters student at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford.

(Image credit: L.A. Cicero)</p><p>Stanford researcher and former chief of security at Facebook Alex Stamos called for more cooperation between technology companies and the government, more interdisciplinary research into cybersecurity issues and a federal online privacy law during a lecture at Stanford on Tuesday.</p><p>The internet today is not an all-powerful democratization tool that its founders thought it would become, said Stamos, an adjunct professor at Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and a visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution.</p><p>Cybersecurity issues, such as the tension between online privacy and safety, abound and roadblocks impede the ability to solve these issues. Among the roadblocks, Stamos said, have been technology companies' unwillingness to cooperate with the government and the continued positive rhetoric from tech executives about their products.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley is based on optimism,\" he said. \"But (technology companies) never, ever talk about the downside. And the truth is the world is actually kind of a dark place... and if you build technology, it will be misused. And it's not bad for us to admit that.\"</p><p>Stamos' speech, titled \"The Battle for the Soul of the Internet,\" was delivered as the annual Drell Lecture, an event organized by Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC). The lecture is named for the late Sidney Drell, a theoretical physicist and arms control expert who was a co-founder of CISAC and former deputy director of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.</p><p>Prior to joining Stanford, Stamos served as the chief security officer at Facebook for two years until leaving the social networking company in August. During his time at Facebook, he led the company's investigation into manipulation of the 2016 U.S. election and helped create several protections against these new classes of abuse. In 2017, he co-authored \"Information Operations and Facebook,\" a highly cited examination of the influence campaign against the U.S. election.</p><p>Call for cooperation</p><p>The current complexities and tradeoffs of issues such as online privacy, safety, anonymity and integrity of information require technology companies, social scientists, governmental officials and others to work together, Stamos said.</p><p>\"We have some serious problems we have to work on,\" said Stamos, who is also a William J. Perry Fellow at CISAC. \"But we also have to focus on the fact that the internet is one of the most powerful tools for human freedom and democratization ever created. That is a feature we can still have if we are very careful in asking for it.\"</p><p>Stamos encouraged the next generation of technology leaders to be educated on cybersecurity and be informed about the history and past mistakes of big tech companies, so they are not doomed to repeat the mistakes again.</p><p>He also called for extensive interdisciplinary research into issues that intersect society, policy and technology some of which is already under way at Stanford.</p><p>\"One of the real reasons that I believe we're not well prepared for a secure election in 2018 or 2020 is because we are not working off of the same set of facts that we had in 2016,\" said Stamos, adding that he is part of a team at Stanford that is studying intelligence failures that happened during the 2016 U.S. election.</p><p>Importance of journalism</p><p>Stamos also highlighted the importance of journalism to a healthy democratic society and placed some of the blame for the economic struggles of local newspapers on technology companies.</p><p>\"Our society will not be healthy if we don't have a good economic model for journalism,\" Stamos said. \"And a lot of that lies on the shoulders of Silicon Valley. Nobody wanted to destroy the newspaper industry, but this was a consequence of allowing anyone to be a journalist and taking away the economics of things like classified (advertising)... And unfortunately, nobody in the Valley has stepped up to fix it.\"</p><p>Following the lecture, Stamos answered several questions from the audience and held a conversation with Andrew Grotto, a social science research associate at CISAC.</p><p>Stamos praised California's digital privacy law, which was passed in June, and said he believes the country needs a federal privacy law and a new independent governmental agency that enforces its rules.</p><p>The law, called the California Consumer Privacy Act, gives consumers a host of rights related to online privacy, including the right to find out what data companies have collected on them and what they do with the data.</p><p>\"I think it's great that California passed that law because it now forces Congress to act,\" Stamos said. \"But I do think we need a federal override (...) and we need a federal regulator team that is technically competent to interpret it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122460760</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5THF-7HV1-JCBF-S0B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 17, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Yet Scott Morton, a Yale University economist and former US Justice Department official, is also advising two of the biggest names in tech \u2013 Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc \u2013 as they confront federal antitrust investigations.    She didn\u2019t disclose those relationships in papers she recently co-authored outlining how the US could bring antitrust cases against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc.    Scott Morton, hailed in a 2019 article in the New Republic as an \u201cantitrust crusader\u201d, said she began consulting for Amazon in the last year, while her work for Apple dates back several years. She said she usually discloses her clients when speaking at conferences. The lack of disclosure on the Google and Facebook papers, she said, shouldn\u2019t be an issue because Apple and Amazon didn\u2019t pay her to write them. What\u2019s more, she added, those papers didn\u2019t focus on either Apple or Amazon.    \u201cI work for companies that I\u2019m comfortable are not breaking the law,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cSo you\u2019re articulating what is making the market work well and how the company\u2019s conduct is pro-competitive or efficient.\u201d    Ethics experts and the American Economic Association for years have wrestled with real and perceived conflicts due to academic economists\u2019 consulting work. As antitrust probes intensify, the potential for conflicts could multiply as regulators and companies hire experts who can play a crucial role in shaping cases involving claims of anti-competitive behaviour.    Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are all grappling with federal investigations. A Justice Department lawsuit against Google is likely to come this summer. The heads of all four companies are set to testify July 27 before a House panel. Facebook and Google also face state probes.    Scott Morton, who served in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division from May 2011 to December 2012, said that consulting is important to her research and teaching, and that she only takes on clients when she thinks a company isn\u2019t violating antitrust laws. She declined to give details about her work.    Amazon confirmed Scott Morton is working for the company but declined further comment. Apple didn\u2019t respond to a request seeking comment.    George DeMartino, a professor at the University of Denver who researches ethics in economics, said Scott Morton should have disclosed her work for Amazon and Apple in the papers. Economists are supposed to disclose real and potential conflicts that might influence their work, according to American Economic Association principles, he said.    \u201cProfessionals have a duty to maintain trust, which as we now know is a fragile thing,\u201d said DeMartino, who\u2019s part of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies. \u201cThat requires disclosing any actual conflict of interest or any entanglement that might reasonably be interpreted by others as a conflict,\u201d said DeMartino, who emphasized that he isn\u2019t an antitrust specialist and added that he wasn\u2019t criticizing Scott Morton\u2019s integrity.    Conflicts are rife in the antitrust field, said Gene Kimmelman, a senior adviser at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit that advocates for tougher antitrust enforcement, and a former chief counsel at the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust unit. His group worked with Scott Morton on the Google and Facebook reports, which were funded by a research grant from the Omidyar Network, a philanthropic organisation co-founded by Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay Inc.    A spokesperson for the Omidyar Network declined to comment on whether Scott Morton should have disclosed her consulting work.    Kimmelman strongly defended Scott Morton, saying in an email that she disclosed her work for Amazon and Apple to him. \u201cI wish all antitrust economists and lawyers had the level of integrity and consistency in analysis she has demonstrated over and over again.\u201d    Kimmelman said he had to hire an outside lawyer to navigate potential conflicts among about 10 advisers that he asked to help produce the Facebook and Google studies, as well as others on Apple and Amazon. Most of them had some of kind of conflict, he said.    \u201cPart of the game is to hire them to prevent your opponents from being able to hire them,\u201d Kimmelman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a large investment that can pay off enormously.\u201d    Economists are among the most important, and expensive, hires for companies facing antitrust inquiries by the government. Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley and who, like Scott Morton, had been a chief economist with the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, consults for Google. Shapiro said he discloses this whenever he speaks or writes.    Google has been a prolific backer of economists, according to one study that identified 330 research papers published between 2005 and 2017 that Google supported directly or indirectly. Recipients didn\u2019t disclose the funding source in 65% of cases, the report said.    Still, Scott Morton\u2019s decision to work for Amazon and Apple stands out because she has been a high-profile advocate for a more aggressive antitrust approach to tech companies, appearing on panel discussions, testifying before Congress, and speaking for quotation to news media, including Bloomberg News.    Last year, Scott Morton, whose name appears on the roster of antitrust consultants at Boston-based Charles River Associates, co-authored a report by the University of Chicago on the immense power of tech platforms.    One of the main criticisms against Amazon is that it operates an online marketplace used by third-party sellers while it also competes against those vendors, a situation sometimes described as a \u2018player-umpire\u2019 conflict. The company founded by Jeff Bezos argues that its platform is no different than brick-and-mortar supermarkets offering products with in-house labels alongside brand-name merchandise.    Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, argues that Amazon crushes small companies by copying products sold on its marketplace and selling them under its AmazonBasics line.    \u201cGiant tech companies have too much power,\u201d Warren tweeted in April 2019. \u201cMy plan to #BreakUpBigTech prevents corporations like Amazon from knocking out the rest of the competition. You can be an umpire, or you can be a player \u2013 but you can\u2019t be both.\u201d    Scott Morton retweeted the video clip and said, \u201cThis is the most articulate explanation of this Amazon theory of harm I have heard so far.\u201d She has since deleted that tweet. She said she regularly deletes old tweets.    \u201cHer description of what made her upset about Amazon was so good that you just understood it and she did it in 15 seconds or something like that,\u201d Scott Morton said about Warren. \u201cI was just in awe of her ability to communicate.\u201d    At a Center for Economic Policy Research discussion last month, Scott Morton said companies that act as both umpire and player become a problem \u201cwhen the owner of the platform says, \u2018I don\u2019t want more competition and substitutes. I\u2019m just going to cut this party off\u2019.\u201d    About an hour into the discussion, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of work for Apple and I\u2019m currently working for Amazon.\u201d    The Google and Facebook papers that Scott Morton wrote argue for antitrust action against both, but are silent on potential antitrust harms posed by Apple and Amazon.    The Google paper argues that Google\u2019s power is unique. Advertisers can choose to buy space on Facebook or Amazon, or to go through Google to reach other publishers. But newspapers and other publishers have little choice but to go through Google\u2019s advertising technology. It\u2019s been able to use that power to harm advertisers and publishers, according to the paper.    \u201cMy job is not to take down technology companies,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cMy job is to understand markets and try to figure out when they\u2019re working and when they\u2019re not.\u201d \u2013 Bloomberg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42637863322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D4-D9P1-F07F-830H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TheStar.com.my</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>YALE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The news comes as the company also announced that it recently completed a seven-minute drive on a closed course without a single human in the truck \u2014 as seen on this GoPro footage.</p><p><br/> \u201cIf you need a person in the vehicle, you\u2019re not solving the problem,\u201d co-founder and CEO Stegan Seltz-Axmacher told TechCrunch on a call prior to the announcement. \u201cThere are quite a number of places where right now you can pilot unmanned vehicles on the road. The reason people haven\u2019t done unmanned testing isn\u2019t because of regulation. That\u2019s an easy excuse.\u201d<br/> Of course, Starsky\u2019s hardly alone in its goal of automating the banal and often dangerous job of long-haul trucking. Earlier this week, Uber announced that it had begun cargo hauls in Arizona, using a combination of humans and automation. And last month, Embark, a startup found in 2016, revealed that it had completed a coast to coast trip from Los Angeles to Florida with a driver in the back seat.<br/> But Seltz-Axmacher says he believes that the big names, at least, aren\u2019t nearly as focused on full-autonomy as Starsky.<br/> \u201cNone of the big companies really care about this, all that much,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe big OEMs seem to be doing just enough to keep their shareholders from panicking. The big tech companies don\u2019t seem to really care about trucks. Uber, for example, has at least 50 times the size of our tech team, and they just started hauling freight with their self-driving trucks. We started doing that in April of last year. They\u2019re either incompetent or this doesn\u2019t matter. My guess would be the latter.\u201d<br/> The company\u2019s certainly got the ambitions to match the big check Shasta and co. recently cut. It plans to start real-world deliveries before the end of the year, according to Seltz-Axmacher. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN654514620180309</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RV3-YM81-J9XT-P2FY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"328\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 9, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp; FORECASTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001503</classCode><className>ROBOTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001561</classCode><className>SHAREHOLDERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI2QjYxNjkwMTkzNDhFRUExNjlFRjVFRUU3NDhBQkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E</classCode><className>Shareholders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DI5Y</classCode><className>AUTONOMOUS MOTOR VEHICLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000905</classCode><className>INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001503</classCode><className>ROBOTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N484000CC</classCode><className>TRUCKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DN5F</classCode><className>ON DEMAND SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIJV</classCode><className>AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS118</classCode><className>ARIZONA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Shoes of Prey was the result. Old-fashioned shoemakers in shops are disappearing in Australia. Internet shoesellers are replacing them. Mr Fox's firm goes one step further: it allows customers to design and order their own bespoke shoes online. </p><p>It wastes no time wooing men. \"We figured women are more passionate about shoes,\" says Mr Fox. Investors from America offered funds, some on condition that Shoes of Prey shift its base from Sydney to Silicon Valley. But Mr Fox and his friends refused to move. That decision appears to have done the firm no harm. It has sold more than 20,000 pairs of shoes, as far afield as France, Japan and America, and predicts that its revenue this year will be three times what it was in 2012.</p><p>A new report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), a professional-services firm, suggests that Australia could start a lot more businesses like Shoes of Prey. It predicts that online and high-tech start-ups could account for 4% of GDP and 540,000 jobs by 2033, up from 0.1% of GDP and 9,500 jobs today. The report is a reminder that Australia's long boom selling minerals to China will not last for ever. It offers signposts as to how the country might shift from mining coal to mining data. </p><p>Australia has about 1,500 tech start-ups, mostly in Sydney and Melbourne. About three-quarters are involved in media or telecoms, a small part of the economy. Yet vast untapped opportunities await in health care, an industry that will surge as the nation ages. And although there are only 23m Australians, communications technologies (such as Wi-Fi, which was partly invented in Australia) allow local firms to reach a global market. </p><p>Australia's regulatory environment for entrepreneurs is friendly, and the country is admirably open to skilled immigration. But PwC frets that \"fear of failure\" is more common in Australia than in America or Canada, and this could be holding it back. </p><p>Some Australian entrepreneurs think the sky is bluer in California. Anthony Goldbloom founded Kaggle, a firm that matches data scientists with companies, in Melbourne in 2010. He moved it to Silicon Valley the next year. Mr Goldbloom felt \"a vague sense of guilt\" about staying in Australia when the odds were stacked against building a big tech business there. Other Australian start-ups want the best of both worlds. 99designs, a marketplace for designers that was also founded in Melbourne, opened a San Francisco office in 2010 to be closer to customers, marketing talent and venture capital. However, it keeps its developers in Melbourne, where they are less likely to be poached.</p><p>Shoes of Prey somehow manages to keep the Bay Area at bay. Mr Fox and his partners wanted to stay in Sydney to draw on familiar tech networks. China, where they make their shoes, and Japan, where some of their 35 employees work, lie in similar time zones to Sydney. Of the nine investors who put in $3m between them last year, the two from Silicon Valley imposed no pressure to relocate there. It perhaps helped that one of them, Bill Tai, a Valley-based tech investor, can keep an eye on things during his regular visits Down Under as a kite-surfer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Design your own walkabout</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-023ML1D</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:588K-KVB1-DY2R-202P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"541\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Founders that go through Y Combinator have to remain passionate about their idea without letting controversial topics like regulation[4] overwhelm them, Seibel said. Click here for more BI Prime stories[5]. With the tech industry under the microscope, Silicon Valley's young startups are caught in the middle of contentious debates about privacy, regulation, and accountability. </p><p>Startup accelerator Y Combinator runs a founder showcase, called Demo Day[6], which is something of a Silicon Valley legend[7]. This year, the two-day event will run from August 19 to 20 in San Francisco where entrepreneurs at the end of the 3-month program will pitch some of the Valley's biggest investors for funding for their startups. It's a coveted moment for techies chasing the Silicon Valley dream, and an opportunity to shine in front of a friendly crowd. Outside the confines of Silicon Valley however, the startups will face a much more skeptical audience. And Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel says startups need to be ready for it. For a startup pitching an idea for a game-changing tech product, the task is much trickier today, when tech has become a bad word for a lot of people, Seibel told Business Insider in an interview. \"In this age, where I think tech is getting more skepticism, which is legit, you have to make sure you're not letting that splash on to your startup and get you down,\" Seibel said. Read More: Silicon Valley's most famous startup accelerator has a lot of participants who have already done the program. Tech founders share why they rejoined Y Combinator even after launching successful startups.[8] Outside of Silicon Valley, Seibel has noticed people start to refer to startups with the same language they used to describe larger tech companies like Google[9] and Facebook[10], both of which are facing significant scrutiny from users and lawmakers alike.  At one time, a comparison to Google would have been the ultimate complement. Today, it's a less-than-ideal comparison for founders just starting out. \"Sometimes in the popular culture it's like, it's weird to me, but I think it's very normal to lump Google, Facebook, and then all the startups you've ever heard of. I would hope that we could separate them out a little,\" Seibel said. One of the biggest differences, according to Seibel, is the standards founders are held to by the general public and investors. Those expectations tend to remain the same whether a founder is running a four-person team or a 50,000-person team, but Seibel argues that shouldn't be the case. \"It feels like Google and startups should be a closer comparison than Exxon Mobil and startups, but in reality Google is a lot closer to Exxon Mobile than it is to startups,\" Seibel said. Although Google and Facebook started out as four-person teams themselves, both tech giants have come under scrutiny for a host of privacy and anti-competitive concerns. In July, the US Federal Trade Commission hit Facebook with a $5 billion penalty[11] over its handling of user data. And Google has been fined billions of dollars in Europe because of its business practices, and is facing an antitrust investigation in the US by the Department of Justice.[12] For companies like Google and Facebook, once revered as paragons of business success and innovation, the loss of public goodwill has come as a stunning and humbling blow. And for young startup entrepreneurs who grew up associating Google with its erstwhile \"Don't be evil\" motto, the change in perception is one more variable to plan for and learn from while building a company. Many entrepreneurs may dream of achieving even a fraction of the companies' success, but Seibel believes that founders need to hold themselves to a higher standard to avoid the same pitfalls. \"Honestly, maybe the standards should have been higher for those bigger companies back then,\" Seibel said. \"Startups are far more of a faith-based initiative. If you're not in the right headspace, it can really screw you up. You have to really be the biggest fan of your startup to make it work.\" NOW WATCH: Jeff Bezos is worth over $160 billion \u2014 here's how the world's richest man makes and spends his money[13]See Also: This tech VC is based in Singapore, not Silicon Valley.

The loans are awarded according to the amount of business the merchants do on the app and are serviced through daily deductions.</p><p>Since its launch this year, the uptake has been \u201camazing\u201d, says 37-year-old Mr Grover, who previously worked at American Express and Grofers, an Indian online grocery delivery service.</p><p>\u201cWe want to be seen as the digital bank for the merchant,\u201d he says, \u201cWe have applied [to be] a non-banking financial company and we should be getting our licence in 2019 or early 2020.\u201d</p><p>It is testament to India\u2019s fast-growing payments market that BharatPe, which by some estimates is valued at over $225m and backed by US venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, has been able to rack up 1.8m merchants on the app while in competition with some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, including Amazon and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/085b1a45-6c58-4f62-b923-047085e89fa0\"> Alibaba</url>, which backs Indian start-up Paytm. Led by the charismatic entrepreneur Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Paytm has become one of India\u2019s most valuable start-ups which is branching out from payments into banking and has launched a credit card.</p><p>Though Paytm and Walmart\u2019s PhonePe dominate Indian digital payments with a 70 per cent market share based on app installations, according to research firm Kalagato, smaller players like BharatPe are flourishing because the sector is very underserved. The Reserve Bank of India estimates that the number of online payments will jump from the current 100m to 300m over the next three years.</p><p>India has become a central battleground for foreign companies who see the country as an important source of long-term growth. US-listed payments company PayPal described India as \u201ccritically important\u201d and WhatsApp is poised to launch its first payments service imminently.</p><p>\u201cThe market is too big and diverse for classic oligarchic set-ups. It\u2019s a space for multiple people to exist at least in the short to medium term while the landscape formalises,\u201d says Vivek Belgavi, fintech analyst at PwC India.</p><p>The nascent industry has been a source of optimism against a backdrop of economic gloom.</p><p>PhonePe, the payments app owned by India\u2019s largest ecommerce group <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f1d0640e-dd94-4093-9e63-4c94457c33a9\"> Flipkart</url>, is in the process of expanding aggressively with the dream of becoming as ubiquitous as China\u2019s WeChat, an app used for everything from chatting to banking to gaming.</p><p>\u201cAt this point we have 75 mini-apps on the platform,\u201d says Sameer Nigam, PhonePe founder and chief executive, \u201cWe aspire to be as much of a daily habit in people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p><p>PhonePe has emerged as a bright spot for Walmart in India, which has had to jump New Delhi\u2019s regulatory hurdles in the ecommerce space after buying Flipkart for $16bn in 2018. The app has rolled out financial services including digital gold and mutual funds, and has plans to launch more.</p><p>To fuel PhonePe\u2019s expansion, Mr Nigam is in the process of raising $1bn, which puts the value of PhonePe at $7bn, according to Morgan Stanley in a September report citing the company\u2019s potential beyond payments.</p><p>\u201cWhether the Flipkart board, which is 100 per cent owner of PhonePe today, capitalises us directly or whether we spin off is the conversation that is happening,\u201d says Mr Nigam, \u201cBut we have a firm commitment that we\u2019ll get the capital.\u201d</p><p>New Delhi\u2019s push for the adoption of digital payments has helped the sector take off.</p><p>\u201cThe regulations today are forcing people to use digital,\u201d says Arnav Gupta, digital analyst at Forrester, a market research company, citing a law that penalises cash transactions over Rs200,000 in a single day.</p><p>Financial technology groups have been hit with increasingly tight regulations that have slowed expansion plans, including new data localisation rules.</p><p>Still, that has not damped the enthusiasm of digital payments companies in India. Mr Grover has been on a hiring spree to build on BharatPe\u2019s success.</p><p>\u201cThe revelation for us is that these people are very happy to adopt technology as long as it benefits them,\u201d he says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-8288123e8def11e9b8cb26a9caa9d67b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3Y-8TM1-DXP9-9151-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><timeReceived>1:06 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 23, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00023A6</classCode><className>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004LM4</classCode><className>SEQUOIA CAPITAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0008UMH</classCode><className>RESERVE BANK OF INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That might seem like a weird question to ask, in an age when Silicon Valley ventures are hot commodities and money and talent is flooding into machine learning companies. But, in fact, Americans don't start businesses like they used to.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some of this decline has come from the decline of small businesses. When national chains like Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. can come to town and muscle out the competition, there's not much point in opening a mom-and-pop shop. Online retailers like Amazon.com Inc. just compound the effect. Research indicates that this has been responsible for much of the overall decline in entrepreneurship.</p><p>That's worrisome because small business was traditionally one of the main gateways to the middle class. Without the option of starting a corner store, Americans without high skills or advanced degrees will find it that much harder to maintain comfortable lifestyles. Instead, many will have to seek jobs from large corporations, depriving them of personal autonomy and possibly driving down wages due to the increased competition for jobs.</p><p>This is an old and wellknown problem. The decline in business formation in the retail and service sectors has been happening since the 1980s, even though the U.S. government has enacted a policies to counteract the trend. More initiatives to put the government's thumb on the scale in favour of small businesses would probably be a good thing, but the decline in new retail businesses isn't an acute crisis.</p><p>More worrying is the decline in high-tech business formation. Tech businesses tend to be high-growth businesses that employ lots of people. That same demand for labour also probably helps to drive up wages. And perhaps most important for the long term, technology startups are important for productivity growth.</p><p>Innovation is at the core of what tech startups do. They don't necessarily do original science, but they take scientific findings and new technologies and combine them with creative new business models. That results in either better or cheaper versions of existing goods or entirely new goods that people didn't even realize they would want. Newer, better and cheaper products raise the overall standard of living in the economy.</p><p>So it's disturbing that high-technology startups have also been getting rarer.</p><p>Chris Canipe of the website Axios notes that startup formation has barely ticked up in the last few years. While it's possible that hightech companies are bucking the overall trend, it seems unlikely.</p><p>So why are so few hightechnology companies being formed in the U.S.? There are a number of possible explanations. The boom in high-tech activity in the 1990s might have been a one-time bubble, or a temporary burst of activity in response to the invention and expansion of the internet. It's possible that the U.S.'s aging population might result in fewer founders and hightech workers. An extremely pessimistic possibility is that there might simply be fewer new technologies and ideas to exploit.</p><p>But it's also possible that the high-tech sector is becoming dominated by a few big players, leaving less room for innovators to break in. Tech titans like Amazon, Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft have grown to staggering size.</p><p>These companies may be such powerhouses that entrepreneurs don't find it worth their while to enter the market, because they'll just get out-competed.</p><p>If Alphabet et al. are actually doing their own innovation, then this isn't that big of a problem. But if it's merely the threat of bigcompany competition keeping tech entrepreneurs out of the market, the picture looks worse.</p><p>Big tech companies might be acting like Walmart and Target, but muscling out tech startups rather than momand-pop stores. But unlike the retail sector, competition in the innovation space might sometimes leave new ideas unexploited.</p><p>The source of the decline in startup dynamism isn't yet known. But if the tech sector is getting too concentrated, regulators might take a second look at options to reduce the dominance of the big players. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

They would like to list here, as listing in Hong Kong is recognised as good for promoting their businesses in international markets,\" Stephen Chan Yiu-kwong, a partner at US-based law firm Dechert, said in Hong Kong. </p><p>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, which operates Asia's third-largest stock market, launched its biggest listing reform in 25 years on Monday. It now allows technology companies with dual-class shareholding structures, as well as biotechnology companies with no revenue, to list in the city. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2144085/several-enquiries-no-applications-day-1-hong-kongs-new-listing\">Several enquiries but no applications on Day 1 of Hong Kong's new listing rules because of Labour Day break</url></p><p>The GEM is the HKEX's second board. Previously called the Growth Enterprise Market, it does not require companies to have a profit record, but they need a combined cash flow of HK$30 million (US$3.82 million) in the two years leading up to their listing. The HKEX's main board is for bigger companies and requires them to have a combined profit of HK$50 million in the three years leading up to their listing. </p><p>In another move that is expected to attract more technology companies to list in Hong Kong, the HKEX signed an agreement with National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ) in Beijing two weeks ago. NEEQ was started in 2012 to help fund innovative start-ups as mainland China's third exchange after Shanghai and Shenzhen.\u00a0By the end of last year, 11,600 companies had signed up to trade on it; it has raised 400 billion yuan (US$63.06 billion) since its inception.\u00a0  </p><p>e agreement will enhance the sharing of information and cooperation between the two exchanges. </p><p>\"The agreement signed between the HKEX and NEEQ has paved the way for companies now trading on the new third board to list with the HKEX,\" said Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak, founding partner of Oriental Patron Financial Group. </p><p>\"Mainland rules require that new third board companies must delist from the board before they can apply for new listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen, while the HKEX can accept their dual listing in both Beijing and Hong Kong,\" he said, adding that this puts the HKEX in a better position than the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scmp.com/business/money/markets-investing/article/2143673/father-red-chips-china-depository-receipts-will\">'Father of red chips': China depository receipts will limit secondary listings in Hong Kong by big tech firms</url></p><p>Chan also said that while many of the start-ups traded on the new third board might not have big enough profits to meet the requirements of the main board, they could qualify to listed on Hong Kong's GEM. Biotechnology companies could also meet the Hong Kong main board's listing requirements after Monday's reform, which allows large biotechnology companies without revenue but valued at HK$1.5 billion at the time of flotation to list. </p><p>Mainland rules require that new third board companies must delist from the board before they can apply for new listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen, while the HKEX can accept their dual listing in both Beijing and Hong Kong</p><p>Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak, founding partner, Oriental Patron Financial Group </p><p>Gary Cheung, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, said NEEQ companies would like to list in Hong Kong for its more flexible listing requirements and quicker approval process. </p><p>\"The companies that want to list in the mainland markets have to wait for months, or even years, to get an approval from the China Securities and Regulatory Commission. Although the CSRC has quickly approved some individual cases recently, the fast track is not for all companies. Many technology companies would thus like an IPO with the HKEX,\" said Cheung. </p><p>\"The new third board companies that want to target international investors and raise international funding will also like to list in Hong Kong.\u00a0This will become a major reason for technology companies to list with the HKEX. But the investors who want to invest in these companies need to\u00a0understand that these start-ups have high failure ratios. They need to understand the risks of investing in the sector,\" said Cheung. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2018. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

hindering the growth of startups here, according to an international survey of the sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report found that 65pc of investors in Ireland are concerned that policy is often designed to focus on big tech companies and can inadvertently hinder startups.</p><p>Report author Lenard Koschwitz of Brussels-based consultancy Allied for Startups, which carried out the survey, said the results showed that \"it is important that the Irish Government demonstrates more innovative thinking to ensure Ireland does not fall behind other tech centres\".</p><p>The report - entitled 'The Impact of Regulation on the Tech Sector' - sought the views of technology investors across Europe, including Ireland, with regard to regulation and policy decisions that impact development of the sector.</p><p>It found, in particular, that tech investors in Ireland are highly conscious and aware of the regulatory environment and that this can have a huge impact on their decision to invest or not.</p><p>\"Ireland is a good place to do business and the state agencies do excellent work to support startups,\" said Koschwitz. \"However, an increasing list of regulation coming from the EU and issues like housing and living costs are a major concern and have the potential to prevent investment in Irish startups.\"</p><p>It also found that 88pc of tech investors in Ireland believed that more could be done by Government to create an environment where tech startups could thrive, while 76pc of Irish-based investors agreed that more stability in policy and regulation would lead to a better environment for investing.</p><p>\"As the report has shown, there is a big concern amongst Irish and European investors that policy and regulation designed for specific companies could inadvertently hurt startups,\" said Koschwitz.</p><p>\"This is a trend that is not restricted to Ireland but one which all governments need to step back and consider the impact regulation will have on the whole tech sector,\" he said.</p><p>Koschwitz said that 65pc of those surveyed had said that making tech companies liable for specific online activity could be damaging for tech businesses of all sizes, but particularly so for startups and smaller companies.</p><p>\"The proposed digital tax is also seen as likely to be a significant burden on small businesses, and would be harmful for the long-term prospects of the local market - 88pc believe a digital tax on turnover could negatively impact investment in tech businesses and startups in Ireland and 71pc think a digital tax could make it harder for startups and scaleups to succeed,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The MSME sector, which hitherto is grappling with various issues such as inadequate finances, regulatory bottlenecks, infrastructural deficiency and outdated technology, has survived demonetization and GST implementation and is now gearing up to tide over the Covid-19 crisis. The pandemic is a watershed moment for the MSME sector and has made it imperative for the MSME businesses to digitally re-orient their workplaces, re-imagine their business practices and identify the right trajectory for growth, especially during the lockdowns.</p><p>A survey conducted by Endurance International Group, an IT services company specialized in web hosting, revealed that 30 per cent of MSMEs have started a business website or engaged in e-commerce since the lockdown and more than 50 per cent of the MSMEs adopted video conferencing tools and WhatsApp to ensure business continuity. Another notable example is an excellent collaboration between Mother Dairy and IBM which enabled 500 employees of Mother Dairy to work from home by utilizing a virtual computing environment and Mother Dairy's data centre.</p><p>I am sure, technological upgradation was on the to-do list for most MSMEs, but the Covid-19 pandemic made it a top priority item, for virtually every MSME. In this critical scenario, the MSMEs would have to quickly transform to an online business model and embrace digital technology in key areas such as managing inventory, undertaking sales and marketing, maintaining accounts and pushing business growth with optimal costs.</p><p>MSMEs will have to adopt technology with digital-oriented solutions for listing on e-commerce portals, gaining customers, increasing revenues and getting swift access to digital payments. MSMEs will have to look for new supply chains, innovative delivery mechanisms, and the immediate objective should be to tide through the crisis as opposed to increasing revenues.</p><p>Further, since more foreign players are looking to shift their base to India, MSMEs need to adopt best global practices and manufacture products that are internationally competitive. Promoting innovation is crucial to achieving skill upgradation and developing indigenous technological know-how. It is notable that the Government of India (GOI) has launched MSME Ideas Portal ideas.msme.gov.in, an MSME bank of schemes, ideas, innovation and research, where individuals can upload their ideas, innovations and researches relating to MSME sector. The MSME portal also facilitates inflow of venture capital and foreign collaboration.</p><p>No doubt, with the aid of technology, Indian MSMEs would go a long way in becoming globally competitive, productive and efficient. Timely guidance toward achieving technological upgradation is another important aspect.</p><p>Many steps are already in place towards achieving this objective - for instance, the Global Bharat program, exclusive for MSME businesses, launched by SAP enables Indian MSMEs to become globally competitive by equipping them with digital technologies, with its three-fold objective - access to the global marketplace, digital skilling initiatives and digitally transforming business. Further, Zoho has collaborated with NASSCOM Foundation for Big Tech program where non-profit businesses are provided with necessary technology tools.</p><p>The GOI is also lending its helping hand - for instance, the Reserve Bank of India approved e-KYC norms would help MSMEs to avail instant credit and unlock their true potential. Needless to mention, this is in addition to the Atmanirbhar Bharat reforms announced by the GOI which include Rs 3 lakh crore collateral-free loans, Rs 20,000-crore subordinate debt, Rs 50,000 crore equity infusion and revised definition of MSMEs, among others.</p><p>Adopting digital technology provides the best opportunity for MSMEs to cement their position in the Indian economy and there has never been a better time for the MSMEs to use it and make themselves globally competitive.</p><p>The role of startups in pushing the MSMEs to greater heights cannot be downplayed. Startups, beaming with technologies, have the potential to disrupt markets, and collaboration between startups and MSMEs can be seen as a game-changer. It is important that innovation by MSMEs needs to go in every stage - procuring raw materials and man-power, and undertaking manufacturing and digital marketing. Advanced tools such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain technology can be effectively implemented to refurbish their business models. To the extent feasible, efforts should be made by MSMEs to move off-line activities to an omnichannel platform.</p><p>Arvind Sharma is Partner at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas &amp; Co.

Morse preaches the message that having whiz-bang technology is not enough reason to start a company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You have to have a valuable solution people will pay money for,\" said Morse, managing director of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center, which trains techies in entrepreneurial realities. \"Of the couple of thousand of MIT spinoff companies that started with only engineers, 80 percent failed. Of those with one business person on the founding team, 80 percent were successful.\"</p><p>Morse, an MIT grad, has helped launch six high-tech startups, including 3Com Corp. and Aspen Technology. He's a second-generation entrepreneur: His father Richard applied vacuum packaging technology he developed for the atomic bomb to orange juice processing. The result: Minute Maid Orange Juice.</p><p>Ken Morse spoke Thursday before an audience of entrepreneurs and investors gathered for a fundraising conference sponsored by the Central Florida Innovation Corp. Between eight-minute presentations by hopeful startups searching for capital, Morse told participants that in his opinion, there's no shortage of money, just a shortage of excellent entrepreneurs.</p><p>\"They're weird, twitching, high-energy, annoying people,\" Morse said of the entrepreneurial hopefuls he works with at the MIT Center. \"It's lovely.\"</p><p>Before his speech, Morse spoke to reporters about his view on global tech hot spots, Florida's strengths and weaknesses and why an entrepreneur should never brag about his golf handicap.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Q: How do you decide which geniuses at MIT will be successful entrepreneurs?</p><p>A: In our admissions process, on both the undergraduate and graduate level, we don't only look for brains. We also focus on leadership and team sports. Sports is the biggest differentiator. When you look at successful CEOs, especially women, all of them have been involved in team sports in high school. They know how to win and how to lose.</p><p>We used to take all the 800s (the highest score on each the math and verbal SATs). But we learned that's not enough. They have to be tech savvy, but not a techie. They have to have leadership. And we screen for ethics and honesty.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Q: When you think of entrepreneurial hot spots, where would you put Florida?</p><p>A: Over the last five years, I've visited technology hot spots around the world. These are places with the potential to create the critical mass needed to become the next technology center.</p><p>For years there was just Route 128 (surrounding Boston) and Silicon Valley. But I've watched Austin, Seattle and San Diego emerge.</p><p>I've seen Singapore try, though there's a lot less there than meets the eye. I've watched Munich; Cambridge, U.K.; and Ireland.</p><p>What made possible their success or not? Almost always business was supported by a savvy government that doesn't get in the way, that exhibits dependable, consistent leadership over 20 years, because that's how long it takes to develop these places.</p><p>The area around MIT, Kendall Square, has become the epicenter of the biotech industry. And in the later 1960s or early 1970s, the city of Cambridge established the most stringent regulations in the world for biotech. Most people felt they were crazy and they'd drive business away. What happened was the opposite. People who were thinking of setting up companies knew the rules were set up and would not change. So I believe appropriate regulation is key to establishing tech hot spots.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Q: Where is Florida in that equation?</p><p>A: I don't think people think of or know about Florida companies.</p><p>Nobody thinks NASA will do anything, because they've never been able to commercialize their technology.</p><p>What the government can do is anything and everything it can to get some big tech-based companies to move here.</p><p>You've got the cheapest airport on the planet here in Orlando. And the lousiest airport in the world in Miami, which no one seems interested in improving. But all companies in the world already meet in Orlando. I don't know about your other assets, like electric power, but you do have the world's cheapest airport.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Q: Do government incentives work?</p><p>A: They certainly do. People do care about taxes, though it's not the No. 1 driver. Just look at Massachusetts and California, where taxes are high, though we are reducing capital gains taxes in Massachusetts.</p><p>It's about efficient, predictable services. You should benchmark against the best. How long does it take to build a building in Florida? In Silicon Valley, you can go from raw land to a building ready for occupancy in nine or 10 months.</p><p>In Massachusetts, it's 18 months. And that's not because of snow, it's because of a lousy, inefficient, featherbedded, entrenched government. Find out if that's the kind of government you've got.</p><p>In Massachusetts, we're changing that, and the governor is preapproving land all over the state for biotech development. But that's because North Carolina is kicking our butt.</p><p>But Raleigh/Research Triangle area is boring. There's no interesting research going on. It's a cheap place to do manufacturing, but they're not creating anything.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Q: Any other thoughts on obstacles Florida faces as it tries to encourage tech development?</p><p>A: I worry when I hear about too many low golf handicaps here. That means people spend too much time on the golf course. People don't invest in companies where the guy works 40 hours a week. That's a lifestyle company, not one that will return the 10 to 20 to 30 percent return a venture capital investor wants.</p><p>I want a wild-eyed, workaholic maniac. They're usually geniuses and first-generation immigrants, not good old boys with single-digit handicaps.</p><p>The last time I played golf was in college.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Q: Can entrepreneurs still find investors?</p><p>A: If there are good ideas and good teams, there are good deals.

Digital Economy (Coadec), which lambasts the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) \"ignorant one-size-fits-all approach to tech acquisitions, investment and mergers\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The letter to Rishi Sunak, the new chancellor, comes weeks after the CMA staged an eleventh-hour intervention into <url

stake in Deliveroo.</p><p>A more aggressive CMA approach to technology industry deals comes amid a review of how big tech is policed in Britain after Brexit.</p><p>The rise of digital behemoths has created significant benefits for consumers but is posing policy headaches for regulators anxious about their vast influence over individuals' lives.</p><p>Investors in the UK tech sector have begun to express alarm that the CMA could disincentivise innovation in the UK economy by blocking deals which involve only minority shareholdings in companies, or using hypothetical scenarios about future market entrants to justify an interventionist approach.</p><p>Referring to a review conducted last year by Jason Furman, an academic, Mr Hallas said it had identified the risk that \"'enforcement can be slow and unpredictable, which is even more costly than normal in rapidly evolving technology markets\".</p><p>\"The CMA now risks making the very mistake that the review identified - killing British companies with lengthy investigations whilst global digital markets move on around them,\" he said.</p><p>\"There must be a more appropriate approach than stifling British companies of investment whilst their global competitors grow.</p><p>\"Lengthy investigations risk not only sending the wrong message about the UK to global investors but also result in anti-competitive outcomes.\"</p><p>A report published this week by Allen &amp; Overy, the law firm, said the CMA had become the world's most aggressive anti-trust watchdog, based on the proportion of deals that it had sought to block.</p><p>Mr Hallas told the chancellor that the track record of Britain's tech sector at attracting investment - $13.2bn in venture capital last year - had been \"driven by a huge pool of diverse talent, strong investor networks, and forward-thinking regulators that allow innovators to challenge incumbents\".</p><p>He added that \"interventions from the CMA have posed a real concern, both for scaling companies seeking to grow in global markets and for the investors backing them\".</p><p>\"These interventions not only create investor uncertainty but also starve scaling companies of capital at the very moment they need it most,\" he said.</p><p>Deliveroo and Amazon have sought to reject the CMA's basis for launching a Phase 2 or in-depth inquiry into their deal, arguing that the watchdog had been guilty of failing to understand the UK food delivery market.</p><p>The CMA has said that by allowing Amazon to lead a $575m (\u00a3440m) fundraising by the UK tech company, it could diminish competition by removing the possibility of the internet behemoth returning to the market.</p><p>The companies' joint submission argued, however, that Amazon's grocery delivery service competes with those of Sainsbury's and Tesco while Deliveroo's is more akin to that of Uber Eats.</p><p>The two companies also disputed the CMA's suggestion that Amazon would exert \"material influence\" over Deliveroo by virtue of its planned investment, which would equate to an undisclosed minority stake in the British business.</p><p>Deliveroo is likely to need to secure alternative funding in the coming months if Amazon's investment is blocked outright.</p><p>The CMA said earlier this year: \"Our initial investigation found UK consumers could be negatively affected if the deal went ahead, as Amazon could be discouraged from re-entering a market in which there are only a small number of companies that act as the middleman between restaurants and customers, and that it could also damage competition in the emerging market for online convenience grocery delivery.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PHOTO: </emphasis></p><p><url

Subscribe here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">German software giant SAP bought experience management platform Qualtrics for $8 billion days before the unicorn s IPO, back in November of 2018. But last weekend it decided to spin out the      experience management provider to finally go public on its own. The analysts Ron Miller talked to speculated about strategic issues on the SAP side, and concluded this was more of an internal      reset combined with the financial gain from a promising offering.</p><p>Qualtrics, meanwhile, already put the Utah startup scene on the map for people around the world. Having grown strongly post-acquisition, it is now set up to be the largest IPO in state history.      Here s Alex Wilhelm with more analysis in Extra Crunch:</p><p>According to metrics from the Bessemer Cloud Index, cloud companies with growth rates of 35.5% and gross margins of 71.3% are worth around 17.3x in enterprise value compared to their annualized      revenue.</p><p>Given how close Qualtrics is to that averaged set of metrics (slightly slower growth, slightly better gross margins), the 17.3x number is probably not far from what the company can achieve when      it does go public. Doing the sums, $800 million times 17.3 is $13.8 billion, far more than what SAP paid for Qualtrics. (For you wonks out there, it s doubtful that Qualtrics has much debt,      though it will have lots of cash post-IPO; expect the company s enterprise value to be a little under its future market cap.)</p><p>So, the markets are valuing cloud companies so highly today that even after SAP had to pay a huge premium to buy Qualtrics ahead of its public offering, the company is still sharply more      valuable today after just two years of growth.</p><h>Back to the era of nation-states</h><p>The tech industry is getting broken down and reformed by national governments in ways that many of its leaders do not seem to have planned for as part of scaling to the world, whether you      consider TikTok s ever-shrinking global footprint or leading tech CEOs getting called out by Congress. When you skim through the numerous headlines on these topics this week, you ll see a very      clear message in the subtext: Every startup has to think more carefully about its place in the world these days, as a matter of survival.</p><p>Big tech crushes Q2 earnings expectations</p><p>Lawmakers argue that big tech stands to benefit from the pandemic and must be regulated</p><p>Secret documents from US antitrust probe reveal big tech s plot to control or crush the competition</p><p>Apple s App Store commission structure called into question in antitrust hearing</p><p>Zuckerberg unconvincingly feigns ignorance of data-sucking VPN scandal</p><p>In antitrust hearing, Zuckerberg admits Facebook has copied its competition</p><p>Before buying Instagram, Zuckerberg warned employees of  battle  to  dislodge  competitor</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook questioned over App Store s removal of rival screen time apps in antitrust hearing</p><p>Google s Sundar Pichai grilled over  destroying anonymity on the internet </p><p>Bezos  can t guarantee  no anti-competitive activity as Congress catches him flat-footed</p><p>Amazon s hardware business doesn t escape Congressional scrutiny</p><p>Time for TikTok:</p><p>India bans 47 apps cloning restricted Chinese services</p><p>After India and US, Japan looks to ban TikTok and other Chinese apps</p><p>Report: Microsoft in talks to buy TikTok s US business from China s ByteDance</p><p>The leading arguments for a Microsoft-TikTok tie-up ;)</p><p>And last but not least ominously, for large platforms...</p><p>Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for news</p><p>The team at remote-first enterprise startup Seeq put together this montage of some of its remote offices.</p><h>Remote work still getting big investment</h><p>This loosely defined subsector of SaaS went from being a somewhat mainstream idea within the startup world last year to being fully mainstream with the wider world due to the pandemic this      year. But publicly traded companies have been some of the biggest beneficiaries (see previous item), and the action around earlier-stage startups has been less clear. Lucas Matney and Alex      caught up with six investors who have been focused on various parts of the space to get the latest for Extra Crunch. Here s a pithy description of fundraising trends that companies are      experiencing, from Elliott Robinson, a growth-stage investor at Bessemer:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How competitive are remote-work tooling venture rounds now?</emphasis></p><p>Incredibly competitive. I think one dynamic I ve seen play out is that the basket of remote-work companies that are really high-performing right now are setting lofty price expectations well      ahead of the raise. Many of these companies didn t plan on raising in Q2/Q3, but with COVID tailwinds, they are choosing to raise at some often sight-unseen-level valuation multiples.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Are prices out of control?</emphasis></p><p>I think it depends on your definition of out of control. The reality is that many of these companies are raising money off cycle from their natural fundraising date for two reasons: One, they      are seeing once in a lifetime digital transformation and adoption of remote-work tooling solutions. And, two, so many investors have raised sizable funds during the last nine months that they      are leaning into investing in these companies   one of the few segments that will likely continue to see tailwinds as COVID cases continue to rise again in the U.S. Other traditional software      value props may face significant headwinds in a uncertain COVID world. Thus, growth equity investors are paying high multiples to get a shot at the category-defining RW app companies.</p><h>Haptics in a pandemic-stricken world</h><p>Haptics are a great sort of gee-whiz technology, but the practical future of touch-based communication is all over the place   VR devices are suddenly more interesting, touchpads less so. Devon      Powers and David Parisi are academics and authors who focus on the space, and they wrote a big guest post for TechCrunch this week that sketched out some of the ups and downs of the decades-old      concept. Here s a key excerpt:</p><p>Getting haptics right remains challenging despite more than 30 years  worth of dedicated research in the field. There is no evidence that COVID is accelerating the development of projects      already in the pipeline. The fantasy of virtual touch remains seductive, but striking the golden mean between fidelity, ergonomics and cost will continue to be a challenge that can only be met      through a protracted process of marketplace trial-and-error. And while haptics retains immense potential, it isn t a magic bullet for mending the psychological effects of physical distancing.</p><p>Curiously, one promising exception is in the replacement of touchscreens using a combination of hand-tracking and midair haptic holograms, which function as button replacements. This product      from Bristol-based company Ultraleap uses an array of speakers to project tangible soundwaves into the air, which provide resistance when pressed on, effectively replicating the feeling of      clicking a button.</p><p>Ultraleap recently announced that it would partner with the cinema advertising company CEN to equip lobby advertising displays found in movie theaters around the U.S. with touchless haptics      aimed at allowing interaction with the screen without the risks of touching one. These displays, according to Ultraleap,  will limit the spread of germs and provide safe and natural interaction      with content. </p><p>A recent study carried out by the company found that more than 80% of respondents expressed concerns over touchscreen hygiene, prompting Ultraleap to speculate that we are reaching  the end of      the [public] touchscreen era.  Rather than initiate a technological change, the pandemic has provided an opportunity to push ahead on the deployment of existing technology. Touchscreens are no      longer sites of naturalistic, creative interaction, but are now spaces of contagion to be avoided. Ultraleap s version of the future would have us touching air instead of contaminated glass.</p><h>Finding the best investors for you: The TC List and Europe surveys</h><p>Speaking of investors, TechCrunch has been busy with a few other projects to you find the right ones faster.</p><p>First, Danny Crichton has pushed a third update to The TechCrunch List, due to the ongoing flood of recommendations. In his words:  Now using more than 2,600 founder recommendations   more than      double our original dataset   we have underscored a number of the existing investors on our list as well as added 116 new investors who have been endorsed by founders as investors willing to      cut against the grain and write those critical first checks and lead venture rounds. </p><p>Check it out and filter by location, category and stage to narrow down your pitch list. If you are a founder and haven t submitted your recommendation yet, please fill out our very brief      survey. If you have questions, we put together a Frequently Asked Questions page that describes the qualifications and logistics, some of the logic behind the List and how to get in touch with      us.</p><p>Second, our editor-at-large Mike Butcher is embarking on a virtual investor survey of European countries, to help Extra Crunch provide a clearer view about what s happening in the Continent s      startup hubs in the middle of the world going crazy:</p><p>TechCrunch is embarking on a major new project to survey the venture capital investors of Europe. Over the next few weeks, we will be  zeroing-in  on Europe s major cities, from A-Z, Amsterdam      to Zurich   and many points in-between. It s part of a broader series of surveys we re doing to help founders find the right investors. For example, here is the recent survey of London.</p><p>Our survey will capture how each European startup hub is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic. We d like to know how your city s startup      scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19 and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here. Our survey will only be about investors, and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</emphasis>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you want to add, the better.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The deadline for entries is the end of next week, August 7th and you can fill it out here.</emphasis></p><p>He also wanted me to let you know that he ll resume his in-person trips as soon as allowed.

But after we got past SPAC nuances (shout-out to David Ethridge), we had a full show of good stuff,      including:</p><p>Y Combinator Demo Day is going virtual, as before, and its coming iteration will also be live. The Equity crew all agree that this is the right thing to do, and probably more fun, to boot.      And now the founders can sweat a live event, too! What fun.</p><p>Speaking of live events going digital, Disrupt is coming up. And it is going to be great. Read more here.</p><p>A group of Stanford business school students are putting together an investment vehicle to invest money into themselves, which is a good idea and something that is highly risible. Luckily,      Danny and Natasha had good things to say about the effort.</p><p>Ro raised $200 million, and any jokes that were inappropriate are Danny s fault. The company s reported $1.5 billion valuation makes the news that its competitor Hims could go public via a      SPAC all the more exciting.</p><p>I covered a neat round: $20 million for Instrumental, a super neat startup that has me hyped.</p><p>Facebook is still hunting up ways to get a better look into growing startups   this time via investments in venture capital funds.</p><p>And, finally, there were some hearings this week, you might have heard. We re working on something neat that you are going to love on just that topic, so stay tuned.</p><p>And that s Equity for this week. We are back Monday morning early, so make sure you are keeping tabs on our socials.

We highlighted it earlier in the context of the Internet of Things[1], but it is true across the board. Quick iterative cycles and fast go-to-market seem to be often prioritized over the security of a product before putting it in users' hands, with sometimes terrible consequences. Indian cab-hailing startup OLA[2] or restaurant discovery service Zomato[3] are cases in point that a poorly protected product can lend itself to being hacked regardless of a company's age or size. </p><p>'For start-ups to believe that they are too small for cyber attackers to take note of them is naive and misguided' as we already highlighted[4] in 2016. In fact, it is the dominant mindset in the entrepreneurial world which is often at odds with actual security measures being put in place early on, at both company and product level. In the immortal words of Mark Zuckerberg: 'Move fast and break things. If you are not breaking things, you are not moving fast enough'. This mentality is simply misplaced in the context of cybersecurity. Indeed, leaking the passwords and banking details of your early users can have much more serious consequences than a bug in your app or picking the wrong colour for your logo. And this is likely to get worse as regulation tightens around the world. You simply can't afford to A/B test your product's security. All the more paradoxical is that implementing security and privacy best-practices and putting the right controls in place from the start should not be that expensive or time-consuming in a context where every feature costs money and take time. But the fact is that security is rarely seen as a feature, and privacy is often cynically sacrificed on the altars of data monetization. Quite simply, the features included in the MVP will be those that users and VCs will really notice and those which will drive valuations up. But this is often more a matter of perception than proper research and it is plagued by cognitive biases on all fronts, in particular the 'imaginability' or 'availability' biases theorized by Nobel-laureate Daniel Kahneman[5]. And for now, perception amongst this community is that security and privacy won't drive sales and valuations, and therefore don't matter. Security and privacy audits in early-stage funding due-diligence are virtually non-existent, and there are simply no incentives for start-ups to take all this seriously. This is dangerously short-termist and goes against 2 clear trends: Data breaches and cyber-attacks keep happening at an alarming rate and nobody is immune as we highlighted above. Society at large is taking security and privacy more and more seriously, as demonstrated by the rise of anger against Facebook over the past few years. Politicians have jumped on that band wagon and regulation[6] is tightening worldwide. Different investors look at different horizons and ESG[7] is becoming a more and more important factor[8] for many. Security and privacy are important pillars of the social and governance dimensions and research[9] has started to emerge showing that good ESG practices support higher valuations. In the long-term, every start-up must understand that the real secret sauce is Trust: In a context of increasing levels of consumer awareness around privacy and data protection, your most valuable asset will be the trust of your customers in your product. In fact, fighting early on against the current data-driven trust deficit[10] might be your smartest bet as a new company. 'Moving fast and breaking things' has never created trust. Start-ups must build customer trust from early days by embedding sound security and privacy practices in the products and in their culture. Originally published here[11].

There are concerns Facebook \"put consumer data at risk, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, and increased the price of advertising,\" she said. \"As we continue our investigation, we will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions stifled competition and put users at risk.\" James reportedly hosted an AG meeting Monday with experts to discuss legal grounds for the Facebook investigation. The company didn't comment.</p><p>Joining New York on the Facebook probe's leadership team are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Washington, D.C.Alabama, California and Maryland didn't initially sign on. \"Free and competitive markets help ensure consumers have access to the highest quality and most cost-effective products and services,\" Arizona AG Mark Brnovich (R) said in a statement.</p><p>With Facebook's dominance comes obligation to ensure company practices aren't stifling competition, said Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro (D). Connecticut's William Tong (D) warned against prejudging outcomes, saying anticompetitive behavior by Facebook would have far-reaching consequences. Just like any citizen, the platform is innocent until proven guilty, said Curtis Hill (R) from Indiana, and consumers and the free market must be protected. \"Even the biggest of the big tech companies should be held accountable, and that's what we're seeking to do with this investigation,\" said Eric Schmitt (R) of Missouri.</p><p>The FTC has been investigating Facebook for antitrust violations. DOJ has been doing a wide-ranging investigation of the tech industry.</p><p>Policymakers should focus on specific business sectors to regulate digital platforms, Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law Senior Fellow and Policy Mark MacCarthy argued Tuesday. If a new agency polices platforms, it should be sector-specific, like the SEC or the FCC, he said: \"Democratic control of technology means an active and alert government agency with a strong mandate to protect the public interest.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBY-B861-DYRJ-0004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

That was antitrust and privacy issues,\" said Jim Hood, the Democratic Mississippi attorney general. \"One percent of the conversation, bias was discussed.\"</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- who faces a looming meeting with Trump later this week after The New York Times and others reported that he had secretly suggested recording the President and discussed recruiting Cabinet members to remove Trump from office -- was present for the meeting, as was Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who heads the Justice Department's antitrust division, the department said. Rosenstein has emphatically denied the reports.</p><p>In a statement after the meeting, the Justice Department said the group, which also included senior deputies from five other state attorneys general offices, discussed \"ways the Department and state governments can most effectively safeguard consumers using online digital platforms\" against problems of data privacy and \"consumer protection,\" which includes the question of potential bias, a spokesman said.</p><p>Attendees said breaking up the technology companies, an idea that has been promoted by Steve Bannon, a former Trump senior adviser, was not floated in the meeting. Instead, officials discussed how antitrust laws on the books could be applied to regulate the firms, and drew comparisons to landmark cases of the past, including Standard Oil and IBM. </p><p>Though Justice Department officials have concerns about potential bias at the firms, an official told CNN earlier this month, no federal investigation is known to have been opened, and attendees at Tuesday's meeting said any future probes would likely include both state and federal involvement.</p><p>\"State AGs have grappled with these issues for years,\" said Utah Attorney General Sean D. Reyes, a Republican. \"Having a federal perspective was welcome. We agreed that at the federal and state level, we are both seeking robust protection of consumers and markets through responsible regulation and disciplined enforcement.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

That was antitrust and privacy issues,\" said Jim Hood, the Democratic Mississippi attorney general. \"One percent of the conversation, bias was discussed.\"</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- who faces a looming meeting with Trump later this week after The New York Times and others reported that he had secretly suggested recording the President and discussed recruiting Cabinet members to remove Trump from office -- was present for the meeting, as was Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who heads the Justice Department's antitrust division, the department said. Rosenstein has emphatically denied the reports.</p><p>In a statement after the meeting, the Justice Department said the group, which also included senior deputies from five other state attorneys general offices, discussed \"ways the Department and state governments can most effectively safeguard consumers using online digital platforms\" against problems of data privacy and \"consumer protection,\" which includes the question of potential bias, a spokesman said.</p><p>Attendees said breaking up the technology companies, an idea that has been promoted by Steve Bannon, a former Trump senior adviser, was not floated in the meeting. Instead, officials discussed how antitrust laws on the books could be applied to regulate the firms, and drew comparisons to landmark cases of the past, including Standard Oil and IBM.</p><p>Though Justice Department officials have concerns about potential bias at the firms, an official told CNN earlier this month, no federal investigation is known to have been opened, and attendees at Tuesday's meeting said any future probes would likely include both state and federal involvement.</p><p>\"State AGs have grappled with these issues for years,\" said Utah Attorney General Sean D. Reyes, a Republican. \"Having a federal perspective was welcome. We agreed that at the federal and state level, we are both seeking robust protection of consumers and markets through responsible regulation and disciplined enforcement.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20180925attorney-generals-doj-tech-companies1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TBR-5VJ1-DY60-M326-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"508\"/><timeReceived>9:44 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 25, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Now, they're setting their sights on another target: Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> After years of federal inaction, the state watchdogs are initiating sweeping antitrust investigations against Silicon Valley's largest companies, probing whether they undermine rivals and harm consumers. Their latest salvo arrives Monday, when more than 40 attorneys general are expected to announce their plan to investigate Google, delivering a rare rebuke of the search-and-advertising giant - and its efforts to maintain that dominance - from the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The states seek to probe allegations that the tech industry stifles startups, delivers pricier or worse service for web users and siphons too much personal information, enriching their record-breaking revenue at the cost of consumer privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"The growth of these [tech] companies has outpaced our ability to regulate them in a way that enhances competition,\" said Keith Ellison, a Democratic attorney general from Minnesota who is signing on to the effort to probe Google.</p><p> \"They need to be regulated,\" he continued, \"and my view is, it's the state AG's job to do it, particularly when the federal government is not necessarily a reliable partner in the area.\"</p><p> Historically, the federal government has taken the starring role in competition matters, including investigations into potential monopolies and mergers, and such inquiries involving the tech giants are underway. But the states are potent actors in their own right, with the power to invoke local laws on antitrust and consumer-protection and to tap Washington's antitrust statutes on behalf of their residents.</p><p> When state attorneys general have banded together on a broad, bipartisan basis, they've managed to muscle major changes to other industries. They forced billions of dollars in payments from Big Tobacco to pay health claims and finance antismoking campaigns in the 1990s. Two decades later, they helped reform unfair mortgage lending practices. More recently, states have led lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies they contend are responsible for the opioid crisis.</p><p> Now, they threaten to do the same to Silicon Valley, unleashing potentially wide-ranging antitrust punishments against not only Google but all of tech's biggest players.</p><p> \"The attorneys general have found they can actually rewrite the rules for entire sectors and individual companies through these cases,\" said Rob McKenna, a former attorney general in Washington state and now a partner at the law firm Orrick. \"The attorneys general have a lot of power here to achieve regulation by litigation.\"</p><p> For years, Silicon Valley has been relatively free of regulation, particularly in Washington. President Barack Obama took a hands-off approach to encourage the industry's growth, and Congress never took serious action. But a series of scandals, including the misuse of social media during the 2016 election, thrust the industry into the political spotlight, prompting some state and federal policymakers to question whether companies had become too big, too powerful and too unchecked.</p><p> As a result, antitrust has commanded uncharacteristic political attention in recent months. President Donald Trump at times has threatened to take aim at tech giants, including Google, though his attacks often are motivated by unsubstantiated claims that the companies could hurt his election chances. Some Democratic contenders for the White House in 2020, meanwhile, have pledged to probe and potentially break up big tech if they win next November.</p><p> For months, state attorneys general similarly have been sounding off about their interest in taking on tech giants such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. They raised their voices for privacy and antitrust scrutiny during private meetings with the Department of Justice dating back to last September, The Washington Post reported at the time.</p><p> But schisms in recent months have emerged between state attorneys general and Washington's competition cops. Some state attorneys general have publicly charged that federal regulators are moving too slowly - even though their counterparts at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have said in statements they are all working cooperatively.</p><p> Sixteen states sued this summer to stop the merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, invoking federal competition law to try to thwart a telecom megadeal that the Justice Department had approved, with conditions. Outside of the tech sector, state officials have been just as active. Phil Weiser, the Democratic attorney general of Colorado, directly intervened in a health-care-companies merger the FTC approved this year to obtain more concessions for local residents.</p><p> \"The reason I believe we see so much attention on antitrust in this area is because the economy is so concentrated,\" Weiser said in a later interview.</p><p> With Google, states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, on Monday plan to focus their probe on the way the search giant amasses data and maintains its dominance, particularly in advertising, where it captured more than 38 percent of the online advertising market in 2018, according to eMarketer.</p><p> \"Online advertising is everywhere,\" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. \"This investigation is about whether that market is fair and open to all. We hope that Google will cooperate in the states' investigation.\"</p><p>Google long has been a problem in the eyes of some states. Missouri opened a competition investigation of Google in 2017, when the state attorney general's office was led by Josh Hawley, now a Republican U.S. senator. Jim Hood, the Democratic attorney general of Mississippi, has sued Google over its privacy practices. And Arizona's Republican attorney general, Mark Brnovich, last year opened his own probe into allegations that Google misused people's location data.</p><p> \"Any time you get that many attorneys general, both Democrats and Republicans, liberal and conservatives all across the ideological spectrum, agreeing that something needs to be done about Google ... it speaks volumes,\" Brnovich said in an interview about antitrust.</p><p> Adding to Google's headaches, top deputies to Paxton in Texas repeatedly have faulted the company, alleging that it stifles conservatives' speech online. Google has denied claims of deliberate political bias, and evidence supporting the allegation is scant, but Texas leaders have raised the possibility that they could probe the company for the matter.</p><p> Paxton's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the antitrust investigation, which The Post first reported last week.</p><p> \"Google's services help people every day, create more choices for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country,\" said company spokesman Jose Castaneda. \"We look forward to working with the attorneys general to answer questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"</p><p>Google is not the only tech giant to draw the interest of the states. Last week, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that she would explore whether Facebook violated competition laws because it mishandled \"consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, or increased the price of advertising.\" The investigation has the backing of attorneys general in states such as Colorado, Florida and Ohio as well as the District of Columbia.</p><p>Facebook already had been in some states' crosshairs over its privacy practices. The company's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, which improperly accessed tens of millions of Facebook users' social data, sparked a national investigation by states' attorneys general that remains underway. Regulators in D.C. have sued Facebook in court over violating local residents' privacy.</p><p> Will Castleberry, vice president for state and local policy at Facebook, said in a statement that Web users have \"multiple choices for every one of the services we provide,\" adding: \"We will work constructively with state attorneys general and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.\"</p><p> The broad nature of the states' investigation - expected to involve nearly every state's attorney general in some fashion - could easily spread far beyond Facebook and Google to include companies such as Amazon. Federal officials have said they are studying e-commerce, a market Amazon leads, adding to the possibility that states could do the same.</p><p> Antitrust experts said the states forging ahead - potentially without the federal government - risked creating legal headaches. William Kovacic, a former FTC commissioner who now teaches at George Washington University's law school, said an \"ideal world\" would involve more coordination given the potential that regulators may have to go to court to force changes at Facebook and Google.</p><p> But, he added, Silicon Valley can ill afford to dismiss the seriousness of the states' new legal assault: \"Simply put, by joining up their resources, they have the ability to bring a big case and seek significant remedies.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTX-62392990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2896F25EFDBEC1 NWBKTX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-B121-JBCN-41GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401983</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1540\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Denton Record-Chronicle<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The AGs are preparing subpoenas, called civil investigation demands, to support the inquiries, according to a report on CNBC[1]. To date, the investigation has focused on Google's advertising business. A Google spokesman had no comment on the CNBC report. </p><p>He referred MarketWatch to a blog post [2]from Kent Walker, senior vice president of global affairs in September. The post is headlined, 'Google's services create choice for consumers, and spur innovation in the U.S.' Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is leading the probe by 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, recently expressed support for expanding the investigation into Google's search and Android businesses. 'At this point, the multistate investigation is focused solely on online advertising; however, as always, the facts we discover as the investigation progresses will determine where the investigation ultimately leads,' a spokesman for the Texas attorney general, told CNBC. The deepening nature of the states' investigation illustrates the broad investigative paths taken by states and their head lawmakers to scrutinize Google, which has a market value is $835 billion. Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc.  GOOGL, 1.00%[3] GOOG, 1.04%[4] were down slightly in after-hours trading Thursday. Its size and influence, as well as that of the other three tech conglomerates under investigation \u2014 Amazon.com Inc.  AMZN, 0.08%[5] , Apple Inc.  AAPL, -0.69%[6] and Facebook Inc.  FB, -0.02%[7] \u2014 has led to several Congressional hearings and calls from leaders of both parties to slice and dice their vast operations. The U.S. Department of Justice, which is conducting its own antitrust probes of Google and Apple, has served its own subpoenas related to 'prior antitrust investigations in the United States and elsewhere,' Google revealed in a securities filing [8]this summer. See also: Are Big Tech acquisitions feeding antitrust probes?[9]  The report comes a day after federal lawmakers pressed antitrust enforcers, including Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, about their probes. Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, expressed frustration over planned acquisitions by Google. 'The hubris of the executive team to pursue an acquisition of this size,' Cicilline said, referring to its $2.1 billion bid for Fitbit[10], 'while under federal and state antitrust investigations is astonishing.'The post State AGs plan to widen probe of Google to include search, Android businesses: report[11] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[12].

Landry told SiriusXM's \"Breitbart News Daily\" show that \"all actions\" are being considered by his peers when it comes to reining-in the Silicon Valley behemoths. His comments come amid a growing, bipartisan wave of hostility against big tech in recent months, with major Democrat and Republican figures expressing concern. </p><p>A US attorney general has said \"all actions\" are on the table when it comes to curbing the power of tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Speaking to SiriusXM's \"Breitbart News Daily\" radio show[1], Jeff Landry, the attorney general for Louisiana, described a growing sense of unease among his peers regarding the size of the tech giants. \"A handful of companies have am massed a tremendous amount of data and power over the US and world economy,\" he said. \"When you talk to attorneys general around the country \u2014 irrespective of whether they're Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative \u2014 there is an instinct that something is going on, there is this instinctive feeling that something must be done with these companies, that they have become too big.\" He added that US attorneys general will be meeting potentially as early as next Monday to discuss possible antitrust regulation against big tech. \"In a couple of weeks... there's a roundtable being conducted by attorneys general in front of the FEC [Federal Election Commission] to discuss this, to discuss the harm that it's placing on consumers, whether or not it will lead to antitrust action against the companies, or whether or not we should be looking more carefully on any mergers or consolidations or buyouts by these tech companies,\" Landry said. The Republican added that history has shown that there could be the appetite to stand up to big tech companies if there is a view among voters that they have grown too powerful. \"Historically, when corporations in this country, in our free market economy, have amassed monopolistic power \u2014 power to basically control the economy \u2014 the people have stood up and said, 'Enough is enough. Something must be done.' There's been a lot of positive that has come out of government taking action in this type of matter,\" he explained.

Here's why.[2] Landry's comments come amid a growing wave of hostility towards the tech giants from major political figures across the political spectrum. Last September, the Department of Justice said former US Attorney General Jeff Sessions was open to investigating[3] whether the Silicon Valley behemoths were stifling free speech and competition, while in November, President Donald Trump said his administration was \"looking at\"[4] whether Google, Facebook, and Amazon were violating antitrust laws. Earlier this month, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren outlined a detailed agenda for breaking up the big tech firms, while in February, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led a successful campaign to stop Amazon building its HQ2 headquarters in New York. Although big tech firms have largely shied away from responding to politicians' comments directly, some are attempting to get ahead of potential new regulations, such as federal privacy laws. In a blog earlier this month setting out his manifesto for Facebook's future, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wants the company to become a \"privacy-focused platform,\" boosting end-to-end encryption and giving people more control over their history.NOW WATCH: Amazon will pay $0 in federal taxes this year \u2014 here's how the $793 billion company gets away with it[5]See Also: Mark Zuckerberg uses one

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans. The Wall Street Journal published an article Monday, States Loom as a Regulatory Threat to Tech Giants[1], examining the emerging stance state attorneys general are taking on regulating US companies that dominate the internet:State officials are raising risks for companies such as Facebook[2] Inc.,Twitter[3] Inc. and Alphabet[4] Inc.'s Google as the states begin piecing together a coordinated legal strategy for confronting the firms over alleged antitrust violations and data-privacy abuses, and over what some Republicans say is a suppression of conservative speech.Tensions have been simmering for months, but they surfaced publicly last week when the Justice Department said U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions would meet with several state attorneys general[5] later this month to discuss a 'growing concern' that the companies are hurting competition and 'stifling the free exchange of ideas' on their platforms.CNBC reported the text of the full statement by Department of Justice (DoJ) spokesman Devin O'Malley last week inSessions getting serious about tech company crackdown, will meet with state attorneys general[6]:'We listened to today's Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on Foreign Influence Operations' Use of Social Media Platforms closely. </p><p>The Attorney General has convened a meeting with a number of state attorneys general this month to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.'The CNBC account highlighted Trump's calls for the breakup of tech companies:Last month[7], Trump said Facebook[8], Twitter[9] and Google[10] were 'treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful.' He's also said the companies could be engaging in antitrust behaviors, without offering evidence for the claims.And the WSj account noted that the Federal Trade Commission has started to investigate the industry. State AGs Can Drive Independent Enforcement Agendas AGs in many states have considerable authority to drive independent enforcement agendas. Take the example of the tobacco industry, which I discussed inStates Launch New Joint Probe into Company Sales and Marketing Practices for Opioids[11]:In 1998, following many years of investigation and litigation, 46 state AGs entered into a Master Settlement Agreement with the four largest tobacco companies- Brown ...lliamson, Lorillard, Philip Morris, and R.J. Reynolds. As part of that settlement, the companies agreed to pay out more than $200 billion over 25 years, as well as to make significant changes in the way they sold and marketed their products. They also agreed to disband their lobbying organizations, to fund anti-smoking efforts, and to make public information provided during the discovery process.Such separate priorities may also extend to areas in which the federal government regulates extensively, such as securities law (or at least did in the not-so-distant past), as I discussed in this post,Mary Jo White Leaves Behind a Weakened SEC for Trump to Weaken Further[12]:During the administration of President George W. Bush, state attorneys general used state authority to prosecute securities and financial transgressions. Notably, former New York state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer relied on authority provided by the state's 1910 Martin Act, which predates the federal securities law, to take legal action actions against insurance firms for brokerage practices, hedge funds for improper trading practices in mutual fund shares, and investment banks for conflicts of interest that distorted the investment research they provided, to name some of the most significant initiatives. Spitzer's successors as attorney general, current New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and current Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, have not had the impact that Spitzer had when he was lauded as the Sheriff of Wall Street.Another New York regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services used the threat of denying a NY state banking charter to force tougher terms on settlements in which the Eric Holder/Loretta Lynch DoJ and other federal regulators had rolled over (see this post by Yves for a summary: Wall Street's Nemesis, Benjamin Lawsky, to Resign in June[13].).Other states, such as California, have their own expansive statutes- though now-US Senator Kamala Harris demonstrated when she served as California's AG that she more interested in virtue-signalling than taking scalps. Crusading state AGs are not just Democrats. As I wrote in New EPA Lawsuit Policy Advances Trump's Deregulatory Agenda[14], Scott Pruitt- who recently stepped down as EPA administrator:has been a longstanding bugbear of environmentalists. In his previous role as attorney general for the state of Oklahoma- a major producer of oil and natural gas- he either filed or joined lawsuits that sought to stymie the modest pro-regulatory environmental and climate change agenda the EPA previously espoused.Like-minded Republicans AGs often joined him in these efforts. So, What's On the Agenda for These AGs? The most immediate threat to the tech industry might arise in the area of antitrust enforcement- which, shall we say, has not been a major priority for recent administrations, although the European Union has investigated and fined Google over competition concerns. Yet as recently as the Clinton administration, Microsoft was a target of an major antitrust action instigated by multiple state AGs in conjunction with the DoJ Over to the WSJ again:The [Sessions meeting ] announcement\u2014released amid last week's congressional hearings[15] into the practices of Facebook and Twitter\u2014shed little light on who was raising the concerns or what remedies might be under consideration. But recent comments by several of the state attorneys general suggest they are actively exploring an antitrust investigation and hope to enlist Washington. 'I think the companies are too big, and they need to be broken up,'RepublicanLouisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said Thursday in a radio interview.There is some evidence that party politics are driving this potential enforcement initiative:Republicans' allegations that the tech companies suppress conservative voices has bubbled up for months in conservative media and was amplified by Mr. Trump late last month[16]. Democrats have said that is the issue\u2014more than antitrust policy\u2014behind the coming Justice Department meeting, with Republicans hoping to stir their conservative base ahead of November elections All the attorneys general who are expected to attend this month's meeting in Washington are Republicans, with Democratic officials saying they have yet to be invited.Although it's too soon to say where these preliminary discussions between the DoJ and the the state AGs may lead, I want to draw attention to another development- the weakening of the hold of corporate Democrats on the direction of the party. David Sirota published an interesting piece in Monday's Guardian, Yes, let's wipe out Trump. But take neoliberal Democrats with him, too[17]. Sirota's piece wasn't especially concerned about Big Tech per se, and focused on a percolating progressive policy agenda. He mentions regulation, but only as it affects financial firms and pharmaceutical companies and where so far, corporate Democrats have successfully insulated their paymasters from any significant increase in legal liability. But if progressives start to wield greater influence on the Democratic side- and Republican AGs follow through with a tougher approach to enforcement- the future might shape up to be a less comfortable operating environment for US internet companies. Or at least we might hope.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/09/state-ags-step-enforcement-against-tech-companies.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/09/state-ags-step-enforcement-against-tech-companies.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banana republic[18], Guest Post[19], Legal[20], Politics[21], Regulations and regulators[22] on September 12, 2018[23] by Jerri-Lynn Scofield[24].

But state investigators plan to do so soon, though the precise timing is not yet set, said the two people familiar with the states\u2019 plan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A smaller group of the state representatives met last month in Washington with antitrust officials at the Justice Department, which has started a broad antitrust review of the technology industry. The Federal Trade Commission has begun an antitrust investigation of Facebook, and it is reviewing the actions of other companies as well.</p><p>Lawmakers in Congress are investigating the industry as well. An antitrust hearing last month included executives from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>The states\u2019 plan to move forward with an investigation was first reported Monday <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/attorneys-general-to-move-forward-with-antitrust-probe-of-big-tech-11566247753?mod=hp_lead_pos1\">by The Wall Street Journal.</url></p><p>The states can play a key role, often in concert with federal regulators and Congress, in building evidence and public support for major investigations. That was the pattern in the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft, when 20 states joined the Justice Department in suing the software giant in 1998.</p><p>But major antitrust investigations can take years, whether they result in legal action or not. And unlike the Microsoft case, which focused on a single company, the pursuit of today\u2019s tech giants is more wide-ranging.</p><p>The review by the Justice Department, for example, is of competitive behavior by the dominant digital companies. Each of the big four that regulators are focused on \u2014 Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple \u2014 operates in somewhat different markets, including internet search, online advertising, e-commerce and social networks.</p><p>The states\u2019 plan, though still taking shape, seems to be along the lines of the broader Justice Department review. The states have not formally agreed on a specific plan of action and details are still being discussed, said a senior attorney at one state attorney general office who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was barred from discussing the investigation.</p><p>Amazon and Facebook declined to comment.</p><p>An Apple spokesman pointed to the company\u2019s previous statements, which have said that Apple faces fierce competition and helps thousands of companies reach customers. A representative for Google pointed to testimony from Adam Cohen, its director of economic policy, to Congress in July.</p><p>\u201cIn the face of intense competition, we are proud of our record of continued innovation,\u201d Mr. Cohen said at the time. \u201cWe have helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world.\u201d</p><p>The state attorneys general offices did not make any formal comments on plans for an investigation. The tentative timing is that an announcement will be made in early September.</p><p>But the states did form a bipartisan, multistate unit called the Tech Industry Working Group months ago.</p><p>\u201cAs attorneys general, we need to evaluate and address specific conduct, utilizing our existing antitrust and consumer protection laws,\u201d Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, a Democrat, said in a statement. He added that the working group was \u201clooking at the intersection of technology and antitrust.\u201d</p><p>What action, if any, should be taken to curb the market power of the big tech companies is uncertain. Proposals vary from breaking them up, a step endorsed by Senator Elizabeth Warren in her presidential campaign, to forcing them to share data to make it easier for rivals to compete.</p><p>But there is a growing criticism of the big tech companies, and increasing calls to rein them in.</p><p>In a congressional hearing last month, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, and chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, said that the tech companies had brought innovation and growth to the economy.</p><p>But he added that their rise had come with too few restraints.</p><p>\u201cIn an effort to promote and continue this new economy, Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said. \u201cAs a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201d</p><p>Not everyone would agree with his critique. But the states, as well as federal antitrust watchdogs and Congress, are signaling the pendulum has swung and it is time for closer scrutiny and oversight.</p><p>Steve Lohr covers technology and economics.

Now, they're setting their sights on another target: Big Tech. After years of federal inaction, the state watchdogs are initiating sweeping antitrust investigations against Silicon Valley's largest companies, probing whether they undermine rivals and harm consumers. Their latest salvo arrives today, when more than 40 attorneys general are expected to announce their plan to investigate Google, delivering a rare rebuke of the search-and-advertising giant \u2014 and its efforts to maintain that dominance \u2014 from the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court. </p><p>The states seek to probe allegations that the tech industry stifles startups, delivers pricier or worse service for Web users and siphons too much personal information, enriching their record-breaking revenue at the cost of consumer privacy. \"The growth of these (tech) companies has outpaced our ability to regulate them in a way that enhances competition,\" said Keith Ellison, a Democratic attorney general from Minnesota who is signing on to the effort to probe Google. \"They need to be regulated,\" he continued, \"and my view is, it's the state AG's job to do it, particularly when the federal government is not necessarily a reliable partner in the area.\" Historically, the federal government has taken the starring role in competition matters, including investigations into potential monopolies and mergers, and such inquiries involving the tech giants are underway. But the states are potent actors in their own right, with the power to invoke local laws on antitrust and consumer-protection and to tap Washington's antitrust statutes on behalf of their residents. When state attorneys general have banded together on a broad, bipartisan basis, they've managed to muscle major changes to other industries. They forced billions of dollars in payments from Big Tobacco to pay health claims and finance anti-smoking campaigns in the 1990s. Two decades later, they helped reform unfair mortgage lending practices. More recently, states have led lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies they contend are responsible for the opioid crisis. Now, they threaten to do the same to Silicon Valley, unleashing potentially wide-ranging antitrust punishments against not only Google but all of tech's biggest players. \"The attorneys general have found they can actually rewrite the rules for entire sectors and individual companies through these cases,\" said Rob McKenna, a former attorney general in Washington state and now a partner at the law firm Orrick. \"The attorneys general have a lot of power here to achieve regulation by litigation.\" With Google, states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, today plan to focus their probe on the way the search giant amasses data and maintains its dominance, particularly in advertising, where it captured more than 38% of the online advertising market in 2018, according to eMarketer. \"Online advertising is everywhere,\" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. \"This investigation is about whether that market is fair and open to all. We hope that Google will cooperate in the states' investigation.\" Google long has been a problem in the eyes of some states. Missouri opened a competition investigation of Google in 2017, when the state attorney general's office was led by Josh Hawley, now a Republican U.S. senator. Jim Hood, the Democratic attorney general of Mississippi, has sued Google over its privacy practices. And Arizona's Republican attorney general, Mark Brnovich, last year opened his own probe into allegations that Google misused people's location data. \"Any time you get that many attorneys general, both Democrats and Republicans, liberal and conservatives all across the ideological spectrum, agreeing that something needs to be done about Google ... it speaks volumes,\" Brnovich said in an interview about antitrust. Adding to Google's headaches, top deputies to Paxton in Texas repeatedly have faulted the company, alleging that it stifles conservatives' speech online. Google has denied claims of deliberate political bias, and evidence supporting the allegation is scant, but Texas leaders have raised the possibility that they could probe the company for the matter. Paxton's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the antitrust investigation, which The Post first reported last week. \"Google's services help people every day, create more choices for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country,\" said company spokesman Jose Castaneda. \"We look forward to working with the attorneys general to answer questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001097832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X10-BMN1-DY6F-J30J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
