This is a damning condemnation, and, in my view, an untenable situation in a country governed by the rule of law.\"</p><p>While there is consensus in Ottawa that something needs to be done about the country's privacy laws, just what to do and whether those laws can be enacted in 2020 remains up in the air.</p><p>Therrien argues that to adequately regulate technology companies, his office needs the ability to levy fines and the ability to make legally binding orders requiring companies to change their practices.</p><p>\"Privacy is so much more than consenting or not to terms and conditions dictated by companies,\" Therrien told reporters at a news conference in Ottawa. \"It is a human right, and it must be explicitly recognized as such in privacy laws.\"</p><p>The report pointed to investigations around the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, which resulted in minimal action despite the fact that Therrien's office determined that several companies broke Canadian law.</p><p>\"The fact that Facebook said it would not implement recommendations to address those issues leaves a high risk that the personal information of Canadians could be used in ways that they do not know or suspect, exposing them to potential harms,\" Therrien wrote. \"This is extremely worrisome given the vast amount of sensitive information people have entrusted to Facebook.\"</p><p>In response to Therrien's report, both Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner and New Democrat Charlie Angus called for action from the governing Liberals.</p><p>\"Today's Privacy Commissioner's report underscored the Liberal government's lack of action to protect the value of data and the privacy of Canadians,\" Rempel Garner said. \"In his press conference, he (Therrien) stated that nearly every Canadian's data has been the subject of a privacy breach at some point.\"</p><p>Angus accused the Liberals of being too cozy with big tech.</p><p>\"I'd say the government needs to explain why they're continuing to protect Facebook and the digital giants,\" he said.</p><p>At this point, even tech companies are generally calling for more regulation, with the caveat that any new rules need to be carefully crafted in a way to avoid stifling innovation.</p><p>\"It can't simply be the privacy commissioner as judge, jury and executioner without due process,\" said Andre Leduc, vice-president of policy at industry group ITAC.</p><p>\"Industry has some concerns with the concept of the privacy commissioner having broad order-making powers, because there has to be an element of due process included.\"</p><p>Earlier this year the federal government published a Digital Charter, which lays out 10 principles that will guide future policy on data and privacy issues. The Digital Charter calls for tougher penalties for companies that violate the rules, and giving some additional powers to the privacy commissioner's office.</p><p>Innovation Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains was not available for an interview in response to the privacy commissioner's report, but in an email Dani Keenan, a spokeswoman for Bains, highlighted the Digital Charter as the government's key policy document.</p><p>\"Our government takes the protection of Canadians'personal information very seriously. Trust is the foundation on which our digital and data-driven economy is built,\" Keenan wrote in an email.</p><p>But in his report, Therrien argued that the Digital Charter's approach is too limiting, by requiring the privacy commissioner to get approval from the attorney general to take action.</p><p>\"At the moment, as we saw in our Facebook investigation, an organization that we have found in contravention of the law can simply ignore our recommendations and 'wait it out'until the courts have come to the same conclusion as my office,\" Therrien wrote.</p><p>\"In the government's proposal under the Digital Charter, a further step would be added, in the form of a review by the Attorney General.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is a damning condemnation, and, in my view, an untenable situation in a country governed by the rule of law.\"</p><p>While there is consensus in Ottawa that something needs to be done about the country's privacy laws, just what to do and whether those laws can be enacted in 2020 remains up in the air.</p><p>Therrien argues that to adequately regulate technology companies, his office needs the ability to levy fines and the ability to make legally binding orders requiring companies to change their practices.</p><p>\"Privacy is so much more than consenting or not to terms and conditions dictated by companies,\" Therrien told reporters at a news conference in Ottawa. \"It is a human right, and it must be explicitly recognized as such in privacy laws.\"</p><p>The report pointed to investigations around the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, which resulted in minimal action despite the fact that Therrien's office determined that several companies broke Canadian law.</p><p>\"The fact that Facebook said it would not implement recommendations to address those issues leaves a high risk that the personal information of Canadians could be used in ways that they do not know or suspect, exposing them to potential harms,\" Therrien wrote. \"This is extremely worrisome given the vast amount of sensitive information people have entrusted to Facebook.\"</p><p>In response to Therrien's report, both Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner and New Democrat Charlie Angus called for action from the governing Liberals.</p><p>\"Today's Privacy Commissioner's report underscored the Liberal government's lack of action to protect the value of data and the privacy of Canadians,\" Rempel Garner said. \"In his press conference, he (Therrien) stated that nearly every Canadian's data has been the subject of a privacy breach at some point.\"</p><p>Angus accused the Liberals of being too cozy with big tech.</p><p>\"I'd say the government needs to explain why they're continuing to protect Facebook and the digital giants,\" he said.</p><p>At this point, even tech companies are generally calling for more regulation, with the caveat that any new rules need to be carefully crafted in a way to avoid stifling innovation.</p><p>\"It can't simply be the privacy commissioner as judge, jury and executioner without due process,\" said Andre Leduc, vice-president of policy at industry group ITAC.</p><p>\"Industry has some concerns with the concept of the privacy commissioner having broad order-making powers, because there has to be an element of due process included.\"</p><p>Earlier this year the federal government published a Digital Charter, which lays out 10 principles that will guide future policy on data and privacy issues. The Digital Charter calls for tougher penalties for companies that violate the rules, and giving some additional powers to the privacy commissioner's office.</p><p>Innovation Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains was not available for an interview in response to the privacy commissioner's report, but in an email Dani Keenan, a spokeswoman for Bains, highlighted the Digital Charter as the government's key policy document.</p><p>\"Our government takes the protection of Canadians'personal information very seriously. Trust is the foundation on which our digital and data-driven economy is built,\" Keenan wrote in an email.</p><p>But in his report, Therrien argued that the Digital Charter's approach is too limiting, by requiring the privacy commissioner to get approval from the attorney general to take action.</p><p>\"At the moment, as we saw in our Facebook investigation, an organization that we have found in contravention of the law can simply ignore our recommendations and 'wait it out'until the courts have come to the same conclusion as my office,\" Therrien wrote.</p><p>\"In the government's proposal under the Digital Charter, a further step would be added, in the form of a review by the Attorney General.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is a damning condemnation, and, in my view, an untenable situation in a country governed by the rule of law.\"</p><p>While there is consensus in Ottawa that something needs to be done about the country's privacy laws, just what to do and whether those laws can be enacted in 2020 remains up in the air.</p><p>Therrien argues that to adequately regulate technology companies, his office needs the ability to levy fines and the ability to make legally binding orders requiring companies to change their practices.</p><p>\"Privacy is so much more than consenting or not to terms and conditions dictated by companies,\" Therrien told reporters at a news conference in Ottawa. \"It is a human right, and it must be explicitly recognized as such in privacy laws.\"</p><p>The report pointed to investigations around the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, which resulted in minimal action despite the fact that Therrien's office determined that several companies broke Canadian law.</p><p>\"The fact that Facebook said it would not implement recommendations to address those issues leaves a high risk that the personal information of Canadians could be used in ways that they do not know or suspect, exposing them to potential harms,\" Therrien wrote. \"This is extremely worrisome given the vast amount of sensitive information people have entrusted to Facebook.\"</p><p>In response to Therrien's report, both Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner and New Democrat Charlie Angus called for action from the governing Liberals.</p><p>\"Today's Privacy Commissioner's report underscored the Liberal government's lack of action to protect the value of data and the privacy of Canadians,\" Rempel Garner said. \"In his press conference, he (Therrien) stated that nearly every Canadian's data has been the subject of a privacy breach at some point.\"</p><p>Angus accused the Liberals of being too cozy with big tech.</p><p>\"I'd say the government needs to explain why they're continuing to protect Facebook and the digital giants,\" he said.</p><p>At this point, even tech companies are generally calling for more regulation, with the caveat that any new rules need to be carefully crafted in a way to avoid stifling innovation.</p><p>\"It can't simply be the privacy commissioner as judge, jury and executioner without due process,\" said Andre Leduc, vice-president of policy at industry group ITAC.</p><p>\"Industry has some concerns with the concept of the privacy commissioner having broad order-making powers, because there has to be an element of due process included.\"</p><p>Earlier this year the federal government published a Digital Charter, which lays out 10 principles that will guide future policy on data and privacy issues. The Digital Charter calls for tougher penalties for companies that violate the rules, and giving some additional powers to the privacy commissioner's office.</p><p>Innovation Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains was not available for an interview in response to the privacy commissioner's report, but in an email Dani Keenan, a spokeswoman for Bains, highlighted the Digital Charter as the government's key policy document.</p><p>\"Our government takes the protection of Canadians'personal information very seriously. Trust is the foundation on which our digital and data-driven economy is built,\" Keenan wrote in an email.</p><p>But in his report, Therrien argued that the Digital Charter's approach is too limiting, by requiring the privacy commissioner to get approval from the attorney general to take action.</p><p>\"At the moment, as we saw in our Facebook investigation, an organization that we have found in contravention of the law can simply ignore our recommendations and 'wait it out'until the courts have come to the same conclusion as my office,\" Therrien wrote.</p><p>\"In the government's proposal under the Digital Charter, a further step would be added, in the form of a review by the Attorney General.\" Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

In a letter to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on November 13, the groups wrote that Fitbit would help Google to increase its dominance over internet searches, and give it another way to gather health information. MediaNama has reached out to Google for comment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The groups said that the acquisition should not be permitted because \"Google already holds a dominant position in the digital marketplace, health data is critical to the future of that marketplace, and the data protection concerns stemming from the acquisition will have far-reaching consequences including a dramatic erosion of consumer privacy.\" Watchdog groups such as Public Citizen, Centre for Digital Democracy, and Consumer Federation of America, were among the nine organisations that wrote to the FTC. The groups raised the following concerns:</p><p>* Google's previous acquisitions: Google's 2008 acquisition of Doubleclick also deserves close scrutiny, because Google had failed to uphold representations that it had made to the Commission regarding the personal data gathered by DoubleClick. They further noted that Google has acquired more than 200 firms, many of which implicate personal privacy, and those deals should also be re-examined.</p><p>* Dissemination of health care data: Google should not gain control of Fitbit's sensitive and individualised health data, which can be integrated with data from its current services to deepen its own monopoly.  Google has assured (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2019/11/223-google-health-records-nightingale/\">https://www.medianama.com/2019/11/223-google-health-records-nightingale/</url>) transparency about health data collection, and said that privacy and security are paramount. Fitbit had also ensured that its health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads.</p><p>* FDA's stamp for Fitbit: The letter noted that a pending Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stamp of approval for Fitbit would give Google even more influence in healthcare data and technology. Fitbit is already on the track of getting clearance as one of the nine companies chosen to pilot the FDA's Software Precertification (Pre-Cert) Program, and its involvement with Google would allow the company to have the influence over healthcare data.</p><p>*  Big tech firms had stopped acquisitions previously: Microsoft and IBM had stopped its acquisition activity during their historic anti-trust probe. This indicates \" we are now in an era of unprecedented disregard for legal authority\", the letter noted.</p><p>*  Anti-competitive harm of acquisition: The FTC erred while assessing the Facebook/Instagram deal and Amazon/Whole Foods deal, by defining the relevant markets as photo-sharing applications and groceries respectively. The FTC should not make the same mistake by ignoring the consolidation this acquisition would cause within the health data market place, the letter noted.</p><p>*  Personal data collection: Google had acquired consumer data, regardless of its source, having recently been fined $170M (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/04/youtube-kids-fine-personal-data-collection-children-\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/04/youtube-kids-fine-personal-data-collection-children-</url>) for collecting children's personal data through its subsidiary YouTube, the groups noted.</p><p>Google continued with its acquisition despite facing antitrust investigation: Anti-trust lawmakers</p><p>The chair of the US's antitrust subcommittee in the Justice Department noted that Google had continued with its acquisitions despite facing antitrust investigations, per Reuters report (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-antitrust-congress/key-antitrust-lawmaker-frustrated-with-googles-fitbit-deal-idUSKBN1XN2WY\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-antitrust-congress/key-antitrust-lawmaker-frustrated-with-googles-fitbit-deal-idUSKBN1XN2WY</url>). The chair was pointing towards Google's acquisition of Looker and Fitbit. The acquisition of Looker, a big data analytics company, was approved last week, Reuters said. It is worth noting that politicians and regulators had also criticised Google and other tech companies (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/71bc2255ec32472e999eacaf07565eff\">https://apnews.com/71bc2255ec32472e999eacaf07565eff</url>) for how they use customer data to gain profits. The US Justice Department and the committee is looking into Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, while the FTC is investigating Facebook and Amazon, to understand how personalised advertising transactions work, the report said (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-antitrust-congress/key-antitrust-lawmaker-frustrated-with-googles-fitbit-deal-idUSKBN1XN2WY\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-antitrust-congress/key-antitrust-lawmaker-frustrated-with-googles-fitbit-deal-idUSKBN1XN2WY</url>).</p><p>Google's Project Nightingale collected millions of Americans' health records</p><p>The letter to FTC also talked about Google's Project Nightingale, under which Google has secretly gathered (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2019/11/223-google-health-records-nightingale/\">https://www.medianama.com/2019/11/223-google-health-records-nightingale/</url>) the health data of millions of Americans on behalf of the United States' second-largest healthcare provider, Ascension. It involves the collection of health data such as lab results, diagnoses, hospitalisation records and other records including patient names and dates of birth, from Ascension's hospitals without informing patients of such collection. Ascension is a Catholic non-profit that operates 150 hospitals in 20 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>What are Google and Ascension working on? They are together testing software that will allow healthcare providers to search a patient's electronic health record by \"specific data categories and create graphs of the information, like blood test results over time\", The New York Times had reported (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/business/google-ascension-health-data.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/business/google-ascension-health-data.html</url>). This includes Ascension transferring patient records to Google's servers, with the intention of giving medical professionals better access to patient data, improve care and get insights on health data to improve treatment, the report had said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0050443910</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ5-DRK1-DXMP-K30W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>PUBLIC CITIZEN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We also take a look at HHS' new guidance on direct liability of business associates, a pair of circuit court decisions involving privacy issues and legislation passed in three states involving protection of personal information.The GDPR at the One Year Mark: A Work in ProgressNevada Enacts Right to Opt Out of Sale of InformationMaine Restricts Sale of Personal Information by ISPsOregon Expands Data Breach Notice LawFourth Circuit Holds That Dish Network is Liable for Violating Telephone Consumer Protection ActSixth Circuit Holds Payment Processing Company Liable for Damages Related to Attack on Merchant's Credit Card SystemNew Guidance Clarifies Direct Liability of Business Associates Under HIPAAEuropean Council Approves New EU Cybersecurity Act The GDPR at the One Year Mark: A Work in Progress On May 25, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect, causing uncertainty regarding the volume and nature of enforcement, with many organizations fearing a shift toward more frequent and aggressive fines. However, following its first anniversary, the reality of GDPR is significantly more nuanced.The first year of GDPR implementation has met mixed reviews. While there have been some clear developments among data protection regimes, the heavily anticipated level of sweeping enforcement activity has yet to materialize. </p><p>While enforcement has, by many accounts, lagged expectations, entities, whether they be 'data controllers' or 'data processors,' are taking steps to adapt to the GDPR's new requirements. Additionally, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and national supervisory authorities are putting effort into releasing regular guidance and creating tools to assist companies with compliance in their day-to-day practices.The GDPR also has played an important role in increasing individual awareness of data protection. The European Commission's March 2019 Eurobarometer survey of approximately 27,000 European citizens showed that around 67 percent of those surveyed know what the GDPR is. The Eurobarometer survey also reported that 73 percent have heard of at least one of the six rights guaranteed by the GDPR, while 57 percent indicated they know there is a public authority in their country responsible for protecting their data rights (compared to 2015's survey, in which only 37 percent were aware).Internationally, the GDPR may start to appear as less of an outlier in data enforcement. Brazil has enacted the Brazilian Data Protection Law (which takes effect August 2020), and other countries, including India and China, are considering similar legislation. In the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (which takes effect January 2020) imposes requirements that are similar to those included in the GDPR.Data Breach Notifications and Enforcement ActionsThe GDPR mandates data breach notifications when personal data an entity is responsible for is accidentally or unlawfully disclosed. Since May 25, 2018, there have been 89,271 data breaches logged by European Economic Area (EEA) supervisory authorities. Of those, 63 percent have been closed and 37 percent are ongoing. The Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom have reported the highest numbers of breaches, with the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) noting that it has logged more than 14,000 data breaches (a marked increase over the roughly 3,300 notifications it received in the preceding year). There have been 144,376 queries and complaints \u2014 primarily concerning promotional emails, telemarketing and video surveillance, or CCTV \u2014 from individuals in the EU since the GDPR's implementation, with 41,000 of those coming from the U.K. and 6,000 from Ireland.Additionally, GDPR enforcement is still evolving. As of May 22, 2019, there were over 280,000 cases pending investigation across 27 EEA countries. The Data Protection Commission (DPC) in Ireland, a country with a large tech hub, is currently investigating 18 'large data breaches, systemic privacy issues and other serious violations at technology firms,' but actions have not yet been taken.As of February 2019, only 91 fines had been imposed under the GDPR. Total fines have reached \u20ac56 million, but the majority of that figure stems from the single \u20ac50 million fine levied against Google by the French supervisory authority, Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Liberts (CNIL) (Google is currently challenging this action). Prior to its implementation, privacy advocates had expected more accountability and higher levels of enforcement under the GDPR's comprehensive reforms. That said, the U.K. ICO and the Irish DPC publicly have hinted that enforcement actions under the GDPR will be coming in the next few months, but that cases take time to build.The enforcement actions taken by EEA Supervisory Authorities thus far span a variety of industries and entities, signaling that GDPR fines and enforcement notices will not be reserved for big tech firms or major breaches, as evidenced below by some of the first enforcement actions at a national level: On May 28, 2019, the Belgian Data Protection Authority fined a Belgian mayor \u20ac2,000 for the use of personal data that initially was collected for local administration purposes in an electoral campaign. On July 17, 2018, the first GDPR fine in Portugal was levied against Centro Hospitalar Barreiro Montijo. The Portuguese data protection authority fined the hospital \u20ac400,000 for allowing indiscriminate access to personal data, alongside other violations of basic principles of processing, the absence of adequate technical and organizational measures, and inability to ensure continued confidentiality. On April 4, 2019, the Italian Data Protection Authority issued a \u20ac50,000 fine against the Rosseau internet platform for a number of privacy security issues related to data controlled by Italian political party Movimento 5 Stelle. As of May 22, 2019, German regional data protection authorities had imposed a total of \u20ac449,000 in fines, including in November 2018, in which a \u20ac20,000 fine was levied against a chat and dating service for a breach in which hackers stole 300,000 customers' personal data. The service notified the relevant authority about the breach and an investigation uncovered a lack of appropriate technical safeguards for the protection of data by storing its users' passwords in unencrypted plain text. On April 4, 2019, the U.K. ICO issued a preliminary enforcement notice against Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for the biometric data processed in their Voice ID system. The ICO found that HMRC had given customers insufficient information about the data processing and did not give them a chance to consent. The U.K. ICO's first enforcement notice under the GDPR was levied in October 24, 2018, against AggregateIQ Data Services Ltd, a Canadian company targeting EEA data subjects, for processing personal data without the data subjects' knowledge, as well as for undeclared purposes and without a lawful basis. In both cases, the ICO demanded data deletion as a precursor to imposing a fine.Looking Ahead and Key TakeawaysWhile 25 EU member states have adopted national legislation for implementing the GDPR, Greece, Slovenia and Portugal have yet to put their domestic laws in place. Organizations also have called for more clarity on specific elements of the law, including details around data breach notifications and subject rights requests.As simple cases give way to more complex cases, there are more regulatory questions that will require resolution. For example, there are concerns that individuals, such as former employees, may use data subject rights as punitive measures against companies or to obtain pre-litigation disclosure. In addition, as increasing volumes of personal data are processed in cross-border investigations, the eDiscovery process \u2014 and other statutorily or treaty-enabled production requirements, such as those contemplated under the U.S. Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or CLOUD Act \u2014 will require the EDPB and supervisory authorities to be clear about the GDPR's scope, as well as require investigators and companies to be more attentive to the GDPR's requirements.At the one year mark, there is no doubt that the GDPR has set standards through which legislators and citizens around the world are becoming more aware of their governments' abilities to protect individual rights. Nevada Enacts Right to Opt Out of Sale of Information A new Nevada law requires website operators to offer consumers the ability to request that their personal information not be sold to data brokers.On May 29, 2019, Nevada enacted Senate Bill 220 (the Nevada Amendment),1[1] which amends the Nevada Internet Privacy Act to require 'operators' to establish a designated email address, toll-free telephone number or website through which consumers can make a verified request that their covered information not be sold. A verified request means the operator has verified the authenticity of the opt-out request and the identity of the consumer 'using commercially reasonable means.'An 'operator' is broadly defined as a person who: owns or operates a website or online service for commercial purposes; collects and maintains certain items of personally identifiable information from consumers who reside in Nevada and use or visit the website or online service; and engages in any activity that constitutes a sufficient nexus with Nevada to satisfy constitutional requirements. Such activity includes doing business in Nevada, purposefully directing activities toward Nevada or transacting with the state or a Nevada resident.Certain entities are exempt from the definition of 'operator,' including, among others, financial institutions and entities subject to certain federal privacy laws. These entities include any entity regulated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), any service provider to an operator, and certain manufacturers of a motor vehicle or persons who service motor vehicles who process covered information.A 'sale' for purpose of the Nevada Amendment is 'the exchange of covered information for monetary consideration by the operator to a person for the person to license or sell the covered information to additional persons,' unless the information is disclosed for purposes consistent with a consumer's reasonable expectations.'Covered information' refers to any one or more of the following data points about a consumer collected by an operator through a website or online service: first and last name, street name and name of city or town, email address, telephone number, Social Security number, an identifier permitting a specific person to be contacted, and/or any other information about a consumer collected from that consumer through the website or online service of the operator and maintained in combination with an identifier that makes the information personally identifiable.Operators must respond to consumers' requests within 60 days. A 30-day extension is available if 'reasonably necessary' and notice has been provided to the consumer. An operator that has received a verified request submitted by a consumer must not make any sale of any covered information the operator has collected or will collect about that consumer.The attorney general may bring a legal action against an operator who violates the Nevada Amendment and can seek an injunction or civil penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation.California Consumer Privacy ActAlthough some have been quick to compare the Nevada Amendment to a comparable provision in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), there are some critical differences between the two states' approaches.First, the Nevada Amendment defines \"sale\" more narrowly than the CCPA, effectively limiting it to the sale (for monetary consideration) to data brokers. The CCPA includes any type of consideration and the \"sale\" to any other person, not just data brokers. Consumers also are defined more narrowly in the Nevada Amendment than under the CCPA in that employee and business data is not included, although the definition is broad enough to include what most businesses care about (i.e. , consumers purchasing goods or services). That said, the Nevada Amendment does not carve out smaller businesses the way the CCPA does. In addition, \"covered information\" is more narrowly defined under the Nevada Amendment, excluding some of the broad areas picked up by the CCPA, such as device identifiers or household information. Finally, in contrast to the CCPA, the Nevada Amendment does not require a business to provide clear and conspicuous notice to consumers of their opt-out right regarding the sale of their information.Key TakeawaysOverall, the Nevada Amendment is a prime example of the growing reality that, in the absence of federal privacy legislation, companies will be forced to comply with a patchwork of inconsistent state law obligations. Maine Restricts Sale of Personal Information by ISPs A new Maine law requires internet service providers (ISPs) in the state to obtain customer consent before using, disclosing or selling their personal information.On June 30, 2019, Maine enacted An Act to Protect the Privacy of Online Customer Information (the Maine Act)2[2]. The Maine Act, which goes into effect July 1, 2020, will ban, subject to certain exceptions, ISPs in Maine from 'using, disclosing, selling or permitting access to customer personal information unless the customer expressly consents to that use, disclosure, sale or access.' Instead of providing customers the right to opt out of utilization of their data, the Maine Act restricts ISPs from using customers' data unless they have affirmative customer consent. It also requires ISPs to provide 'clear, conspicuous and nondeceptive' notice of customer rights and ISP obligations. Additionally, the act requires that ISPs take 'reasonable measures' to protect customer information from unauthorized use, disclosure or access when implementing security measures.'Customer personal information' restricted from sale refers to: personally identifiable information about the customer including, but not limited to, the customer's name, billing information, Social Security number, billing address and demographic data; and information from a customer's use of broadband internet access service including, but not limited to, the customer's search history, application usage history, precise geolocation information, financial information, health information, IP address, communications contents and information pertaining to the customer's children.A customer may revoke consent to use, disclose, sell or permit access to customer personal information at any time. As well, a provider may not refuse to serve a customer who does not provide such consent, nor may a provider charge a customer a penalty or offer a customer a discount, based on a decision to provide or withhold such consent.Among other exceptions, the law states that providers may use, disclose, sell or permit access to customer personal information without express, affirmative customer consent to: provide the service from which the information is derived; advertise or market the provider's communications-related services to the customer; comply with a lawful court order; initiate, render, bill for and collect payment for broadband internet access service; protect users from fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of or subscription to ISP services; and provide geolocation information concerning the customer in connection with certain enumerated emergency situations.Key TakeawaysWith the enactment of the Maine Act, the state's ISPs now face the strictest consumer privacy protections in the country. More importantly, passage of the legislation represents another \"one-off\" privacy law that will force companies to either adopt different policies for different states or consider each new privacy law the \"floor\" for what they need to do nationwide. Many expect the new law to be challenged as violating Federal Communications Commission rules or the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution. Oregon Expands Data Breach Notice Law Oregon updated its data breach notification requirements to improve transparency surrounding data breaches and expand the definition of personal information.On May 24, 2019, Oregon enacted a new law, SB 864,3[3] which amends the Oregon Consumer Identity Theft Protection Act, effective January 1, 2020, and renames it the Oregon Consumer Protection Act (the act). The act now extends existing data breach notification obligations to a 'vendor,\" defined as a person 'with which a covered entity contracts to maintain, store, manage, process or otherwise access personal information for the purpose of, or in connection with, providing services to or on behalf of the covered entity.' A 'covered entity' is defined as a person that 'owns, licenses, maintains, stores, manages, collects, processes, acquires or otherwise possesses personal information in the course of the person's business, vocation, occupation or volunteer activities,' except with respect to a person who acts solely as a vendor.A vendor that discovers a security breach or has reason to believe a security breach occurred must (1) notify any contracted covered entities as soon as practicable, but no later than 10 days after discovering (or having reason to believe that) a breach has occurred, and (2) notify the attorney general if a breach or suspected breach involved the personal information of more than 250 consumers or a number of consumers that the vendor could not determine.The amendment revises the original legislation's definition of 'personal information' to include user names or other means of identifying a consumer for purposes of permitting access to the consumer's online account, together with any other method necessary to authenticate the user name or means of identification.The act also provides that compliance with security measures under federal data security laws (including HIPAA and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) gives covered entities and vendors in alleged violation of the act an affirmative defense regarding information protected under the act, but not protected under federal laws.Key TakeawaysOregon joins a number of states which, in recent years, have strengthened their data breach notification obligations. But, as discussed earlier, the growing number of state legislation continues to make it difficult for entities to adhere to the patchwork of cybersecurity rules and legislation that exist in each state jurisdiction, but not at the federal level. Fourth Circuit Holds That Dish Network is Liable for Violating Telephone Consumer Protection Act The U.S. District Court for the Fourth Circuit affirmed a $61 million treble damages award, finding that the National Do Not Call Registry applies to agents, including sales representatives and third-party marketers, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).On May 30, 2019, the Fourth Circuit affirmed a district court decision in favor of a certified class, concluding that satellite television company Dish Network (Dish) is liable for the actions of its agent, Satellite Systems Network (SSN), and reaffirmed judgment for approximately 11,000 plaintiffs.4[4]Unlawful Phone CallsThe named plaintiff, Dr. Thomas Krakauer, alleged that he began to receive telemarketing phone calls in May 2009, asking him to buy services from Dish, at a number he had listed in the Do Not Call Registry. The calls were placed by SSN, acting on behalf of Dish. Krakauer called Dish to complain about the calls, and he was placed on the company's individual Do Not Call list. In 2015, Krakauer sued Dish for the improper calls under the TCPA, seeking redress for himself and all persons who objected to these calls.TCPA RegulationsThe TCPA allows a private right of action for violations of the Do Not Call Registry regulations. By its plain language, the TCPA's private right of action contemplates that a company can be held liable for calls made on its behalf, even if not placed by the company directly. The District Court Finds Liability and Willful ViolationsIn September 2015, the court certified a class that closely followed the text of the TCPA, allowing Krakauer to bring his claim on behalf of all persons (1) whose numbers were on the National Do Not Call Registry or the individual Do Not Call lists of either Dish or SSN for at least 30 days and (2) received two calls in a single year. The case went to trial, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Krakauer and the class plaintiffs, finding that the telemarketing practices violated the TCPA and that Dish was liable for the calls placed by SSN. The jury awarded damages of $400 per call. The district court determined that Dish's violations were willful and knowing, and thus trebled the damages award under the TCPA. Dish appealed, challenging the class certification and its own liability for the wrongful calls placed by SSN.The Fourth Circuit AffirmsThe Fourth Circuit affirmed the class certification, ruling that the class was harmed under the TCPA by receiving unwarranted phone calls from SSN, acting as a third-party marketer for Dish. The court rejected all three issues that Dish raised on appeal. First, the court rejected Dish's argument that the members lacked standing because their injury did not rise to \"a level that would support a common law cause of action\" based on Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins5[5], which explains \"the traditional core of standing\" is a personal stake in the case. The court found that receiving unwanted calls on multiple occasions is an intrusion of personal privacy, and therefore, the members had standing.Second, the court held the class was properly certified as a matter of civil procedure. Under Rule 23 and the remedial purpose of the TCPA, the cause of action allows for \"resolution of issues without extensive individual complications.\" Dish's contention that the class definition was overbroad was rejected, as the court found the TCPA's cause of action for violations of the Do Not Call Registry can be brought by any \"consumer,\" not only \"subscribers.\"Finally, the court affirmed the jury's conclusion that SSN was acting as Dish's agent at the time it made the improper calls. The evidence supporting an agency relationship was considerable, including suggestive contract provisions, authorization to use Dish's name and logo to carry out business operations, and the Voluntary Compliance Agreement that Dish entered into with 46 state attorneys general, wherein Dish clearly stated its authority over SSN with regard to TCPA compliance. Although Dish contended that its contract with SSN expressly disavowed an agency relationship, the court found that parties cannot avoid legal obligations of agency by contracting out of them. Dish also asserted it should not be responsible for SSN's actions because it occasionally instructed SSN to follow the law, and, therefore, no reasonable jury could conclude the calls were made within the scope of SSN's authority as Dish's agent. The court found that the jury appropriately resolved this question, concluding that the evidence showed Dish failed to address these concerns in any meaningful way and was profiting from the SSN sales tactics. Accordingly, the court concluded that \"this case demonstrates the need to look beyond the contract, as a failure to do so might lead to absolving a company, like Dish, that acquiesced in and benefitted from a wrongful course of conduct that was carried out on its behalf.\"Key TakeawaysAs the court's decision in Krakauer illustrates, TCPA plaintiffs are not required to show any threshold level of injury to have standing if they are able to prove the statutory elements of a TCPA claim, which could possibly lead to an increase in such claims. The Fourth Circuit's decision also may lead to claims involving instances where third parties were used to conduct telemarketing activities. Sixth Circuit Holds Payment Processing Company Liable for Damages Related to Attack on Merchant's Credit Card System On June 7, 2019, the Sixth Circuit affirmed6[6]a district court ruling in favor of Spec's Family Partners, a chain of liquor stores in Texas, finding that First Data Merchant Services, the payment processing company used by Spec's, must bear the costs stemming from two attacks on the payment card network used by the stores.Attacks on Payment Card System and Cost-Shifting Chain ReactionSpec's Family Partners fell victim to two attacks on its payment card network in which malware was installed to access customer data. An investigation revealed that Spec's failed to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) prior to the attacks, which left it vulnerable to breaches in its customers' data security.The attacks, and subsequent data theft, triggered a cost-shifting reaction down the credit card chain. The banks that issued the compromised credit cards first reimbursed the defrauded cardholders and replaced their customers' credit cards. Card brands Visa and Mastercard then issued assessments on the acquiring bank, Citicorp Payment Services Inc., to cover its costs. Third, Citicorp demanded payment from First Data to cover the costs imposed on Citicorp by the credit card companies. Finally, First Data sought reimbursement for those costs from Spec's.In order to recoup its costs, First Data withheld the proceeds of routine payment card transactions from Spec's, placing the proceeds in a reserve account. Spec's refused to pay First Data and filed suit in an attempt to recover the $6.2 million that First Data withheld.District Court Grants Summary JudgmentThe District Court for the Western District of Tennessee granted summary judgment in favor of Spec's, holding that First Data materially breached the Merchant Agreement when it diverted funds to reimburse itself for the card brand assessments. Specifically, the court found that such assessments constituted consequential damages that could not be recovered under a limitation of liability clause in the First Data contract. The District Court refused to interpret the assessments as 'third-party fees and charges,' for which Spec's would be liable under the contract.Sixth Circuit AffirmsThe Sixth Circuit reviewed de novo the grant of summary judgment and affirmed the District Court ruling in its entirety. First Data argued on appeal that Spec's was liable for the assessments under the contract's indemnification clause and because they constituted 'third-party fees and charges' under the agreement.The Sixth Circuit rejected First Data's indemnity argument, finding that the assessments passed down to First Data constituted consequential damages because, according to Tennessee law, consequential damages are the natural consequences of the act complained of, but not the necessary results of such conduct. In other words, the assessments constituted consequential damages because the data breaches, reimbursements to cardholders and levying of assessments were the natural results of PCI DSS non-compliance. However, the results were not a necessary consequence of non-compliance in the sense that a non-compliant merchant might never suffer a data breach and the card brands might not issue assessments in the case of PCI DSS non-compliance on its own. The court concluded that because the data breaches and the imposition of assessments did not necessarily follow from the actions of Spec's, the losses sustained were consequential and Spec's could not be held liable for such damages under the contract.First Data also argued that Spec's was liable under a provision in the contract stating that Spec's was responsible for all 'third-party fees and charges' associated with the use of First Data's services. By looking to the ordinary and plain meaning of the term, as well as its meaning within the context of the entire agreement, the Sixth Circuit held that the term 'third-party fees and charges' did not include or contemplate assessments imposed by credit card companies. The court also noted that the only other federal appeals court to address this exact issue reached the same conclusion that the term excludes assessments following a data breach.7[7]Finally, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling that First Data materially breached the agreement by withholding payments due to Spec's. The Sixth Circuit found that the PCI DSS non-compliance was an immaterial breach that was cured when Spec's took steps to achieve full compliance. The court concluded that First Data materially breached the agreement by withholding payments due to Spec's and thereby deprived Spec's of the principal expected benefit under the contract. New Guidance Clarifies Direct Liability of Business Associates Under HIPAA In late May 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights released guidance regarding business associate liability under HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH).In 2013, HHS issued a rule, under the HITECH Act, that made business associates directly liable for certain HIPAA-related violations. However, since its enactment, the scope and reach of the rule has been unclear. On May 24, 2019, the Office of Civil Rights issued a fact sheet to clarify the rule, listing 10 provisions of HIPAA for which business associates can be held directly liable.The HHS guidance will clarify matters regarding business associates, which include consultants, billing companies and medical record providers, among others. Though HIPAA applies directly to health care providers, plans and clearinghouses, certain vendors qualify as business associates if they handle protected health information (PHI) on behalf of, or in providing services to, a HIPAA-covered entity.The 10 provisions under which business associates will be held liable are: Failure to provide the HHS secretary with records and compliance reports; cooperate with complaint investigations and compliance reviews; and permit access by the secretary to information, including PHI, pertinent to determining compliance. Taking any retaliatory action against any individual for filing a HIPAA complaint; participating in a retaliatory investigation or other enforcement process; or opposing an act or practice that is unlawful under the HIPAA rules. Failure to comply with the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule (which includes the risk analysis requirement). Failure to provide breach notification to a covered entity or another business associate as required by the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule. Impermissible uses and disclosures of PHI. Failure to disclose a copy of electronic PHI to either the covered entity, the individual or the individual's designee (whichever is specified in the business associate agreement) to satisfy a covered entity's obligations regarding the form and format, as well as the time and manner, of access. Failure to make reasonable efforts to limit PHI to the minimum extent necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure or request. Failure, in certain circumstances, to provide an accounting of disclosures. Failure to enter into business associate agreements with subcontractors that create or receive PHI on their behalf, and failure to comply with the implementation specifications for such agreements. Failure to take reasonable steps to address a material breach or violation of the subcontractor's business associate agreement.Key TakeawaysThe new guidance clarifies uncertainty regarding when and how business associates can be held directly liable for HIPAA violations. In addition to liability imposed by the Office for Civil Rights, a business associate should be aware of contractual commitments regarding the handling of PHI imposed by covered entities. European Council Approves New EU Cybersecurity Act The newly passed EU Cybersecurity Act intends to combat the increasing risks of cyberattacks as they become more sophisticated and, more frequently, international. The Cybersecurity Act aims to prompt a coordinated and collaborative response across the EU.BackgroundOn June 7, 2019, the European Council formally approved Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (the Cybersecurity Act), which came into force on June 27, 2019. The Cybersecurity Act enacts two principal measures: (1) strengthens the role of the European Union Agency for Network and Information and Security (ENISA), the EU agency that improves network and information security in the EU and (2) introduces the first EU-wide cybersecurity certification framework. For now, the single certification framework will be voluntary rather than compulsory, with the goal of building a harmonized framework for uniform cybersecurity standards across the EU. The introduction of the Cybersecurity Act will not, therefore, necessarily prompt immediate action, but demonstrates the EU's cybersecurity focus and gives a framework for manufacturers and service providers of information and communications technology (ICT) products, services and processes to be mindful of.The Ever-Expanding Role and Powers of ENISAThe Cybersecurity Act strengthens ENISA by granting a permanent mandate and strengthening its human element. ENISA has been a temporary EU agency since its establishment in 2004. While ENISA is not a regulatory authority, it enhances cybersecurity prevention work by advising the European Commission, analyzing data and raising awareness on potential cyber threats. With the Cybersecurity Act, ENISA's role expands through the supervision and facilitation of information sharing across the EU. ENISA also will now maintain a website providing information on cybersecurity, including the certification framework.Additionally, ENISA will now assist with designing certification schemes for ICT products and services. At a foundational level, these schemes will ensure that key cybersecurity standards are adhered to by ICT manufacturers and service providers, such as by ensuring an adequate level of protection of personal data against unauthorized storage, processing, destruction, exfiltration, loss or alteration. ENISA also is tasked with reviewing certification schemes every five years to ensure their ongoing compliance with adequate cybersecurity standards.Certification FrameworkThe Cybersecurity Act establishes an EU cybersecurity certification framework that aims to assure consumers of the safety of their data, allowing them to trust the cybersecurity of ICT products, services and processes. The framework also provides a uniform certification process in the EU, avoiding multiple, conflicting and overlapping certifications between countries. The ENISA certification schemes will be based on European or international cybersecurity standards, though they will be supervised and implemented by national authorities. EU member states also may establish individual national penalties for infringing the schemes.It is expected that the first ENISA certification scheme will be published within a year of the Cybersecurity Act's effective date. The Cybersecurity Act grants the European Commission the power to decide whether to adopt the published ENISA certification schemes. The European Commission also will re-evaluate, by 2023, whether some schemes should be mandatory. As such, it will take time to conclude whether the Cybersecurity Act is successful and whether the certification regime will become an effective, trusted and useful exercise for ICT providers and manufacturers, as well as consumers.Relationship With Other Data Protection and Cybersecurity LawsThe Cybersecurity Act dovetails closely with other European Union laws addressing data protection and cybersecurity, most notably the GDPR, which requires technical and organizational measures to safeguard the processing of personal data, and the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive), which was the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity and addresses potential cybersecurity threats against network and information systems. However, the Cybersecurity Act differs in that its purview extends beyond the NIS directive, which only applies to businesses classified as 'operators of essential services' and 'digital service providers,' whereas the Cybersecurity Act extends to all manufacturers and service providers of ICT offerings.Key TakeawaysThe Cybersecurity Act's true impact and efficacy remain to be seen. However, the increased focus on cybersecurity issues could facilitate the successful and widespread adoption of ENISA certification schemes. Cybersecurity has been a high priority for both businesses and the EU in recent years, and the Cybersecurity Act, if nothing else, reinforces the importance of strong cybersecurity standards._______________1[8] The full text of the bill can be read here[9].2[10] The full text of the bill can be read here[11].3[12] The full text of the amendment can be read here[13].4[14] Krakauer v.

This is a damning condemnation, and, in my view, an untenable situation in a country governed by the rule of law.\"</p><p>While there is consensus in Ottawa that something needs to be done about the country's privacy laws, just what to do and whether those laws can be enacted in 2020 remains up in the air.</p><p>Therrien argues that to adequately regulate technology companies, his office needs the ability to levy fines and the ability to make legally-binding orders requiring companies to change their practices.</p><p>\"Privacy is so much more than consenting or not to terms and conditions dictated by companies,\" Therrien told reporters at a news conference in Ottawa. \"It is a human right, and it must be explicitly recognized as such in privacy laws.\"</p><p>The report pointed to investigations around the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, which resulted in minimal action despite the fact that Therrien's office determined that several companies broke Canadian law.</p><p>\"The fact that Facebook said it would not implement recommendations to address those issues leaves a high risk that the personal information of Canadians could be used in ways that they do not know or suspect, exposing them to potential harms,\" Therrien wrote. \"This is extremely worrisome given the vast amount of sensitive information people have entrusted to Facebook.\"</p><p>In response to Therrien's report, both Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner and New Democrat Charlie Angus called for action from the governing Liberals.</p><p>\"Today's Privacy Commissioner's report underscored the Liberal government's lack of action to protect the value of data and the privacy of Canadians,\" Rempel Garner said. \"In his press conference, he (Therrien) stated that nearly every Canadian's data has been the subject of a privacy breach at some point.\"</p><p>Angus accused the Liberals of being too cozy with big tech. \"I'd say the government needs to explain why they're continuing to protect Facebook and the digital giants,\" he said.</p><p>At this point, even tech firms are generally calling for regulation, with the caveat that any new rules need to be carefully crafted in a way to avoid stifling innovation.</p><p>\"It can't simply be the privacy commissioner as judge, jury and executioner without due process,\" said Andre Leduc, vice-president of policy at industry group ITAC. \"Industry has some concerns with the concept of the privacy commissioner having broad order-making powers, because there has to be an element of due process included.\"</p><p>Earlier this year the federal government published a Digital Charter which lays out 10 principles that will guide future policy on data and privacy issues. The Digital Charter calls for tougher penalties for companies that violate the rules, and giving some additional powers to the privacy commissioner's office.</p><p>Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains was not available for an interview in response to the privacy commissioner's report, but in an email Dani Keenan, a spokeswoman for Bains, highlighted the Digital Charter as the government's key policy document.</p><p>\"Our government takes the protection of Canadians'personal information very seriously. Trust is the foundation on which our digital and data-driven economy is built,\" Keenan wrote.</p><p>But in his report, Therrien argued that the Digital Charter's approach is too limiting, by requiring the privacy commissioner to get approval from the attorney general to take action.</p><p>\"At the moment, as we saw in our Facebook investigation, an organization that we have found in contravention of the law can simply ignore our recommendations and 'wait it out'until the courts have come to the same conclusion as my office,\" Therrien wrote. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is a damning condemnation, and, in my view, an untenable situation in a country governed by the rule of law.\"</p><p>While there is consensus in Ottawa that something needs to be done about the country's privacy laws, just what to do and whether those laws can be enacted in 2020 remains up in the air.</p><p>Therrien argues that to adequately regulate technology companies, his office needs the ability to levy fines and the ability to make legally-binding orders requiring companies to change their practices.</p><p>\"Privacy is so much more than consenting or not to terms and conditions dictated by companies,\" Therrien told reporters at a news conference in Ottawa. \"It is a human right, and it must be explicitly recognized as such in privacy laws.\"</p><p>The report pointed to investigations around the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, which resulted in minimal action despite the fact that Therrien's office determined that several companies broke Canadian law.</p><p>\"The fact that Facebook said it would not implement recommendations to address those issues leaves a high risk that the personal information of Canadians could be used in ways that they do not know or suspect, exposing them to potential harms,\" Therrien wrote. \"This is extremely worrisome given the vast amount of sensitive information people have entrusted to Facebook.\"</p><p>In response to Therrien's report, both Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner and New Democrat Charlie Angus called for action from the governing Liberals.</p><p>\"Today's Privacy Commissioner's report underscored the Liberal government's lack of action to protect the value of data and the privacy of Canadians,\" Rempel Garner said. \"In his press conference, he (Therrien) stated that nearly every Canadian's data has been the subject of a privacy breach at some point.\"</p><p>Angus accused the Liberals of being too cozy with big tech. \"I'd say the government needs to explain why they're continuing to protect Facebook and the digital giants,\" he said.</p><p>At this point, even tech firms are generally calling for regulation, with the caveat that any new rules need to be carefully crafted in a way to avoid stifling innovation.</p><p>\"It can't simply be the privacy commissioner as judge, jury and executioner without due process,\" said Andre Leduc, vice-president of policy at industry group ITAC. \"Industry has some concerns with the concept of the privacy commissioner having broad order-making powers, because there has to be an element of due process included.\"</p><p>Earlier this year the federal government published a Digital Charter which lays out 10 principles that will guide future policy on data and privacy issues. The Digital Charter calls for tougher penalties for companies that violate the rules, and giving some additional powers to the privacy commissioner's office.</p><p>Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains was not available for an interview in response to the privacy commissioner's report, but in an email Dani Keenan, a spokeswoman for Bains, highlighted the Digital Charter as the government's key policy document.</p><p>\"Our government takes the protection of Canadians'personal information very seriously. Trust is the foundation on which our digital and data-driven economy is built,\" Keenan wrote.</p><p>But in his report, Therrien argued that the Digital Charter's approach is too limiting, by requiring the privacy commissioner to get approval from the attorney general to take action.</p><p>\"At the moment, as we saw in our Facebook investigation, an organization that we have found in contravention of the law can simply ignore our recommendations and 'wait it out'until the courts have come to the same conclusion as my office,\" Therrien wrote.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

The US Congress\u2019 virtual face-off with Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg &amp; Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai on 30 July, on anti-competitive practices and abuse of their dominant positions, saw intense scrutiny as well as a public dressing down of some of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most influential figures.   The \u2018Big Tech\u2019 CEOs weathered antitrust questions on abusing their monopolies , killing competition, bullying rivals, to a range of other questions like \u201chelping China\u201d, censoring right-wing voices and helping Joe Biden.   India, with the world\u2019s second largest internet users in the world, is among the most important markets for \u2018Big Tech\u2019 \u2013 a term used to refer to a handful of large technology companies.   \u201cThe \u2018bigness\u2019 of these large technology companies is reflected in their market valuations, user base, and range of product offerings,\u201d said a recent report on \u2018Big Tech\u2019 in India by Tandem Research .   Apart from the Big Four \u2013 Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple \u2013 sometimes, this term (Big Tech) also includes companies like Microsoft, IBM, Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba.   The Quint accessed detailed reports and spoke to legal, technological experts as well as the CEO of Indian IT company, to find out what questions India could and should be asking \u2018Big Tech\u2019 companies, including, but not limited to the four that were summoned by US Congress.   1. Privacy   The issue of data privacy on platforms owned by \u2018Big Tech\u2019 companies has emerged, perhaps, as the single largest concerns among users. The dominant positions of the companies in the Indian market has also raised worries about the ways in which our data is processed and sold to third-parties.   Companies use data to understand consumer behaviour, personalise digital services and recommendations, as well as predict new demand.   Also Read: US Cong Picks on Pichai; Corners Bezos, Zuckerberg in 5Hr Grilling   In the Indian context, several examples have illustrated how the mismanagement of user data can result in tangible harm \u2013 From Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018 to Whatsapp\u2019s vulnerability being exploited to target at least 127 Indian citizens by the Pegasus spyware .   Moreover, Bezos\u2019 admission at the hearing that Amazon may have violated its policy of not using third-party seller data to make business decisions, by using the data to create and promote its own brands, raises concerns for sellers on the platform.   \u201c... their collective history of privacy failures and one-sided control of user activity have caught up to them, resulting in a stark lack of trust,\u201d says Mozilla\u2019s recent working paper, \u2018 A Framework for Forward-looking Tech Competition Policy. \u2019   Kunal Kislay, CEO, Integration Wizards, a Bengaluru-based industrial automation company, said, \u201cWe get relevant searches from Google, Facebook suggests us friends we may know and Amazon suggests things that we may need,\u201d adding, \u201cAre these services really free? I guess the cost is our privacy. I believe we have made a choice and the price needs to be paid now.\u201d   2. Misinformation   Facebook and its personal messaging service, WhatsApp, have emerged as the faces for the deluge of misinformation and hate speech in India, that has resulted in identity risks, communal and caste-based violence and mob lynchings.   Twitter, Instagram and Chinese-owned TikTok, have also been in the lens for struggling to filter fake news.   Globally, research has linked such incidents to misinformation, algorithmic amplification, and computational propaganda.   Even though platforms like Facebook have denied its characterisation as a media platform and generally shrugged editorial responsibilities, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 companies are as much editors, curators and amplifiers of news and information as they are publishers of content.   A recent report by the EU Disinfo Lab also draws attention to the funding and monetisation of disinformation. \u201cIt uncovers instances in which the Amazon Associates program played a key role in funding disinformation by providing \u2018a constant flow of monetised links usable by a disinformation actor(s),\u201d Tandem Research\u2019s report points out.  Story continues  In India, these issues are amplified \u201cas they intersect with prevailing socio-economic and cultural factors, including low levels of literacy, a burgeoning youth population and social heterogeneity,\u201d the paper further adds.   3. Parliamentary Committees   The antitrust hearing conducted by US Congress\u2019 House Judiciary Committee has also turned the lens towards India\u2019s Parliamentary Committees and the effectiveness of their functioning.   In particular, the Parliamentary Committee on IT, headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who took over from BJP\u2019s Anurag Thakur after the 2019 general elections, has little to show in terms of holding platforms accountable or asking tough questions.   Amid accusations of amplifying misinformation, violating privacy and compromising data of citizens, the only time the Committee decided to summon a big company executive was Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in February 2019, based on a complaint by a Right-wing collective about Twitter\u2019s alleged bias towards the Left-wing.   While the summon was a step towards getting powerful companies to depose before Parliament, experts questioned prioritising a partisan, political topic of unproven bias over examining violations of fundamental rights of citizens.   Speaking with historian Anthony Khatchaturian for his piece for The Quint , Tharoor, incumbent Chair of the IT Committee, referring to US Congress\u2019 open hearings, said \u201cThat kind of spectacle becomes impossible because of strict rules of confidentiality governing the Parliamentary Committees in India.\u201d   Tharoor went on to explain a major handicap: \u201cAlso, our committees can summon officials and outside witnesses but not ministers, which limits their effectiveness in influencing policy-making.\u201d   Also Read: Lessons For Indian Parl Panels From US, UK\u2019s Grilling of CEOs &amp; PM   4. Competition to Collaboration   Google, on 13 July, announced a $10 billion fund to \u201chelp accelerate India\u2019s digital economy,\u201d and two days later, confirmed a $4.5 billion investment in Jio Platforms. Facebook, too, announced a decision to invest $5.7 billion into Jio Platforms for a 9.9 percent slice, in April.   \u201cHow competition is turning into collaboration between foreign technology and domestic technology is a dynamic that will be interesting to watch. It will most probably not happen in public view but behind closed boardrooms,\u201d said Gunjan Chawla, Programme Manager, Technology &amp; National Security, at National Law University\u2019s Centre for Communication Governance.   Chawla points out it isn\u2019t just Facebook and Google\u2019s investments into Jio but a dozen entities investing in the company. Even Qualcomm Ventures, the investment arm of Qualcomm Incorporated, will invest Rs 730 crore in Jio Platforms for a 0.15 percent stake, according to their statements.   Among the less spoken about investments in Jio Platforms is that by US-based private equity firm, KKR, which poured in Rs 11,367 crore in the company for a 2.32 percent stake.   \u201cThe name doesn\u2019t mean much to Indians here but one of the partners at KKR is General David Petraeus, the former director of the CIA,\u201d Chawla said, adding that with the kind of strategic partners that are on board, there are concerns about data being concentrated in very few powerful hands.   5. Interoperability   Udbhav Tiwary, public policy advisor at Mozilla, highlights the importance of interoperable technology, an issue that lies not just at the core of competition, but also to the architecture of the internet.   \u201cInteroperability is the internet\u2019s secret sauce, and integral to how it was built,\u201d Mozilla\u2019s paper on competition policy states.   The paper goes on to explain that a key element behind the success of the digital platform economy is the ability of new technologies to build on top of previous ones. And a vertically integrated company that offers two products, one of which is used through the other, will engineer compatibility to realise the benefits of integration.   \u201cBut that must not be an excuse for engaging in harmful self-preferencing resulting in the intentional exclusion of competitors,\u201d the paper warns, adding that access to APIs by \u2018Big Tech\u2019 is vital in this regard.   An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.   \u201cAs the internet has become more and more centralised, more opportunity for gatekeeping behavior has arisen. As stated in our working paper on competition, there are some systemic changes needed in technology regulation, with standards and interoperability at their core,\u201d Tiwari said.   Digital platforms can offer data and functionality through APIs that enable downstream innovation and interoperability.   Withholding APIs or not providing sufficient APIs to downstream businesses, many of which are Indian start-ups, can severely harm competition, innovation and further squeeze the open nature of the internet.    .

The House and Senate privacy bills lack teeth and cede too much control to companies, American Civil Liberties Union and Consumer Reports officials said in interviews. State Sen. Reuven Carlyle (D) responded that his bill is \"the strongest, meaningful privacy measure that is on the table.\" House Innovation Committee Chair Zack Hudgins (D) has appeared more open to making changes in response to concerns, telling us his chamber's bill is a \"work in progress.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facing a Friday deadline to get bills out of fiscal committees, Washington lawmakers placed each privacy bill on Thursday schedules for executive action in the Senate Ways and Means Committee and the House Appropriations Committee. The meetings hadn't concluded by evening on the East Coast. Those panels heard testimony on each SB-5376 and HB-1854 at simultaneous hearings Wednesday.</p><p>It's \"extremely imperative\" to bring core tenets of the EU general data protection regulation to the U.S., Carlyle said in an interview. As the home of Amazon, Microsoft and Starbucks, Washington state has a duty to write a \"responsible and measured\" bill that doesn't create an inhibitive regulatory structure, he said. National legislation \"would make sense at an academic, white-paper level, but we live in the real world,\" said Carlyle, calling states laboratories of democracy. Until federal lawmakers \"get their act together, we're going to lead at the state level.\" Last year's California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) was a \"bold step forward,\" but Washington's bill gives \"much more detail\" on how to adapt GDPR for the U.S., he said.</p><p>\"Our committee is trying to find a realistic balance between the rights to data we want to establish in law, and practical implementation of those rights,\" Hudgins emailed us, responding to privacy groups' concerns. \"We moved the bill out of our committee before policy cutoff as a 'work in progress' with substantial pieces of the bill missing in order to continue the dialog and discussion.\" Committee members are working with Carlyle in the Senate, which is further along in work on the bill, he said.</p><p>The House tossed Carlyle's measure and started fresh with principles that better stress consumer control of data, said ACLU-Washington Technology and Liberty Project Director Shankar Narayan. The ACLU doesn't see \"room\" to improve the Senate version, he said. The privacy group, which slammed the Senate version in a Feb. 14 letter to Hudgins, wasn't included in the stakeholder process to develop legislation, he said. The ACLU largely likes the House's new direction and feels more involved in that chamber's process, but the group will be closely watching how consent and other terms are defined, he said.</p><p>Privacy advocates are finding more sympathy for their concerns in the House, where the bill seems to be \"in flux,\" said Consumers Union Director-Privacy and Technology Policy Justin Brookman. \"There's some potential there.\" CU's Consumer Reports opposed both bills in a Feb. 21 letter to Hudgins; Common Sense, Electronic Frontier Foundation and Privacy Rights Clearinghouse also signed.</p><p>Concerns</p><p>\"It's misleading to refer to them as privacy bills because they are actually written by the tech industry,\" namely Microsoft, Narayan said of the Washington legislation.</p><p>Proposed rules try to import GDPR but are \"riddled with loopholes ... such that the exceptions swallow the rule,\" and unlike in Europe, there would be no strong regulator to enforce them, the ACLU official said. Merely requiring risk assessments \"keeps the power in the hands of the vendors,\" and the Senate bill's proposed facial recognition rules are too permissive, he said.</p><p>Many of the proposed state rules rely on \"corporate assessments about privacy risk,\" giving companies more latitude to decide what is a privacy violation, said Brookman. While not perfectly written, California's privacy law gives consumers more substantial protections than Washington proposed, he said. It's fine for states to take different approaches but \"dangerous\" to set a precedent for allowing companies to decide what rights consumers should have, he said.</p><p>A risk assessment approach allows \"companies to own the work of understanding how they manage their customers' data in much more meaningful ways,\" Carlyle responded. \"Privacy advocates are simply not appreciating the constructive forcing function that risk assessments carry.\" Carlyle believes the state AG should oversee privacy and doesn't agree with privacy groups seeking a private right of action, he said.</p><p>Privacy risk assessments are \"a central element of responsible data governance around the world,\" emailed Future of Privacy Forum Policy Counsel Kelsey Finch. The nonprofit, which gets funding from big tech, internet and media companies, voiced neutrality on SB-5376 in a Wednesday letter to the Senate Ways and Means Committee. \"We do recommend that Washington legislators take account of a growing technical and legal literature around data identifiability, and seek to provide incentives for companies to de-identify personal data,\" Finch said. Lawmakers should take up facial recognition and other biometrics \"in separate, future regulatory efforts,\" she said.</p><p>Carlyle and state lawmakers are \"developing a serious and thoughtful privacy bill that is meaningful and based on strong privacy principles and practices,\" said Internet Association's Rose Feliciano, associate director-state government affairs for the northwest.</p><p>Hearings</p><p>The Washington Senate bill would provide the \"strongest privacy protections of any law in the United States,\" incorporating the best parts of GDPR and CCPA, said Microsoft Director-State Affairs Ryan Harkins at the Senate Ways and Means hearing. The House version is \"moving in the right direction,\" he said at the House Appropriations hearing that day.</p><p>Microsoft disagrees with giving consumers a private right of action, which is in a recent draft of the House bill, Harkins said. The company also wants a more comprehensive definition of data than what's now in HB-1854, he said. Harkins asked SB-5376 critics to give \"substantive feedback\" rather than \"throw stones.\"</p><p>The Senate bill \"reflects a serious and practical approach to a very complicated set of problems,\" said Alex Alben, chief privacy officer for Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D). The state has a \"rare window\" to adapt GDPR for the U.S., he said.</p><p>Some witnesses appearing at both hearings sought exemptions for industries that they said are highly regulated, including banks, hospitals and children's toys. Restricting law enforcement's ability to use facial recognition in public places could hurt public safety, testified Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs Policy Director James McMahan.</p><p>Multiple drafts of the House bill are floating as work continues, Hudgins told the Appropriations Committee. \"It's changing a lot.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJ0-2N41-DYRJ-031V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1164\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 01, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

That's a more than 10 per cent increase over their record-setting 2017 spending.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google alone made up about one-third of that total, spending more than $21.2 million in 2018. That's up almost 17 per cent from the previous year, when it spent more on federal lobbying than any other company. Amazon spent $14.2 million, Facebook spent $12.6 million, Microsoft $9.5 million and Apple $6.6 million. Their disclosures, released ahead of a midnight deadline, showed the Big Five invested to sway the Washington debate on a wide range of policy issues, ranging from privacy to antitrust.</p><p>This drastic increase in lobbying cash could prove a formidable hurdle to advocates and privacy hawks in Congress trying to pass a tough federal privacy bill. Lawmakers are insisting that 2019 will be the year they finally pass a national framework - and privacy advocates are increasingly concerned that tech companies' well-funded lobbying machine could outweigh consumers' voices on Capitol Hill.</p><p>\"The big concern is that the lobbying influence will result in a debate focusing on the wrong questions,\" said ACLU senior legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani. \"The central question should be, 'What is good for consumers?'\"</p><p>The eye-popping sum comes as tech companies find themselves clashing with Washington more than ever. Lawmakers and regulators have been sounding the alarm about companies' lax data practices and the misuse of consumer information by third parties since the public learned of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a political consulting firm that did work for the Trump campaign used people's data without proper permission. They're also scrutinizing whether the companies have done enough to crack down on disinformation campaigns after Russia used social media platforms to spread fake news and information during the 2016 campaign.</p><p>Technology companies are now coming to the table for the first time to create federal privacy legislation to head off a stringent new state law in California, which has been signed by the governor and will take effect in 2020. The law will give consumers the right to know what information companies collect about them, what they're doing with it and who they share it with. This new California law could pose a serious challenge to many of the companies' data collection practices and create serious impediments for businesses that rely on targeted advertising.</p><p>In addition to lobbying, privacy advocates are already on alert for signs that the technology industry is dominating the debate. In the fall, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation held a major privacy hearing, intended to kick off discussion about privacy at the national level in the wake of California passing its own privacy law. The hearing featured executives from several major technology companies, but it did not include consumer privacy advocates. The move sparked criticism, and the committee later held a hearing that featured such advocates.</p><p>As the Washington Post recently reported, the increased oversight of the industry is not likely to go away in 2019.</p><p>It's not just the companies' spending on lobbying that could sway the privacy debate in Washington. Their increased influence is also a reflection of the former high-profile policymakers and regulators who many technology companies have hired in recent years. Jeff Chester, the executive director for Center for Digital Democracy, told me that there's been a \"revolving door\" between both Republican and Democratic administrations and the technology industry lobby.</p><p>\"There is ultimately a huge conflict of interest,\" he told me, as Congress seeks to pass privacy legislation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019012449182398</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V8B-PT91-DY91-K026-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 24, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We respect the motive and passion of each side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If the decision on Prop. 24 were merely about the concept - stopping companies from collecting and exploiting personal information about us without our permission or often without our knowledge - it would be an easy call. But this is a complex, legalistic 52-page initiative crafted behind the scenes, including participation of the companies that are the supposed targets of regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It should be evaluated on its details, not merely its good intentions.</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, one of the nation's most aggressive and authoritative champions of privacy rights, has taken a neutral position on Prop. 24. \"It is a mixed bag of partial steps backwards and forwards.\" </p><p>That in itself should give voters pause. But several prominent consumer advocacy groups and the American Civil Liberties Union are emphatic in their opposition, arguing that it would weaken state law in some meaningful ways.</p><p>To be sure, Prop. 24 has prominent privacy advocates on its side, including Common Sense Media, whose CEO Jim Steyer argues that its creation of the California Privacy Protection Agency funded with at least $10 million annually would finally put teeth in the law.</p><p>Steyer also likes the provisions that would toughen protections with triple fines on violations for consumers under age 16.</p><p>Here's how the issue reached the Nov. 3 ballot:</p><p>- Alastair Mactaggart, a wealthy San Francisco real estate developer, alarmed at learning of the scale of privacy intrusion, was bankrolling a ballot initiative for the November 2018 ballot. He ended up withdrawing the initiative after the California Legislature passed a less sweeping but nevertheless landmark bill known as the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA that year.</p><p>- The CCPA then encountered intense lobbying from consumer advocates who wanted to strengthen it and businesses that found it too burdensome or difficult to comply with. It survived basically intact and took full effect in July.</p><p>- Even before the law took effect, Mactaggart worked with Sen. Bob Hertzberg, a Los Angeles Democrat and one of the Capitol's ace deal makers, to forge an initiative that would lock in the CCPA's privacy protections. Mactaggart had seen Big Tech's intensive lobbying in Sacramento and was convinced his brainchild \"will not survive in the Legislature without an initiative,\" which could be undermined only through another statewide vote. Hertzberg said it was the target of a \"feeding frenzy of powerful interest groups.\"</p><p>The basic framework of Prop. 24 is solid: give consumers the right to prevent businesses from sharing personal information and the ability to correct errors; prohibit businesses from keeping personal information for longer than necessary; limit the use of especially sensitive information such as race, religion, precise geolocation, union membership, sexual orientation or genetics or health data.</p><p>Yet the devil is in the details when it comes to regulating such a dynamic and deep-pocketed sector as the social media and tech giants who are trafficking in personal information.</p><p>Analyses by Consumer Reports and the Electronic Frontier Foundation - each neutral on Prop. 24 - characterize it as a missed opportunity to switch the burden from consumers to businesses by requiring the later to obtain permission <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">before </emphasis>scooping, sharing or monetizing personal information, a standard known as \"opt in.\" The initiative maintains an \"opt out\" standard: keeping the onus on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">you</emphasis> to protect your personal information.</p><p>Another major concern of the privacy advocates opposed to Prop. 24 is that it leaves the door open for \"pay for privacy\" schemes in which a business could charge users more if they opt out of sharing personal information. Robert Herrell, executive director of the Consumer Federation of California, suggested a few steps forward in the measure are \"dwarfed by a number of exemptions and special carveouts.\"</p><p>Few voters will sift through the 52 pages of fine print to determine which side is right. The fact that savvy lawyers on each side of Prop. 24 have done so and come to contrasting conclusions makes one thing clear: Litigation would be certain to follow its passage. Count on this: The companies that are monetizing our personal information in insidious ways would rush to court with their lawyers, and their interpretations, ready to argue that their practices are unaffected by the initiative's language.</p><p>And here is one more thing for voters to consider: If Prop. 24 really were as restrictive and airtight as advertised, is there <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">any</emphasis> doubt that those who are exploiting our personal information as a commodity would be pouring tens of millions into defeating it? Their silence is telling.</p><p>A good guiding principle for approaching these complicated initiatives is: When in doubt, vote no. It goes against a Californian's instincts to reject what is advertised as a privacy protection initiative, but some objects on the ballot are smaller than they appear. There are no advancements to law in this initiative that could not be enacted by the California Legislature, after public hearings and vetting to assure they actually achieve their intended purpose and the ability to course correct for unintended consequences that emerge.</p><p>There is sufficient doubt about Prop. 24 to make the decision clear. Vote no.</p><p>This commentary is from The Chronicle's editorial board. We invite you to express your views in a letter to the editor.

According to the group, the content of the contract is to a large extent redacted and that it would contest the department's decision for the public interest. The contract started from 14 December 2018 and will be in effect till 15 October 2024. It allows Amazon to use content from the NHS website to give reliable and informative answers to basic health questions asked to Alexa. </p><p>In July 2019, the UK government announced a partnership with Amazon so that people can have their medical questions answered by the company's virtual assistant. The move was expected to take some burden off the NHS as people would look up to Alexa rather than calling the former's hotline. According to Privacy International, the lines detailing the consequences for Amazon if it failed to comply with the terms of the contract have been redacted. This, the privacy group says will give way for questions as to whether the company was given any privileged status by the government. The group claimed that a sub-section titled Licensor API in the contract, which is an important aspect, also has a full paragraph redacted. Privacy International stated: \"While this particular contract may sound harmless at first - after all it is good news if Amazon uses the NHS as a trusted source for information for medical queries - we should not be na\u00efve about the intentions of big companies that are preying over the NHS. This particular partnership also raises questions when it comes to competition regulation of dominant players in the digital era. \"With their business model relying increasingly on the availability of consumers' data, dominant online platforms can engage in various forms of data exploitation or even impose unfair terms for consumers.\" The privacy group warned that the NHS should not turn into another advertising asset for big tech firms. Furthermore, it wants traditional helplines and sources of information to continue being accessible to those who cannot afford or decide not to have an Alexa device.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-C52508DF831748AB92D608B44C9F947B</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPN-2FB1-JC0X-H01F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"359\"/><timeReceived>1:12 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The search giant, which just helped Alphabet Inc. surpass a $1 trillion valuation, said it will eventually stop supporting third-party cookies in its ubiquitous Chrome browser.</p><p>The move won't end the Big Brother era of Big Tech, but Google is framing the decision as a significant step away from unbridled data mining. In a blog post, Google references privacy about a dozen times, an awkward pitch for a company that built a juggernaut of a business by tapping into cookies from its billions of users. Can Google, after pioneering and protecting an apparent invasion of privacy, sell its browser to consumers as a privacy-first service?</p><p>Google is going to try. That's because the other browser makers are embracing privacy as a competitive advantage. Apple Inc. added cookie restrictions to Safari several years ago. Microsoft Corp. has been building a raft of tracking-prevention mechanisms into its Edge browser. And Mozilla Corp. has made paid privacy tools a core selling point of its Firefox service, though they've failed to catch on so far, leading to job cuts last week.</p><p>When Google first introduced Chrome in 2008, it essentially marketed the new browser as an online operating system, one that would treat popular web services - email, messaging, video streaming\u00a0- as full-blown applications, rather than clunky web pages. Chrome was a fast, refreshing alternative to Firefox and Internet Explorer. In the decade since, it has soared in popularity: Chrome today boasts 63% worldwide market share, according to StatCounter.</p><p>Chrome also became a huge source of data, facilitating an ecosystem of Google services that kept feeding its advertising engine with more user information. The browser's search box defaulted, of course, to Google, while users could log into the platform via Gmail to seamlessly access its products such Drive, Docs, Maps and YouTube, enabling the company to fill up ever-more jars of cookies. The dominance of the browser raised privacy concerns. One test last year found a whopping 11,189 requests for cookies in a week of surfing on Chrome. But only recently has Google started comprehensively rethinking its privacy policies, partly due to regulatory pressure and changing consumer sentiments around data collection.</p><p>\"Users are demanding greater privacy - including transparency, choice and control over how their data is used\u00a0- and it's clear the web ecosystem needs to evolve to meet these increasing demands,\" Justin Schuh, director of Chrome engineering, wrote in the blog post last week.</p><p>Google deserves a measure of credit for adopting consumer protections that could undermine its relationship with marketers and publishers, and also raise further antitrust scrutiny. Still, such policies stop far short of ridding Google of ad-tracking altogether: They may simply end up increasing the value of so-called first-party cookies, which websites collect directly from their users, rather than through intermediaries.</p><p>One company well-positioned to keep gobbling those up from its many devoted users? Google.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-9595168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1T-JKT1-F039-F00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Nearly three months after announcing that the company would address a series of privacy missteps by rebuilding many of its features to emphasize smaller groups and ephemeral and encrypted communication, Facebook cited unresolved questions around so-called metadata and suggested it could be shared with the company's advertising arm in a letter to Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. </p><p>\"This is a work in progress that we expect to take several years, and it is still in its early stages,\" wrote Kevin Martin, Facebook's vice president for U.S. public policy. In the letter, which was dated Monday, Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman, wrote that Facebook aims to collect less data, keep it for a shorter time and hide message content even from the company itself. But he left open several possibilities about the use of the information to deepen what the company knows about users. Metadata is not the actual content of messages, but can contain information on users' contacts, devices and location from which, privacy advocates say, companies that already possess vast amounts of data on consumers could still collect valuable information and make inferences. In the case of Facebook, the advocates say, that information would still prove lucrative in the ad-targeting infrastructure that brought in much of the company's $15 billion revenue last quarter. In his letter to Facebook, Hawley asked what data the company would glean when users exchanged messages with advertisers, especially if they used a Facebook subsidiary that facilitates online payments, and whether that would be fed back into the advertising architecture. \"Information about transactions can be used for personalization on the Facebook platform in accordance with Facebook's data policy,\" Martin responded. Hawley, who has emerged as one of the foremost Republican critics of big tech companies, said in a statement that he was \"frankly shocked by Facebook's response.\" \"I thought they'd swear off the creepier possibilities I raised,\" said Hawley, who floated the possibility that Facebook could determine which users live together through rent payments on the platform. \"But instead, they doubled down.\" While Congress continues to debate privacy measures that would allow consumers to opt out of data collection service by service, Hawley has championed a proposal that would block all websites from collecting unnecessary data. Martin noted in the letter that the company uses metadata to \"help make the platform safer, reduce Spam and fraud, and cooperate with law enforcement requests\" \u2014 a purpose that he said would become more important once the company cannot see content directly. He added that Facebook would be consulting with law enforcement, regulators and privacy and safety experts on how to foster user confidence. The company did provide some specifics. It said it planned to encrypt private messages between more than two participants, but did not plan to offer complete encryption for the content shared in groups, which Martin said \"are well-suited for easily finding new communities of people with similar interests.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001065123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W77-HB21-JBRC-V0C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>ML2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 30, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That's in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states are also considering more aggressive protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the use of their personal data - where they've been, what they view, who their friends are -and the powerful companies who mine that information for profit.</p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law could simply be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive federal statute.</p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications all told senators that they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling over privacy back in April, was not present at the hearing.</p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation to provide meaningful consumer protections.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said both Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.</p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it.</p><p>Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws, the Internet Association said in a recent statement .

Members of the parliament's Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee expressed concern about the failure of U.S. authorities to provide enough data protection for EU citizens under the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.</p><p>In light of the growing European concerns, the future of the Privacy Shield looks vulnerable and suspending the agreement would be hugely disruptive to transatlantic commerce, according to Elaine Fahey, professor of law at City, University of London.</p><p>\"Almost a billion citizens are covered by the Privacy Shield so it's an extraordinary situation for both the public and private sector,\" she said in an interview.</p><p>Services at stake</p><p>At stake are a raft of transatlantic digital services, mainly supplied by tech companies and worth an estimated $70 billion trade surplus for the U.S. in 2015, according to the Commerce Department.</p><p>Yet, the business effect of halting data flows would be felt the most by small to medium-sized businesses without access to alternative mechanisms, according to Ashley Gorski, staff attorney at the nonprofit American Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>For instance, the European Union uses standard contractual clauses to ensure adequate safeguards for international data transfers, she explained.</p><p>The fact that these alternative data transfer methods are also facing a legal challenge from the Irish High Court in the Court of Justice of the European Union, following complaints brought forward by Schrems and Ireland's data protection commissioner, only exacerbates the problem.</p><p>\"If the Court of Justice [of the European Union] concludes that the U.S. surveillance regime is fundamentally incompatible with the right to guarantee privacy, then it is not just a matter of finding an alternative data-sharing mechanism. It's really about pushing Congress to completely reform surveillance laws in the U.S.,\" Gorski said.</p><p>Either way, Silicon Valley's losses could be tremendous, she added.</p><p>Warnings of fallout</p><p>While it is difficult to quantify the potential fallout, American businesses are already issuing early warnings.</p><p>A recent Microsoft 10-K filing said revisions to the current framework may require \"changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms.\"</p><p>What's more, tougher data laws   following the May launch of the GDPR   will further complicate matters for companies without a legal basis for EU-U.S. data transfers, said Dublin-based Simon McGarr, solicitor at McGarr Solicitors and director of Data Compliance Europe.</p><p>The GDPR introduced a swathe of legislative changes designed to strengthen rules around how EU citizens' data is collected, stored, managed and shared. The proposed measures include the possibility of fines of up to 4% of a company's global revenue for the most serious breaches.</p><p>\"Since the GDPR has come into effect, the consequences for an illegal data transfer are much more severe,\" McGarr said, adding that potential fines could be substantial even for medium-sized technology businesses.</p><p>\"The U.S. and EU are extremely data-heavy economies so, in the event of a doomsday scenario, this is going to become an issue for large companies that have relied on the Privacy Shield,\" he added.</p><p>U.S. and EU officials are set to meet this autumn for a review the Privacy Shield framework, but McGarr said a suspension of the agreement is likely.</p><p>He said: \"The Privacy Shield always looked a bit shaky, even when it was instituted. It was always under review right from the very start.\"</p><p>Editor's note: This article is part of a series about the future of privacy and data regulation in the EU and the U.S.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-45900598</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T20-YG71-JDVW-N1RK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"848\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Analysts and legal experts say it is still too early to know whether the law will result in better safeguards for consumers' data, but they note its impact will be unevenly felt among big and small companies or those with more or less resources and expertise in data collection and compliance standards.</p><p>Privacy Matters</p><p>Part 1: Tech firms face data disruption amid Privacy Shield uncertainty</p><p>Part 2: US weighs potential response to EU's new data protection law</p><p>Part 3: US big tech reports mixed impact from EU data protection law</p><p>The GDPR is a series of rules and privacy laws designed to strengthen the protections around how EU citizens' data is collected, stored and managed. The rules apply to organizations operating within the EU, as well as foreign entities that offer goods and services to EU customers. Among other provisions, the GDPR requires a company to obtain unambiguous affirmative consent from a user before collecting or processing the user's personal data, and it instructs companies to alert users of certain types of data breaches within 72 hours of learning of the occurrence. Companies found in noncompliance could face steep fines.</p><p>Facebook Inc. is among the first U.S. companies to directly attribute a decline in some of its key engagement metrics to the new EU law. The social media giant said both its daily active users, or DAUs, and monthly active users, or MAUs, fell in Europe during the second quarter as a result of the GDPR: European MAUs fell 1 million to 376 million, while DAUs slipped 3 million to 279 million. Executives also warned that the privacy law, along with Facebook's various platform updates and security investments, could weigh on revenue growth in the second half of the year. Facebook reported an 11% year-over-year increase in monthly active users globally, to 2.23 billion as of June 30.</p><p>Twitter Inc. attributed a 1 million sequential drop in MAUs in the second quarter in part to GDPR. Its numbers were also affected by the company's efforts to remove fake or suspicious accounts from the site. Twitter's global MAUs totaled 335 million for its most recent quarter. Company management warned that the data protection law could contribute to a further decline in active users in the third quarter.</p><p>GoDaddy Inc. Vice President of Global Policy James Bladel said at a Senate subcommittee hearing in July that GDPR compliance has been a \"major undertaking\" at the company, \"diverting time and engineering resources away from customer service and product development.\" GoDaddy is an internet domain registrar and web hosting company.</p><p>Bladel said the new privacy regime has \"significantly disrupted\" the industry's WHOIS service, an online directory of contact information for domain name registrants. WHOIS aids law enforcement in criminal investigations, but can also enable spammers to acquire personal data. The company is working to strike the right balance of providing WHOIS data for legitimate needs while protecting users' private information, Bladel said.</p><p>Executives at other tech companies reported a more muted impact in the most recent quarter. Those at Snapchat-parent Snap said they have not yet seen a meaningful impact from GDPR on their businesses; Alphabet's Google said they have been working on compliance for months, but did not provide further details during a second-quarter earnings conference call.</p><p>Kendall Burman, a cybersecurity and data privacy counsel at law firm Mayer Brown and a former deputy general counsel in the U.S. Department of Commerce, said in an interview that certain aspects of the GDPR have the potential to strengthen data protection in positive ways, but other components could present a \"compliance burden\" for companies that do not gather large amounts of sensitive user information.</p><p>The GDPR could also have significant implications for how U.S. companies invest in emerging technologies, such as blockchain and machine learning, she added.</p><p>\"Some aspects of GDPR compliance will intersect with those technologies [and] could certainly have an effect on their adoption in [companies'] products and services,\" Burman said.</p><p>Konstantin Rychkov, an analyst at market-research firm IDC, noted that the EU member states have not yet fully formed the list of auditing bodies to ensure company compliance, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the law's implementation. Companies operating in the EU were required to be fully compliant with the GDPR by May 25.</p><p>In an environment of increased regulatory risk and awareness about data security, legislative efforts like the GDPR could pave the way for a global privacy standard, but \"how that will progress is a big question,\" Rychkov said in an interview.</p><p>Overall, Michael Connor, executive director of Open MIC, a nonprofit organization that works with investors on media and technology issues, said in an interview it is too early to determine how the GDPR will impact U.S. companies and their business strategies.</p><p>\"The law has been adopted and what remains to be seen is how effectively it can be implemented,\" Connor said.</p><p>Editor's note: This article is part of a series about the future of privacy and data regulation in the EU and the U.S.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-45868825</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T20-YG71-JDVW-N1RG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Amid the ongoing debate, none of the U.S. Congressional bills introduced thus far have seen much movement, though a few states   most notably California   have pursued their own laws. Policy experts suggest that Europe's law could set the global standard for privacy rules unless U.S. federal lawmakers take action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Privacy Matters</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Part 1: Tech firms face data disruption amid Privacy Shield uncertainty</p><p>Part 2: US weighs potential response to EU's new data protection law</p><p>Part 3: US big tech reports mixed impact from EU data protection law</p><p>The European Union's landmark privacy law, enacted in May, overhauls the way its citizens' data is collected, stored and managed. The rules apply to organizations operating within the EU, as well as foreign entities that offer goods and services to EU customers. Among other provisions, the GDPR requires companies to receive unambiguous consent from a user before collecting or processing the user's personal data, and it instructs companies to alert users of certain types of data breaches within 72 hours of learning of the occurrence. Companies found in noncompliance could face steep fines.</p><p>Unlike the EU, the U.S. does not have an all-encompassing data privacy law. Rather, U.S. privacy protections are governed by various sector-specific laws and regulations covering different types of data, such as health and financial information. About 120 countries have enacted data privacy laws, according to a 2017 study from the University of New South Wales in Australia.</p><p>Christopher Painter, a former top cybersecurity diplomat at the State Department, pointed to the failed Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights as a potential model for a federal framework. The proposal, introduced in 2012 by the Obama administration, was designed to give consumers more control and transparency over what data companies collect and how they use it. While multiple bills were introduced that incorporated some of the Obama administration's suggested framework, none made it out of the committee review phase.</p><p>Roslyn Layton, a visiting scholar at conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute who analyzes the impact of policies on digital technology, said there are problems with Europe's GDPR and the U.S. should not rush to counter it.</p><p>\"I think that we're going to find out that GDPR cannot fly,\" she said in an interview, suggesting the privacy regime's enforcement could see international challenges. Instead, Layton believes the U.S. should focus on educating consumers about privacy and allowing the tech industry to incentivize its own innovations.</p><p>Despite much discussion about the U.S.'s response to GDPR, it remains unclear which branch of government would take the lead on efforts to enhance privacy safeguards   the White House, Congress or states.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce has reportedly reached out to tech companies, major internet service providers and consumer advocacy groups with the intention of rolling out a national draft privacy framework by this fall.</p><p>In Congress, various bills have attempted to offer a federal U.S. privacy solution, such as the Balancing the Rights Of Web Surfers Equally and Responsibly, or BROWSER, Act from Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. That bill would authorize the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to enforce privacy protections requiring broadband providers, search engines, mobile applications and other players to obtain opt-in consent before using sensitive customer information. In the Senate, Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and John Kennedy, R-La., introduced the Social Media Privacy Protection and Consumer Rights Act, which would mimic some GDPR provisions like giving consumers the right to opt-out of data collection and requiring that companies notify users of a breach within 72 hours of discovery. Neither bill has made it beyond the committee review phase.</p><p>It remains unclear what could be in the Trump administration's privacy framework, expected to roll out later this year.</p><p>Several states have taken matters into their own hands by passing state-level privacy regulations. California's law, widely considered the most ambitious enacted to date, gives consumers the right to request the categories and types of information a business has collected about them, as well as the source of the information and the business purpose behind the collection. The privacy bill passed California's legislature and was signed into law in June.</p><p>Layton believes that state laws like the ones in California actually break down commerce and should not be emulated in other parts of the country. \"California has more privacy laws than any state   people don't feel more safe or more private in California,\" she said.</p><p>She does, however, approve of the Commerce Department's efforts to confer with major U.S. tech companies and internet service providers about how to better protect consumer privacy. She also noted that companies with opaque privacy policies have already seen market backlash, pointing to the response this past quarter to Facebook, which faced increased scrutiny over its data protection efforts after a series of disclosures that indicated user data may have been mishandled by some third parties. The company lowered its guidance and saw its stock price tumble after disclosing weakness in some of its second-quarter user figures and saying that expenses related to improving data security would remain higher-than-normal in the near term.</p><p>Some members of the business community believed a global, harmonized standard would ease the regulatory burden on companies that do business across international borders.</p><p>\"I think we should be looking at different models around the world and all the conversations we are having and hopefully, hopefully get to a place where it's not just there are clear rules in the United States, but there are clear and consistent rules globally,\" said Victoria Espinel, president and CEO of U.S.-headquartered trade group Business Software Alliance, on a recent episode of C-SPAN's \"The Communicators\" series. The BSA's membership includes large companies such as Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp.</p><p>James Bladel, vice president of policy at GoDaddy Inc., recently told lawmakers that GDPR and GDPR-equivalent frameworks are gaining momentum overseas. \"I think the answer is that we continue to show U.S. leadership by helping to push back on the differences and the inconsistencies between the various frameworks and focus on those areas of commonality,\" he said.</p><p>Painter believes the U.S. should act soon to assert its values in the global privacy debate and called on the U.S. to put forth an \"attractive alternative\" to the GDPR and other international privacy standards during recent Senate testimony.</p><p>\"If we don t have a key or  an attractive alternative to other countries who are looking at this, they re going to adopt those standards,\" he said.</p><p>Editor's note: This article is part of a series about the future of privacy and data regulation in the EU and the U.S.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-45872232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T20-YG71-JDVW-N1RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1231\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

It's pitting privacy advocates against . . . checking my notes . . . other privacy advocates?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, also known as the CPRA, is being pushed by one of the authors of - and is supposed to improve upon - the state's existing California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took  effect this year. The CCPA gives consumers the ability to opt out of the sale of some of our information, but demands we jump through a lot of hoops to protect our privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So I was surprised to discover the battle lines emerging over the new CPRA, which has the American Civil Liberties Union aligned with corporate archenemies, including data brokers and the online ad industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fight is not only creating strange bedfellows, but\u00e2\u20ac\u00afthe proposition's murky language leaves lots of confusion for voters come November.</p><p>My takeaway: The CPRA isn't the aggressive battle with big tech some privacy advocates wanted and won't introduce a new paradigm for how California protects data rights.</p><p>But it makes enough changes to existing law - which stays in place if the proposition fails -  that it could alter the balance of power with data-hungry corporations. There's just little agreement on whether those changes are, added up, better for consumers or corporations - or just kind of a wash. And whatever California does on privacy could end up becoming a floor for data rights across the country, because it's hard for companies to treat Californians differently.</p><p>The CPRA shows how messy privacy policy can become when advocates themselves can't agree on how hard to push, or who gets to lead the charge. That should be a warning to other states considering privacy laws, as well as those hoping for a federal one.</p><p>Driving and funding the CPRA is Alastair Mactaggart, a real estate developer who, as an outsider among privacy advocates, played a big role in getting the CCPA passed in 2018. Mactaggart also helped finance the CCPA initially as a ballot proposition but compromised to get a version passed by the state legislature instead.</p><p>Mactaggart told me his motivation for launching the CPRA was to fix problems with the CCPA.</p><p>As a ballot initiative that can only be overturned by another one, he said the CPRA would become \"a baseline for privacy law that can't be weakened.\" A provision in Proposition 24 allows the legislature to amend it, but only for purposes \"to enhance privacy and [that] are consistent with and further the purposes and intent of this Act.\"</p><p>The CPRA adds new limits on how businesses can use \"sensitive personal information\" - such as race, sexuality and precise location. Consumers would have to give their permission before such data could be sold. And it makes a big change to how the law gets enforced. Instead of relying on the California's attorney general, it creates a new data privacy agency and requires the state to fund it with at least $10 million. \"This would fund about 50 people,\" Mactaggart said. \"The [Federal Trade Commission] has 40 people for the entire nation\" to enforce privacy.</p><p>Fighting the CPRA is Mary Stone Ross, a former lawyer for the Electronic Privacy Information Center who also used to work with Mactaggart's Californians for Consumer Privacy and was a co-author of the original CCPA. She says the CPRA not only doesn't go far enough to improve the CCPA, but actually rolls back some of its protections. And her new organization, California Consumer and Privacy Advocates Against Prop 24, has gotten the support of a consortium including the ACLU, Color of Change, Media Alliance and the California Small Business Coalition.</p><p>Ross shared a laundry list of her problems with the new proposition. \"We can all agree there are awesome things that will move privacy forward, but hidden in the 52 pages are a lot of things that are going to move it backwards,\" she told me. For example, she says, even the language allowing for the CPRA to be modified could be used to harm future pro-privacy moves because it also stipulates that amendments should give \"attention to the impact on business and innovation.\"</p><p>Ross doesn't like that the CPRA would mean a delay in enforcement of the law as a new privacy agency gets set up, and that it has a carve-out in Proposition 24 for loyalty clubs, such as supermarket cards offering discounts in exchange for tracking purchases. She also doesn't like that the law gives credit reporting agencies the ability to sell personal information of business owners, she said.</p><p>Some of the conflict has to do with how Mactaggart wrote the CPRA in consultation with the tech industry. As Issie Lapowsky wrote in Protocol, at least half a dozen provisions in the initiative trace directly back to Mactaggart's private negotiations with companies including Google and Facebook. (Google and Facebook haven't taken an official stand on the CPRA.)</p><p>Mactaggart said he brought a draft of the proposition to a coalition of privacy advocates and addressed 27 of their 41 concerns. Jacob Snow, of the ACLU of Northern California, told me Mactaggart actually made a \"single digit\" number of pro-privacy changes. </p><p>\"What you see are a lot of new provisions that are favorable to big tech companies, and provisions that add privacy protections are weak,\" he said.

It's pitting privacy advocates against . . . checking my notes . . . other privacy advocates?          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, also known as the CPRA, is being pushed by one of the authors of - and is supposed to improve upon - the state's existing California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took  effect this year. The CCPA gives consumers the ability to opt out of the sale of some of our information, but demands we jump through a lot of hoops to protect our privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So I was surprised to discover the battle lines emerging over the new CPRA, which has the American Civil Liberties Union aligned with corporate archenemies, including data brokers and the online ad industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fight is not only creating strange bedfellows, but\u202fthe proposition's murky language leaves lots of confusion for voters come November.</p><p>My takeaway: The CPRA isn't the aggressive battle with big tech some privacy advocates wanted and won't introduce a new paradigm for how California protects data rights.</p><p>But it makes enough changes to existing law - which stays in place if the proposition fails -  that it could alter the balance of power with data-hungry corporations. There's just little agreement on whether those changes are, added up, better for consumers or corporations - or just kind of a wash. And whatever California does on privacy could end up becoming a floor for data rights across the country, because it's hard for companies to treat Californians differently.</p><p>The CPRA shows how messy privacy policy can become when advocates themselves can't agree on how hard to push, or who gets to lead the charge. That should be a warning to other states considering privacy laws, as well as those hoping for a federal one.</p><p>Driving and funding the CPRA is Alastair Mactaggart, a real estate developer who, as an outsider among privacy advocates, played a big role in getting the CCPA passed in 2018. Mactaggart also helped finance the CCPA initially as a ballot proposition but compromised to get a version passed by the state legislature instead.</p><p>Mactaggart told me his motivation for launching the CPRA was to fix problems with the CCPA.</p><p>As a ballot initiative that can only be overturned by another one, he said the CPRA would become \"a baseline for privacy law that can't be weakened.\" A provision in Proposition 24 allows the legislature to amend it, but only for purposes \"to enhance privacy and [that] are consistent with and further the purposes and intent of this Act.\"</p><p>The CPRA adds new limits on how businesses can use \"sensitive personal information\" - such as race, sexuality and precise location. Consumers would have to give their permission before such data could be sold. And it makes a big change to how the law gets enforced. Instead of relying on the California's attorney general, it creates a new data privacy agency and requires the state to fund it with at least $10 million. \"This would fund about 50 people,\" Mactaggart said. \"The [Federal Trade Commission] has 40 people for the entire nation\" to enforce privacy.</p><p>Fighting the CPRA is Mary Stone Ross, a former lawyer for the Electronic Privacy Information Center who also used to work with Mactaggart's Californians for Consumer Privacy and was a co-author of the original CCPA. She says the CPRA not only doesn't go far enough to improve the CCPA, but actually rolls back some of its protections. And her new organization, California Consumer and Privacy Advocates Against Prop 24, has gotten the support of a consortium including the ACLU, Color of Change, Media Alliance and the California Small Business Coalition.</p><p>Ross shared a laundry list of her problems with the new proposition. \"We can all agree there are awesome things that will move privacy forward, but hidden in the 52 pages are a lot of things that are going to move it backwards,\" she told me. For example, she says, even the language allowing for the CPRA to be modified could be used to harm future pro-privacy moves because it also stipulates that amendments should give \"attention to the impact on business and innovation.\"</p><p>Ross doesn't like that the CPRA would mean a delay in enforcement of the law as a new privacy agency gets set up, and that it has a carve-out in Proposition 24 for loyalty clubs, such as supermarket cards offering discounts in exchange for tracking purchases. She also doesn't like that the law gives credit reporting agencies the ability to sell personal information of business owners, she said.</p><p>Some of the conflict has to do with how Mactaggart wrote the CPRA in consultation with the tech industry. As Issie Lapowsky wrote in Protocol, at least half a dozen provisions in the initiative trace directly back to Mactaggart's private negotiations with companies including Google and Facebook. (Google and Facebook haven't taken an official stand on the CPRA.)</p><p>Mactaggart said he brought a draft of the proposition to a coalition of privacy advocates and addressed 27 of their 41 concerns. Jacob Snow, of the ACLU of Northern California, told me Mactaggart actually made a \"single digit\" number of pro-privacy changes. </p><p>\"What you see are a lot of new provisions that are favorable to big tech companies, and provisions that add privacy protections are weak,\" he said. He endorses the idea of a law requiring consumers to opt in to data collection, rather than opt out.</p><p>The fight has also gotten personal.</p><p>Last month, ahead of a meeting to determine whether the California Democratic Party would support the proposition, technical consultant to Mactaggart's organization Ashkan Soltani tweeted that \"the opposition campaign was orchestrated by a former CIA operative/scorned employee that intentionally misrepresented the #CPRA.\" Ross told me she was a CIA analyst earlier in her career, but was \"never an operative.\" </p><p>After lobbying by both sides, not enough state Democrats endorsed the proposition for it get the party's official approval. The California Republican Party opposes the ballot measure.</p><p>Ross said Mactaggart \"likes the initiative process because he can be the one in control of it - but it's not the process to use any more.\"</p><p>On that, Ross is in alignment with the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry association. \"To get it right, it is essential for new laws and regulations to undergo a process, with the ability for comment and debate,\" said Dave Grimaldi, the organization's executive vice president for public policy.</p><p>Data broker Acxiom also told me it was opposed to Proposition 24.</p><p>Ross said she's not opposed to taking money from the tech industry to fund her campaign against Proposition 24. \"In my mind, this initiative is so bad and I know I am going to need money to fight it,\" she said.</p><p>Some traditional privacy advocates are sitting out the CPRA.

If it weren't for the rise of social media, I bet a lot of people wouldn't. The reality is that you have to make decisions about online privacy every day: Will you use your real name as part of a username? Will you open the private mode on your browser so your website visits aren't tracked? Will you only visit sites that use HTTPS? Will you use a password management tool or stick to memorizing your logins?</p><p>Sometimes, the decisions are made for us, as in the case of the nearly 90 million Facebook users whose data was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Nancy Herther dives into the scandal and discusses how privacy and misinformation are handled by big tech companies (page 1). As she notes, the U.S. government is involved on a small scale--but the European Union has already released a new regulation designed to bring together data privacy law across the region. Kelly LeBlanc explains the major sections of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), lays out its misconceptions, and discusses the importance of complying with it (page 1).</p><p>When you do want to share online, it might be because it's research that you think others need to know (or can expand on).

As with many digital-age tools, it seems that adoption of these gadgets and their downloadable apps (short for applications) has outpaced understanding of them. </p><p>The industry, consumers and government officials still are in the early stages of balancing privacy issues with the need to allow features and innovation to flourish. Mobile apps can provide entertainment, keep people informed and save consumers money by allowing easy comparison shopping and tips on sales. But they also may be doing things users are not even aware of, such as gathering personal information or monitoring where the user is in order to provide data on nearby businesses. These things aren't necessarily bad, but they should be clearly disclosed to consumers, something that isn't happening consistently.</p><p>Recent research shows that more than a third of smartphone owners use comparison-shopping apps that identify stores close to their location. However, when they realize in the process that their phones are sending information about where they are and what they're doing, they may feel as if they're being stalked or watched by Big Brother. These concerns, when brought forth by lawmakers, can easily lead to overregulation. </p><p>In an effort to strike a balance, several governmental entities have begun working with companies and trade groups from the industry to come up with best practices and guidelines. These will provide a blueprint for how companies creating and supplying mobile apps will inform and protect consumers. </p><p>In California, which has stricter privacy laws than many states, Attorney General Kamala Harris announced an agreement last month with six big tech firms, including Amazon, Apple and Google, to mandate that they require all apps sold in their online stores have clear privacy policies. At the national level, the Federal Trade Commission has just issued a lengthy report outlining recommendations for privacy on digital platforms, including smartphones; the FTC is looking for voluntary buy-in from the industry, with the big stick of government regulation as a motivating tool. </p><p>Simplicity and transparency are key -- something as simple as a statement such as \"our app provides services based on your location,\" with an opt-in agreement and a clear, brief description of any other private data that might be used. Coming up with simple, standardized, plain-English notifications would best serve the interests of both business and the public.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLDIS-20231900</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLDIS2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:559D-D9G1-DYRX-02ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143930</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"433\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30312\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>March 31, 2012 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

BROTMAN Guest commentary</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The global tsunami of Big Tech company antitrust investigations finally has hit. The Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission and virtually all the states currently have initiated formal inquiries against Amazon, Facebook, and/or Google. Jurisdictional lines also are blurring, making these investigations either more efficient through information sharing or more unwieldy if turf battles break out regarding which agency has primary prosecutorial responsibilities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And further afield, the European Commission is continuing its antirust focus on the activities of these companies, eager to hear what U.S. antitrust enforcers are discovering.</p><p> A parallel track of Big Tech scrutiny, particularly in Congress, has been to hold a series of hearings on the effect of competition on data and privacy. The third conclave was held earlier this month by the House antitrust subcommittee, and more Big Tech company representatives can be expected to take their turns at the witness table in the coming weeks and months.</p><p> Down the road</p><p> The plethora of antitrust investigations are at early information-gathering stages. The issuance of subpoenas and outreach to Big Tech competitors who are eager to describe in detail how they have been disadvantaged in the marketplace by one or more tech Goliaths illustrates that these are serious pursuits. For now, the only certainty is that any antitrust cases that ultimately may be prosecuted  either by government lawyers or in civil class actions  will take years to be completed. The development of effective remedies is especially complex, even if the end result is either a consent decree or a settlement.</p><p> Meanwhile, Big Tech will continue to face serious scrutiny regarding consumer data collection, sharing and privacy practices. At a practical level, the antitrust investigations are likely to be in the spotlight as vast government and company resources are devoted to them. This makes sense, since the potential antitrust penalties range from multi-billion dollar fines to the more severe mandates of partial or complete corporate divestiture. Consequently, companies as well as Congress may move Big Tech data privacy issues to the back burner. Continuous hearings will keep the flame burning in this area, but they may not produce the type of distinct (and headline-grabbing) outcomes that are possible when the Sherman Act and comparable state laws are employed.</p><p> Consumer protection</p><p> This dynamic is not beneficial to millions of American consumers who may view digital privacy as a higher priority than government oversight of Big Tech competition. That\u2019s because Big Tech companies, regardless of their size or dominance in the marketplace, are unlikely to adopt privacy practices that others can or will follow. The antitrust laws actually are working against consumer interests by not allowing the largest Big Tech companies to share perspectives on privacy protection measures that they are developing or that already have been put in place.</p><p> Counterintuitively, for privacy it would be better public policy for Big Tech companies to be permitted to assemble their own big tent where they can begin discussing collectively their data collection, sharing and privacy protection regimes. Here, unlike in the antitrust realm, Congress has a central role to play.</p><p> It is possible to separate the antirust and privacy concerns in a manner that does not impede the competition investigations. This would take the form of a narrow, time-specific (18- to 24-month) antitrust exemption for the specific purpose of having these companies develop workable consumer data privacy protocols that could be implemented voluntarily on an across-the-board basis throughout the digital ecosystem, rather than in piecemeal fashion.</p><p>Big Tech immunity</p><p>Big Tech companies already may have antitrust immunity, based on prior judicial rulings, from working together to influence any consumer data privacy policy that may be created in the near future. And Congress already has enacted a series of expansive laws exempting Big Sports (Major League Baseball and the National Football League), Big Newspapers (the Newspaper Preservation Act), and Big Insurers (the McCann-Ferguson Act) from antitrust liability writ large. This means that any potential political blowback for enacting a Big Tech antitrust exemption would be cushioned by ample legal precedent.</p><p> My proposal is more modest, with a short-enough sunset period to see if results would be forthcoming. Such an antitrust exemption would be beneficial to Big Tech, too, if it was able to show how joint action provided a workable privacy self-regulatory model, thus making legislation less necessary. On a public perception level, Big Tech also would be able to score some consumer brownie points by developing a suite of privacy solutions that could take hold sooner rather than later.</p><p> While the storm rages</p><p>Congress has the legislative authority to enact a limited antitrust exemption for Big Tech on privacy, but it will need to obtain the support of the Department of Justice to do so. Such a two-step process is welcomed, since Justice will be vigilant in ensuring that any exemption not impede the scores of antitrust investigations already under way. In effect, this exemption would enable the tsunami to continue at full force while simultaneously creating some possibility of better consumer data privacy protection.</p><p> Admittedly, the legislative details of my proposed antitrust exemption will need to be developed with greater specificity, along with sensitivity to the joint action boundaries it would establish.</p><p> Although consumer privacy protection would be the ultimate goal, the exemption would not guarantee that Big Tech companies would work together to use their combined economies of scale and scope for the public good. But moving in this direction would provide an effective route forward in at least one major area of political and social concern about Big Tech\u2019s ever-expanding reach into the daily activities of our lives.</p><p> Stuart N.

Adrian Weckler asks her about dealings with Facebook, fines, national identity cards and US spies Adrian Weckler [AW]: A criticism your office - and that of your predecessor Billy Hawke - has faced over the years is that it adopts a collaborative or consultative role with the biggest tech companies in Ireland like Facebook and Google compared with other data protection regimes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Helen Dixon [HD]: I'd go further by saying that I don't think there's anything wrong with a consultative approach. I would go so far as to say it's absolutely necessary. And this is well-documented in terms of theory of regulation, and particularly in relation to regulation that's based on a principles-based framework law.</p><p>The academic Julia Black, from the London School of Economics, talks about something called regulatory conversations. And regulatory conversations are absolutely essential, in terms of allowing organisations to set out their understanding of the principles, define the very specific circumstances in which they need to apply those principles of data protection law and seek guidance from the regulator in relation to how they're applying the principles. So, even Article 29, which is the grouping of European data protection authorities, has moved now in this direction of consultation.</p><p>In fact, the general data protection regulation obliges the successor to Article 29, the new European Data Protection Board, to consult. So consultation is absolutely necessary because otherwise you have just got very generic and laudable principles ,but you've no means of applying them to the real world.</p><p>AW: But what about specific services or specific new features that a company like Facebook will want to introduce? They may want to see whether it will pass muster with their lead European regulator. Does this happen and how often does it happen? HD: It does happen and it happens very regularly with the big companies that we supervise. As I said to you before, they're going through so many mergers and acquisitions, they're adding new, big and significant products at the rate of knots in some cases. So we have very frequent contacts with these companies over the last year, especially in the roll up to GDPR. There are all sorts of examples.</p><p>So they may consult us, and our consulting is currently in relation to their new transparency notices, their privacy notices, how they're going to display them on different devices. And they will take all sorts of guidance and feedback from us in relation to whether we think it hits the mark that the GDPR intended, whether the notice is too inaccessible at any point as an individual navigates the service, whether there is insufficient information provided up-front and too much being left for in context notices to the user. So, we're providing that sort of feedback on an ongoing basis.</p><p>AW: Last year, you spoke of increased resources and an eventual doubling of your office's headcount. Since then, though, we've had massive expansion in the tech companies already here and dozens more big tech firms arrive. And then there's the GDPR coming in May. Do you have what you require? HD: We should have about 140 people by the end of this year. Our budget has more than quadrupled, up to (EURO)11.7m this year. So we have been building and building, not just in terms of numbers of staff but with some specialist recruitment. We've recruited very key new members to our legal team, our technology team and in skills that we didn't have - such as business analytics.</p><p>AW: So is that enough? HD: Well it's important to point out that we're now among the top tier of highly-resourced data protection authorities in the EU in terms of resourcing, the annual budget that we have to deploy and in terms of the number of staff that we have. So we're behind the UK, France and Germany in terms of numbers, but we're up there just in the tier right below them. The UK Data Protection Authority is the biggest data protection authority in the world.</p><p>AW: Surely with the companies located here, that's the way it should be? HD: Yes. As for data protection authorities in Europe, in the last survey that I saw, they averaged about 68 staff so they're not huge. And the question of whether they're resourced adequately is a question really for the member states in Europe. Is this the importance that a member state attaches to the regulatory and supervision role under the GDPR? And are we all adequately resourced? I would say no and I would say no data protection authority has enough resources in terms of the importance we would attach to the issues that fall out of personal data processing and the types of risks and harms that can occur for individuals in terms of discrimination, identity theft, loss of reputation and unfair decision-making.</p><p>So we will be making the case to add further resources and particularly in the circumstances, as you say, that in Ireland we're supervising the biggest internet companies in the world. And equally, I would think there's a case for elevating the resources of data protection authorities across the EU.</p><p>AW: One of the biggest global data breaches in recent years was Yahoo, where three billion email accounts were compromised. As that company has its international office here, you had said your office would investigate. What is the status of that investigation? HD: Yes, we did conduct an investigation in relation to that very largescale Yahoo breach, or two breaches in fact. The controller for European users is located in Ireland. Under the Irish Data Protection Acts, the obligations on that controller based in Ireland where it was transferring the data back to Yahoo Inc in the US, was to ensure that the processor, being Yahoo Inc in the US, had appropriate safeguards in place to safeguard and secure the data.</p><p>The breaches in this case occurred from Yahoo Inc in the US rather from the Dublin-based controller. And so we have conducted a lengthy investigation over the last year in relation to the measures that were in place, the active oversight that was taken by the controller in Ireland over what safeguards were put in place by the processor. And we're just at the concluding stages of the report and the findings and we're serving that on Yahoo EMEA in Ireland.</p><p>AW: So that's imminent? HD: That's imminent.</p><p>AW: In the US, courts are clearing the way for individual citizens to sue Yahoo over the data breach. In a post-GDPR environment, is that the kind of thing that might happen here? If another Yahoo were to happen, or indeed if people are only discovering now about their Yahoo accounts being hacked, could we see individual citizens taking legal action on that basis here? HD: I think we certainly could see individuals taking legal action on that basis.</p><p>It would, of course, be a matter entirely for the courts in Ireland then to assess what quantum would be put on compensation or whether the breach was merely technical. In other words, whether there was a threat of access to the accounts but the loss was mitigated substantially by the company once the breach was discovered, or whether there has been actual loss and consequences suffered by the individuals.</p><p>So, that will be for the courts to assess the nature and the gravity of the loss for individuals and then to put a quantum in terms of compensation, if any, they would award.</p><p>AW: But in Ireland we don't really have a history of class-action suits.</p><p>HD: No, and there won't be class actions in Ireland under the GDPR either.</p><p>AW: Yahoo argued that it could be an attack by a nation state. Other big companies in the same situation try to plead the same reason as a get-out-of jail card, arguing that they can't be expected to compete with the cyberwarfare resources of rogue states. Will the GDPR do anything to change the basis of arguing that excuse? HD: You're right, we hear a lot about these state-sponsored actors that are alleged to be behind some of these larger-scale breaches, particularly as concerns internet and infrastructure companies. It won't, per se, be a get-out-of-jail card. So, where a breach has occurred and it's not contested that it has occurred, they'll likely be a presumption of an infringement of the GDPR in those circumstances.</p><p>But when we come to look under Article 83 of the GDPR at what sanction we would apply, it sets out a number of mitigation criteria which we would be obliged to take into account. One of the other things we would have to take into account is whether the controller had applied every last safeguard, state-of-the-art security measures and taken every conceivable action possible.</p><p>We haven't, I suppose, come across a company to date in the course of our investigations where we could say 'Well, they've had stateof-the-art processes and systems and taken every last action that was possible', but the theoretical possibility is there.</p><p>AW: Even with all those billion-dollar multinational companies with all the resources they have? HD: As I said, it's a theoretical possibility that if they have applied objectively demonstrable state-ofthe-art security and there really appears to have been nothing further they could have done, that would certainly be a mitigation criteria. But, we haven't come across it.</p><p>You'll have seen in the annual report that we published recently for 2017 that, particularly in relation to medium-sized organisations, we're still seeing basic cybersecurity hygiene that's very poor in a lot of cases. This is the failure to keep systems and patches updated, poor password-setting, failure to use all of the layered authentication options that are available and leaving systems set at their default settings.</p><p>AW: The public services card has proven to be controversial, with some charging that it's a national identity card by stealth. It seems that public bodies are starting to ask for it when we apply for state documents, such as passports. What's your view? HD: We have an investigation under way in relation to the public services card which we launched late last year. What triggered us to launch the investigation was that it suddenly became prevalent for it to be mandatory to produce the public services card to the exclusion of any other form of identity for a whole range of government services, including the driver theory test now incoming, the driver's licence, the passport and so on. And so we sought to open an investigation to look at what the legal basis for the public services card is and to look at the legal basis for compelling it to the exclusion of any other form of identity in relation to the procuring of services from the State.</p><p>We also want to look at what its transparency to the public is in relation to what's being collected, what type of data is on the card, what precisely it's being used for and with what type of government agencies it's being shared with. It seemed to us, from queries that we were receiving to our office, that there wasn't sufficient transparency and so we opened an investigation to look at the range of these issues. The first principles of data protection are lawful and fair processing and we're really going back to first principles with this investigation.</p><p>When Irish Water was established there were a number of Irish Water Services acts and it was immediately obvious if you read those acts how the database for Irish Water was being formed, by collecting data from a number of different government databases. But with this particular implementation and rollout by government, it's not immediately apparent for a member of the public where you'd go to look if you were curious and wanted to understand the law underpinning it.</p><p>The law is spread over a number of pieces of primary legislation, social welfare legislation and a number of pieces of secondary legislation in some cases. But it's not enough to have a legal basis, you have to be very transparent and clear with the public as to why the data is being collected. And it would also be necessarily to justify why a certain form of identity, to the exclusion of any other form of identity, is necessary in the circumstances.</p><p>AW: We are talking about the public sector in government services. If Ryanair or Aer Lingus or other big private organisations start accepting it as a means of identification, or pubs or nightclubs start accepting it, it kind of becomes a runaway thing on its own doesn't it? And whether or not it's required for public sector use, if every single big organisation accepts it as an alternative to a driver's licence or a passport, eventually the public sector will probably accept it as well, right? HD: I suppose you're getting into speculation that's beyond the scope of the investigation we're conducting. But what I would say is that you talked about alternatives. One of the points we're looking at is the fact that alternatives are not being recognised, it's mandatory to the exclusion of any currently known alternatives. That becomes the point that is significant.</p><p>AW: Isn't there a basic issue of taste here, too? In continental Europe, many countries don't have any problem with a national identity card. It's regarded as a fact of life that makes administration more efficient. Is it our common law heritage that makes us more suspicious of the notion of a national identity card? Is it a dislike of being stopped in the street and being asked to produce papers? HD: You're right, there are national identity cards in the vast majority of EU member states. And, in many cases, they have that characteristic that they have to be carried at all times. And so in common law countries like New Zealand, the UK and Ireland there has, as you said, always been a view that's opposed to national identity cards. That's not the aim of our investigation. It's not the role of the Data Protection Authority to dictate what government policy should or shouldn't be, but to the extent that a card of this nature, and the SAFE 2 registration system itself, involves the collection and processing and sharing of significant amounts of personal data, it must be lawfully collected and there must be transparency about it.</p><p>AW: There has also been a lot of commentary about Privacy Shield, the successor EU-US agreement to Safe Harbour, which was struck down by the European Court of Justice for not adequately protecting our European personal data rights. The European group of data protection authorities that you're a member of has been critical of Privacy Shield and has sought clarification on the US side with regard to an ombudsman and other matters. Hasn't it gone so far as to suggest that this treaty might follow Safe Harbour in being referred again to the European Court if nothing happens? HD: Yes, the appointment of a permanent person in that position is one of the issues. We're still in discussions and waiting to hear updates in relation to progress from the US authorities. That will happen and we'll get something of an update in the next couple of weeks and then it will be a matter for reviewing. I think, incidentally, what that statement from Article 29 said, in relation to a referral to the CJEU was that a national data-protection authority would bring a matter before its national courts.</p><p>AW: So that could be you, bringing it before the High Court here? HD: It could, I suppose.</p><p>AW: Will it be you? HD: It's probably not useful to speculate at this point until we get an update from the US authorities and look at where the various deficiencies that were identified are at.</p><p>AW: One of the underlying issues, surely, is US authorities continuing to harvest European citizens' personal data though, isn't it? Do we really believe that's going to stop? And assuming it isn't, doesn't Privacy Shield and any successor face difficult odds? HD: As you know, we took a case in the Irish High Court in relation to another mechanism for transfers, the standard contractual clauses case which is used not just to transfer to the US but to other third countries. Justice Caroline Costello agreed with the position we took when she issued her judgement on the 3rd of October last year and agreed to make a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to the validity of those clauses. And she conducted a hearing in January of this year with the various parties to the case including Max Schrems, Facebook, our office and other participants in terms of formulating the questions.</p><p>I think some of those questions around surveillance access and then the appropriate safeguards that have to be in place when data is being transferred will fall out of that case once the reference is made. We anticipate it is likely to be this month when Justice Costello will make the reference.</p><p>AW: But are we being a little naive in thinking that the CIA and NSA are going to stop tapping into our data streams? HD: I suppose I have to be careful because we conduct investigations into these types of issues and we have to follow fair procedures and due process and adduce the facts as they exist. So I don't really want to comment along the lines that you're suggesting. But I suppose what I would say, which probably concurs really with the point you are making, is that there's likely to be a need not just for litigation in these cases, bringing the matters to the CJEU, but also a need for political solutions as well as legal solutions to make transfers sustainable and balanced against rights of individuals in the longer term.</p><p>AW: Is there an issue with privacy law keeping up with technology? HD: I think the GDPR is going to go a long way in that direction. One key thing for us in terms of these companies that monetise personal data is the issue of transparency.</p><p>There has always been the complaint that users aren't entirely clear that that is the deal. We're talking to the big companies about layered privacy notices, better visualisation capability for users in terms of data that's being collected and how it's going to be used.</p><p>But there are a huge amount of players. Whatever about the big companies like Google and Facebook, who write blogs and discuss their processes, there are other players in ad tech where we just don't have that visibility. There are more nefarious operators, individuals we aren't aware of. So there's a whole issue around surfacing up what is going on in that space and trying to rationalise it in some way, so that ultimately the individual service user has some transparency and control which undoubtedly they don't at the moment. If we visit one website we may discover we've been connected with 24 other websites based on cookies that are dropped.</p><p>We expect to see a marked change in how transparency is done by these internet companies under GDPR and we're waiting for the big reveal from a lot of them.</p><p>Editor's note: this interview was conducted before the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data controversy.

The situation has escalated in recent months, with judges on both sides of the pond making life increasingly difficult for these companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For instance, in one case that has drawn widespread attention, U.S. Judge Loretta Preska on July 31 ordered Microsoft Corp.to comply with a search warrant made by an unnamed U.S. law enforcement agency. If the ruling is upheld, it would force <person><nameText>Microsoft </nameText></person>to disclose emails stored abroad, namely on the company's data servers in Ireland.</p><p>The ruling would mean data from any <person><nameText>Microsoft </nameText></person>user, including Europeans who made data available to <person><nameText>Microsoft, </nameText></person>could be subject to U.S. search warrants, even if the data has no direct relation to the U.S.</p><p>\"It is a question of control, not a question of the location of that information,\" Preska said in her ruling.</p><p>This has raised concerns in Europe about how the ruling might apply to other tech companies that often handle personal data, such as Apple Inc., Google, Yahoo! Inc., Facebook, Amazon.com Inc. and Twitter Inc.</p><p>Preska's stance is not unreasonable. In an increasingly digital world, traditional jurisdictions fade and Web activities transcend borders, so in order to maintain some sort of Web regulation, the country where a company is headquartered could take control. Perhaps more importantly, if Preska had ruled otherwise, it could have allowed Americans to hide emails and other digital information from U.S. authorities simply by storing it abroad.</p><p>The order was temporarily suspended to allow <person><nameText>Microsoft </nameText></person>to file an appeal despite objections from the U.S. Department of Justice, which called for immediate enforcement. <person><nameText>Microsoft </nameText></person>challenged the legality of the search warrant on the basis that since the requested emails were stored outside the U.S., the information was beyond the jurisdiction of a U.S. search warrant. The company's lawyers further argued that handing over data held in Europe would violate international law and treaties.</p><p><person><nameText>Microsoft </nameText></person>could be right. EU laws and regulations state that special precautions need to be taken when personal data is transferred out of the EU, which is permitted only when an adequate level of protection is guaranteed. More importantly, European authorities have repeatedly said that, regardless of where a company is headquartered, European subsidiaries must abide by European laws.</p><p>So, for the big U.S. tech companies, complying at home could result in a breach of European data protection rules, which inevitably would lead to regulatory measures and possible fines. This leaves tech giants caught in the middle of conflicting directives from regulators in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p><person><nameText>Microsoft, </nameText></person>Facebook and Googlehave faced enormous public mistrust in recent years over their perceived inability to protect Europeans' privacy and personal data from U.S. authorities, particularly following revelations about U.S. spy initiatives as leaked by former U.S. government contractor Edward Snowden. Preska's ruling will further erode that trust and might even damage U.S. tech companies' European business over time.</p><p>The outrage over Snowden's disclosures has not yet diminished in Europe. Allegations that Facebook supports U.S. surveillance programs are even included in a civil lawsuit regarding alleged data privacy violations by Facebook in Europe. The lawsuit was filed at the Commercial Court in Vienna, Austria, against Facebook's Irish subsidiary.</p><p>With the claim for damages set at (EURO)500 per user, the pending Facebook case has the potential to become Europe's largest data privacy suit ever. The lawsuit argues that Facebook is engaged in a number of unlawful policies and practices, including with its data use policy, consent practices, tracking of users' external Internet activity, transmission of data to external applications, support of U.S. surveillance programs, and introduction of Graph Search. The complaint pretty much sums up all the objections that Europeans have against data processing practices at the big tech firms.</p><p>Lawyers are convinced that the Facebook lawsuit might become the ultimate test case. It represents an opportunity for Europeans to restate their approach to privacy, namely that no data can be shared or transferred without adequate checks and balances. If the Vienna court does indeed rule in favor of the claimants in the Facebook suit, it will, once again, lay bare the fundamentally different approach to privacy in the U.S. and EU.</p><p>However, in the long term, this could eventually force the European Union and the U.S. to enter into talks regarding their varying regulations. The U.S. could push for a simplification of European rules, while the EU might seek an easing of enforcement of a range of U.S. laws that could force U.S. companies to share information held in Europe with U.S. authorities.</p><p>One does not need to be a legal scholar to see the current maze of conflicting regulation for multinational tech companies as an undesirable and unsustainable way of regulating the global Web.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-28874881</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D0C-8S11-F19Y-C2R4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp; Communications Report</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>August 19, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001T6V</classCode><className>YAHOO!

In January, French regulators fined Google a record $80 million for failing to provide web users with transparent and understandable information on data use.</p><p>Big tech operators that refuse to co-operate with the Australian Information Commissioner or those that fail to change their behaviour will face additional penalties.</p><p>With an election due in May the new laws are unlikely to pass parliament before polling day, meaning Labor will be under pressure to reveal whether it will deliver the new system if elected.</p><p>Mr Morrison is meeting with the tech giants in Canberra amid a global backlash following the spread of graphic vision of the Christchurch shootings, in which 50 people died.</p><p>\"Social media companies have built the technology, created the platform and therefore have a responsibility to the millions of Australians who use their services every day to keep them safe,\" Mr Morrison said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:annika.smethurst@news.com.au\">annika.smethurst@news.com.au</email></p><p>The web has created opportunity, given marginalised groups a voice and made our daily lives easier, it has also created opportunity for scammers, given a platform to those who spread hatred and made all kinds of crime easier to commitTIM BERNERS-LEE, WORLD WIDE WEB CREATOR, OPINION, P56</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-ca247bae4c2d11e9abec0a1503f26727b4f43d9a09ac6ef87c1b50e2b85d3668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR0-3KM1-F0JP-W49B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSun2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 24, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Expressions of outrage follow, and regulators promise to investigate.</p><p>This sounds like the leak of Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica. But it also describes this week\u2019s portrayal by the media of US healthcare provider Ascension\u2019s decision to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\"> hand the records</url> of 50m of its patients to Google.</p><p>In reality, this is far from the scandal it was painted. But the huge attention it has received points to both the risks and opportunities as large troves of valuable data are moved, wholesale, to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/understanding-cloud-computing\"> cloud</url>. How this information is handled, and who reaps the value from it, are questions that will stir much wider concern.</p><p>As it turned out, Ascension had signed a fairly standard cloud deal with Google for its patient data to be stored and processed. This is no different to the arrangements companies in many industries have reached with public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft. Had Ascension contracted instead with IBM \u2014 and if a few dozen IBM workers, rather than Googlers, were able to see patients\u2019 personal data \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t have caused a stir.</p><p>This points to a particular problem for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/d6b12f0c-bf3f-4045-a07b-1e4e49103fd6\">Google</url> as it tries to build a cloud computing business. The heightened attention to the vast amount of data it already holds to support its consumer advertising business prompts inevitable questions about how information belonging to companies such as Ascension is treated. No one asks whether a company\u2019s data are adequately ringfenced when it is held in the IBM or Microsoft clouds.</p><p>That US health information laws, dating from before the internet era, are widely considered loose does not help. Nor does the fact that Google has already been faulted for its handling of personal data about a large population of patients, over the way DeepMind was able to access National Health Service data in the UK.</p><p>This week an FT investigation also revealed that some highly personal health information that internet users enter on websites was being transmitted to Google\u2019s advertisers, raising further questions.</p><p>A bigger question from deals like this, meanwhile, concerns the amount of extra value that could be created by holding data in the cloud. Applying machine learning \u2014 and, potentially, pooling some of the information with data from other sources \u2014 could yield important insights. How should that value be shared out between patients, healthcare companies and their technology providers?</p><p>For Ascension, one attraction of using Google is that the internet company will be able to supply useful new diagnostic and organisational tools to medical staff. This echoes other deals that could reshape the health sector, such as Novartis\u2019s recent agreement with Microsoft, tapping that company\u2019s artificial intelligence technology to make more use of its data. Companies, naturally enough, want to keep the value in these insights to themselves, and say they will use it to benefit their patient populations.</p><p>Google, on the other hand, has not been secret about its own desires to bring the benefits of better healthcare information to the public at large. A specialised health search engine, or a personal digital assistant that could give accurate answers to your health concerns, would be hugely valuable \u2014 both for the internet company and the billions of people who use its services. This creates one more complication for Google as it tries to build both an enterprise-grade cloud business and mass consumer services in the same company.</p><p>Companies turning to the cloud also face questions about how best to reap value from their data, while ensuring their patients remain the main beneficiaries. Applying new AI tools to patient data they already hold presents the first opportunity. In the field of cardiovascular medicine, for instance, Novartis has a mass of data drawn, over the past decade, from trials involving 100,000 patients. A data set of that scale is a considerable asset.</p><p>But if the ultimate promise of personalised medicine is a treatment designed for each individual, then analysing smaller patient populations to reach more revealing insights will eventually become a necessity. Some pooling of information, and the creation of more open data sets, will become key.</p><p>For now few companies are likely to see the merit in sharing their data with others \u2014 whether that means a rival in their own industry or a Google. The Californian analytics company Palantir, for instance, tried to broker a partnership between big consumer product groups, with a view to pooling all their consumer data that wasn\u2019t considered of key strategic significance. It failed.</p><p>The era of more open data is still some way off. For now, companies \u2014 and their tech suppliers \u2014 need to show they are trustworthy stewards of customer data. Being more open about what they are actually doing, and how it fits into their wider ambitions, would be a start.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-a2afd690070311eaa984fbbacad9e7dd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH7-NH01-DXP9-91GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The populist push got a bump with the New York Times coverage[1] of Lina Khan's 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox[2]' in which she advocated breaking up Amazon and applying public utility regulation to platforms. Khan's ideas were picked up by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has a plan for similar public utility regulation and promised[3] to unwind earlier acquisitions by Amazon (Whole Foods and Zappos), Facebook (WhatsApp and Instagram), and Google (Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick).Khan, Warren, and the other Break Up Big Tech populists don't clearly articulate how consumers, suppliers \u2014 or anyone for that matter \u2014 would be better off with their mandated spinoffs. </p><p>The Khan/Warren plan, however, requires a unique alignment of many factors: Warren must win the White House, Democrats must control both houses of Congress, and judges must substantially shift their thinking. It's like turning a supertanker[4] on a dime in the middle of a storm. Instead of publishing manifestos[5] and engaging in antitrust hashtag[6] hipsterism, maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 the populists can do something.The populists seem to have three main grievances: Small firms cannot enter the market or cannot thrive once they enter;Suppliers, including workers, are getting squeezed; andSpeculation that someday firms will wake up, realize they have a monopoly, and begin charging noncompetitive prices to consumers. Each of these grievances can be, and has been, already addressed by antitrust and competition litigation. And, in many cases these grievances were addressed in private antitrust litigation. For example: Leegin v. PSKS[7], private antitrust litigation alleging anticompetitive vertical price restraints ;Weyerhaeuser v. Ross-Simmons[8], private antitrust litigation alleging predatory bidding of inputs;Apple v. Pepper[9], private antitrust litigation that chipped away at Illinois Brick's[10] indirect purchaser doctrine; andThe European Commission's Google Search[11] investigation was prompted by complaints filed by a private party, Foundem[12]. In the US, private actions are available for a wide range of alleged anticompetitive conduct, including coordinated conduct (e.g., price-fixing), single-firm conduct (e.g., predatory pricing), and mergers that would substantially lessen competition.If the antitrust populists are so confident that concentration is rising and firms are behaving anticompetitively and consumers/suppliers/workers are being harmed, then why don't they organize an antitrust lawsuit against the worst of the worst violators? If anticompetitive activity is so obvious and so pervasive, finding compelling cases should be easy.For example, earlier this year, Shaoul Sussman, a law student at Fordham University, published 'Prime Predator: Amazon and the Rationale of Below Average Variable Cost Pricing Strategies Among Negative-Cash Flow Firms[13]' in the Journal of Antitrust Enforcement. Why not put Sussman's theory to the test by building an antitrust case around it? The discovery process would unleash a treasure trove of cost data and probably more than a few 'hot docs.'Khan argues:While predatory pricing technically remains illegal, it is extremely difficult to win predatory pricing claims because courts now require proof that the alleged predator would be able to raise prices and recoup its losses.However, in her criticism of the court in the Apple e-books[14] litigation, she lays out a clear rationale for courts to revise their thinking on predatory pricing [emphasis added]:Judge Cote, who presided over the district court trial, refrained from affirming the government's conclusion. Still, the government's argument illustrates the dominant framework that courts and enforcers use to analyze predation\u2014and how it falls short. Specifically, the government erred by analyzing the profitability of Amazon's e-book business in the aggregate and by characterizing the conduct as 'loss leading' rather than potentially predatory pricing. These missteps suggest a failure to appreciate two critical aspects of Amazon's practices: (1) how steep discounting by a firm on a platform-based product creates a higher risk that the firm will generate monopoly power than discounting on non-platform goods and (2) the multiple ways Amazon could recoup losses in ways other than raising the price of the same e-books that it discounted.Why not put Khan's cross-subsidy theory to the test by building an antitrust case around it? Surely there'd be a document explaining how the firm expects to recoup its losses. Or, maybe not. Maybe by the firm's accounting, it's not losing money on the discounted products. Without evidence, it's just speculation.In fairness, one can argue that recent court decisions have made pursuing private antitrust litigation more difficult. For example, the Supreme Court's decision in Twombly[15] requires an antitrust plaintiff to show more than mere speculation based on circumstantial evidence in order to move forward to discovery. Decisions in matters such as Ashcroft v. Iqbal[16] have made it more difficult for plaintiffs to maintain antitrust claims. Wal-Mart v. Dukes[17] and Comcast Corp v Behrend[18] subject antitrust class actions to more rigorous analysis. In Ohio v. Amex[19] the court ruled antitrust plaintiffs can't meet the burden of proof by showing only some effect[20] on some part of a two-sided market.At the same time Jeld-Wen[21] indicates third party plaintiffs can be awarded damages and obtain divestitures, even after mergers clear. In Jeld-Wen, a competitor filed suit to challenge the consummated Jeld-Wen/Craftmaster merger four years after the DOJ approved the merger without conditions. The challenge was lengthy, but successful, and a district court ordered damages and the divestiture of one of the combined firm's manufacturing facilities six years after the merger was closed. Despite the possible challenges of pursuing a private antitrust suit, Daniel Crane's review[22] of US federal court workload statistics concludes the incidence of private antitrust enforcement in the United States has been relatively stable since the mid-1980s \u2014 in the range of 600 to 900 new private antitrust filings a year. He also finds resolution by trial has been relatively stable at an average of less than 1 percent a year. Thus, it's not clear that recent decisions have erected insurmountable barriers to antitrust plaintiffs.In the US, third parties may fund private antitrust litigation and plaintiffs' attorneys are allowed to work under a contingency fee arrangement, subject to court approval. A compelling case could be funded by deep-pocketed supporters of the populists' agenda, big tech haters, or even investors. Perhaps the most well-known example is Peter Thiel's bankrolling[23] of Hulk Hogan's takedown of Gawker. Before that, the savings and loan crisis led to a number of forced mergers which were later challenged in court, with the costs partially funded by the issuance of litigation tracking warrants[24].The antitrust populist ranks are chock-a-block with economists, policy wonks, and go-getter attorneys. If they are so confident in their claims of rising concentration, bad behavior, and harm to consumers, suppliers, and workers, then they should put those ideas to the test with some slam dunk litigation. The fact that they haven't suggests they may not have a case.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2Fprivate-antitrust-what-hipsters-can-learn-from-hulk-hogan%2F...kname=Private%20Antitrust%3A%20What%20Hipsters%20Can%20Learn%20from%20Hulk%20Hoganhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2Fprivate-antitrust-what-hipsters-can-learn-from-hulk-hogan%2F...kname=Private%20Antitrust%3A%20What%20Hipsters%20Can%20Learn%20from%20Hulk%20Hoganhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2Fprivate-antitrust-what-hipsters-can-learn-from-hulk-hogan%2F...kname=Private%20Antitrust%3A%20What%20Hipsters%20Can%20Learn%20from%20Hulk%20Hoganhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2Fprivate-antitrust-what-hipsters-can-learn-from-hulk-hogan%2F...le=Private%20Antitrust%3A%20What%20Hipsters%20Can%20Learn%20from%20Hulk%20HoganThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2Fprivate-antitrust-what-hipsters-can-learn-from-hulk-hogan%2F...kname=Private%20Antitrust%3A%20What%20Hipsters%20Can%20Learn%20from%20Hulk%20Hoganhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2Fprivate-antitrust-what-hipsters-can-learn-from-hulk-hogan%2F...kname=Private%20Antitrust%3A%20What%20Hipsters%20Can%20Learn%20from%20Hulk%20Hoganhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2Fprivate-antitrust-what-hipsters-can-learn-from-hulk-hogan%2F...kname=Private%20Antitrust%3A%20What%20Hipsters%20Can%20Learn%20from%20Hulk%20Hoganhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F11%2F21%2Fprivate-antitrust-what-hipsters-can-learn-from-hulk-hogan%2F...le=Private%20Antitrust%3A%20What%20Hipsters%20Can%20Learn%20from%20Hulk%20HoganThe</url> post Private Antitrust: What Hipsters Can Learn from Hulk Hogan[25] appeared first on Truth on the Market[26].

many of whom had flown in from the US, Africa, continental Europe and Asia - gathered at the FT building in London for a midsummer's evening ceremony to celebrate PWM's Wealth Tech Awards for 2019 at the end of June.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the evening celebrations were preceded by an in-depth afternoon roundtable discussion, which brought together digital leaders from some of the winning banks and digital transformation consultants from the judging panel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our road map - marking the current digital scorecard, analysing challenges, identifying key innovations, assessing the role played by leaders in the transformation process and learning and partnering with other industries - was designed to provide some tentative guidance to help the private banking community in its quest for innovation and new ways of working.</p><p>CHALLENGES AND DRIVERS It quickly became apparent in our discussion that despite the claims of many banks to be innovators, digital transformation in private banking has progressed at a much slower rate than in other comparable industries, but there were good reasons for this.</p><p>\"I think banks have justifiable excuses for why things have not moved so quickly in the past 10 years,\" said Stephen Wall, co-founder of The Wealth Mosaic. \"These include regulation, the speed of change and the complexity of change being perhaps different from where the industry came from before.\"</p><p>The panellists agreed that there is no \"big bang\" or \"silver bullet\" in terms of digitalisation, but that the pace of innovation among private banks has accelerated in recent times, with a variety of projects in the laboratories, as banks continue to learn as they begin to gradually transform, step by step.</p><p>Structural factors, within their firms, were often restricting change, they argued. \"One of the biggest hurdles is the way firms are organised,\" said Alois Pirker, wealth management research director at the Aite Group. \"We often have a very segmented organisation that has their KPI [key performance indicators] to deliver on.\"</p><p>This means that a typically \"horizontal\" digitalisation strategy must cross multiple business lines, leading to some units gaining assets and others losing them, which is difficult for stakeholders to accept.</p><p>Tough times such as the financial crisis also test these expensive and intricate transformation strategies. \"I think it forces you to take a reality check on what that strategy is and why you are doing it and how imperative it actually is,\" said Phillip Watson, chief innovation officer at Citi Private Bank, which began its digital rebuild as early as 2007.</p><p>At the time of the crisis, the bank decided to carry on its programme for many reasons, which have become today's industry narrative, including growing wealth, its intergenerational transfer, alongside THE PARTICIPANTS Mario Bassi, independent wealth management consultant Urs Bolt, independent adviser, Bolt Now Kelli Keough, head of digital wealth management, JP Morgan Chase, New York Antonio Luna Vaz, CEO, BPI Private Banking, Lisbon Sharmil Patwa, founder, Opus Una Financial Services Consulting, London Alois Pirker, wealth management research director, Aite Group, Boston Mariam Rassai, head of client experience and digital transformation, BNP Paribas Wealth Management April Rudin, CEO, The Rudin Group Stephen Wall, co-founder, The Wealth Mosaic Phillip Watson, chief innovation officer, Citi Private Bank, London Yuri Bender, editor-in-chief, PWM (roundtable chairman) changing attitudes and expectations of clients.</p><p>For many banks in the industry, this transformation can go hand in hand with banks' need to manage volumes and margins and has to be managed accordingly, said Antonio Luna Vaz, head of private banking at Portuguese player BPI. \"The biggest concern for me is managing the efficiency of the relationship managers and how they spend their time,\" he said, measuring how much of this is spent onboarding clients and advising them.</p><p>\"You simply cannot afford to have a person with a (EURO)200m portfolio who spends 65 or 70 per cent of their time doing internal onboarding or managing clients. He has too many screens, too many data to process and then has to speak to a lot of people, not leaving any time for clients.\"</p><p>This means that banks will become less profitable if they fail to adjust and digitalise and reducing the mundane and onerous tasks which relationship managers have previously been burdened by is crucial to this process. \"Certainly technology has a part to play in increasing the amount of time the RMs can spend with clients,\" said Sharmil Patwa, founder of Opus Una Financial Services Consulting. Risk profiling, suitability, portfolio screening, portfolio management and curation of deal flows were all identified as areas which can be digitised with existing technology to create \"dramatic improvements\".</p><p>Indeed these changes are identified by the clients themselves as those contributing to their satisfaction levels, according to research conducted at JP Morgan Chase, where digital wealth management boss Kelli Keough has been responsible for the firm's reshaping.</p><p>\"Digital is the most important space for us to be focusing on in terms of improving their satisfaction,\" said Ms Keough. \"And that's of course a differentiated 'wow' experience, but even more importantly, it's removing the friction from day-to-day interactions with us.\"</p><p>It is these basics of interaction with clients which appear to be the most important to them, which is why banks such as JP Morgan have focused on building \"new platforms, new models, new experiences\".</p><p>But such initiatives will never be successful unless they are fully supported by relationship managers, along with the front office and internal service teams. \"They are the gatekeepers to your clients, especially in our relationship business,\" added Ms Keough.</p><p>Many new initiatives start off within banks' laboratories or innovations, but it seems only a handful of private banks include the client within the design process.</p><p>\"The starting point has to be understanding our client expectations,\" said Mariam Rassai, head of digital transformation and client experience at BNP Paribas Wealth Management. \"This is where we always start from and then designing the solution that will answer these expectations.\"</p><p>While much innovation concerns data-driven decision making, currently, we are still at an early stage in its gathering and analysis, believes Citi's Mr Watson.</p><p>\"We sit on so much more information and data today than ever before, and of course that is indisputable,\" he said. \"We are creating 2.5tn bytes every day, but that will pale into insignificance in just a few years, in even just a few months. I think our overall understanding of how we operate as humans is going to branch out in ways that probably we cannot altogether comprehend. But it's going to happen. And we are right at the very beginning of this.\"</p><p>The technology used to sift this data should increasingly be categorised around client needs rather than around the source of the innovation. \"When we look at our database, we don't put in the test of whether it is enabled by Cloud, or built using AI or machine learning or big data,\" said The Wealth Mosaic's Mr Wall. \"We look at what the outcomes are and what the business needs are.\"</p><p>This pigeonholing of vendors and solutions around client engagement areas helps to define innovations, especially when artificial intelligence tools can be refined to help understand client behaviours, outcomes and life events.</p><p>A much more open approach to innovation, bringing in outside vendors rather than constructing everything within the bank is helping to enhance these changes, as talk is finally being turned into action.</p><p>\"I think the big banks really struggled with the 'build it, buy it' approach,\" said April Rudin, CEO of the Rudin Group. \"I think for this year, what we have really seen is a huge emphasis on partnerships, which is what really works for these institutions,\" be they banks or tech providers or even the 'big tech' giants as Facebook and Google, who are increasingly making a push into financial services.</p><p>FOLLOWING THE NORTH STAR None of this can be achieved without leadership and changes in organisational culture. It is not the digital work that is hardest, but the organisational transformation and change that goes with it, often coming from the very summit of the bank, confirmed JP Morgan's Ms Keough. \"I know that I have the support of our CEO and chairman in what we are doing,\" she said.</p><p>\"And he has provided the North Star when times get tough, or different groups are worried about digital in their estates. He has helped us stay on track, on course, and given us the wherewithal to push through and get us to the right place together.\"</p><p>Inspirational leaders in private banking have included Piyush Gupta, CEO of Singapore's regional Asian bank DBS, which our panellists agreed has been in the vanguard of digitalisation.</p><p>\"DBS was in a very difficult place after 2009,\" said independent consultant Mario Bassi. \"It was hit very badly after the GFC and they had to let go about 500 people, which has never been seen before in Singapore. So there was a lot of uncertainty, a lot of questions.\"</p><p>OUTSIDE INFLUENCES But Mr Gupta began bringing in strong leaders underneath him to develop digital products, and not only spending time with groups of employees but looking at other industries closely for inspiration.</p><p>Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, is one area which will likely help transform wealth management, though not all banks are yet convinced of this power, especially once we get to satellite rather than core portfolio assets.</p><p>\"Now if you all think about your businesses and you start tokenising two thirds of non-bankable alternative asses, think how your revenue base will explode,\" said Urs Bolt, independent adviser at Zurich-based Bolt Now. \"It will totally change the way you actually characterise assets.\"</p><p>Firms owned by clients can also play a huge role in influencing the digital direction taken by private banks. \"You have very good impacts from our clients, because they enter a different type of interaction in relation with the bank,\" said Ms Rassai at BNP Paribas.</p><p>\"Many of them are entrepreneurs themselves, so they appreciate being part of this initiative and discovering the financial culture.\"</p><p>Retail and luxury brand companies that combine both bricks and mortar with online solutions should also provide inspiration for private banking business models of the future.</p><p>\"Those who create divides between them have struggled much more,\" admitted JP Morgan's Ms Keough.</p><p>\"We can learn from that experience as we build our relationship between our digital and our bricks and mortar.\"</p><p>Banks have justifiable excuses for why things have not moved so quickly in the past 10 years STEPHEN WALL THE WEALTH MOSAIC</p><p>This year, what we have really seen is a huge emphasis on partnerships, which is what really works for these institutions APRIL RUDIN THE RUDIN GROUP</p><p>Those who create divides between their physical and online solutions have struggled much more KELLI KEOUGH JP MORGAN CHASE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A number of the panelists were judges for PWM's Wealth Tech awards, including, from left, Stephen Wall, April Rudin, Urs Bolt, Sharmil Patwa and Mario BassiPWM's second annual Wealth Tech Awards were held at the new FT headquarters in June and opened with drinks on the roof terrace.

Our aim was to discuss the current state of the private banking technology market and to plot a future road map for the industry's digitalisation journey.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RISING TO THE CHALLENGE It very quickly became clear from our panel participants that much digitalisation is driven by costs and business model optimisation - basically saving money and staff resources while improving profits - rather than the so-called \"client experience\" or \"customer journey\", which many private banks pride themselves on. \"The influence of the client experience has not been as radical as I had expected,\" confirms wealth adviser and former Zurich private banker Urs Bolt. \"It has mostly been driven by costs and shareholder value.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This cost-driven digitalisation strategy is one key reason why few chief executives are proud of their efforts in this sphere. Many of these efforts are piecemeal and disjointed, with genuine innovation much scarcer than expected.</p><p>\"We see some very interesting initiatives, but they are often on-offs,\" says Alois Pirker, research director for wealth management at the Aite Group in Boston.</p><p>\"I think it's a tricky thing to take your organisation with you on the ride, because KPIs [key performance indicators] are very often structured around maximising your current business and being very silo-driven.\"</p><p>The outcome many private bank bosses would like to see in an ideal world, he says, is an atmosphere of firm-wide innovation, that pushes both the bank's customer relations and its business model to the next level, rather than just pure technology implementation, but the restrictive nature of most financial services organisations makes this incredibly difficult to achieve.</p><p>Incremental changes which most banks introduce will not really make much of a dent into digital transformation requirements, believes Victor Allende, head of private banking at Caixa in Barcelona, one of Spain's fastest innovators and consolidators in the country's banking sector.</p><p>\"You don't just change your bank because you have a huge digital programme,\" says Mr Allende. \"You change your bank because you introduce the changes into your DNA and your culture and that is something you have to do in the long term; it is not something you can do from one day to another.\"</p><p>Yet there were also dissenting voices about cost-cutting being the key influence towards digitalisation. There are banks, believes Mohammad Kamal Syed of Coutts, that fundamentally focus on clients rather than costs when introducing digital transformation programmes.</p><p>The key to this process, adds April Rudin, founder of The Rudin , r , , , r s c , t, , , , , .</p><p>i , t --f Group, a New York-based wealth consultancy, is to avoid a \"one size fits all model\" and to be able to deliver services to clients, regardless of their generation or world view.</p><p>THE BANK OF THE FUTURE Our panelists agreed that many private banks and wealth managers must find a new USP now the traditional tax and secrecy advantages previously enjoyed by many offshore centres, and the banks that congregated in them, have largely evaporated. Knowledge, expertise and intelligence are becoming much more sought after as differentiators in the new reality, says Mr Bolt.</p><p>This does not mean, however, that only the newcomers, the techled institutions, can survive in this battleground. Far from it, believes Mr Allende of Caixa. Leveraging a deep, traditional heritage can still be beneficial in contemporary times and is respected by clients in the relationship with their banker.</p><p>\"How we digitise that experience, how we bring that whole heritage to life is incredibly important,\" he says.</p><p>Transforming wealth firms means integrating staff, rather than allowing them to be divided into competing teams, believes Ms Rudin. \"You walk into a meeting and on one side of the table you have the 'hoodies', the guys with no ties, and on the other you see the bankers. So the real challenge is to take all these influences and combine them into one brand.\"</p><p>The next challenge is modernising this brand and keeping it relevant to the ongoing experience of clients. Much of this will be down to more progressive recruitment.</p><p>\"It depends on your ability to bring on talent that's not just financial service-oriented, but recruiting people who come from some of the big tech companies and have had successful digitalisation programmes,\" suggests Ms Rudin.</p><p>Banks must also look at other industries, such as the luxury goods sector, she says, and infuse these diverse experiences into a single bank brand, which can bring together a variety of influences.</p><p>Private banks are also struggling with the pace and velocity of change, believes Aite's Mr Pirker.</p><p>\"It's not that they don't want to do it,\" he explains. \"I think everyone wants to say they are agile and they are digitalising all of this, but when you have very big scale institutions which are highly regulated, you have certain issues which mean you cannot move as fast some of the smaller players.\"</p><p>THE CUSTOMER JOURNEY Analysing customer relationships in private banking can be much more complex than a black and white distinction between face-to-face and digital-first clients, believes Mr Allende at Caixa Bank. Most banks, he says, are still at a very early stage in the learning process when it comes to deciphering how the banks' initiatives, behaviours and products affect their customers' preferences and loyalty, especially in the digital age.</p><p>The opportunity is tremendous, believe our panellists, to inform clients about a bank's expertise, although care must be taken so this does not appear as another productpush exercise, the like of which has traditionally alienated many clients.</p><p>Digital channels in particular can be used to amplify strategies and opportunities in investment management, says Coutts' Mr Syed. The bank has long faced the challenge of how to communicate information around its highly progressive and well-resourced investment operation to a traditional clientele more interested in pure banking and borrowing.</p><p>\"How can we bring to life some of the thinking that goes behind our portfolio?\" asks Mr Syed. He has a feeling that while digitalisation marks a huge challenge for Coutts, it provides an opportunity for this type of communication and will work much more efficiently than a banker having to pick up the phone and try to convince each wealthy client that some strategic investments of their assets may be in their long-term interests.</p><p>Many assumptions which banks make about which groups prefer a particular communication channel often need to be re-thought during the digitalisation process, he says.</p><p>\"We had certain assumptions about who uses our call centre most, but it was actually the younger generation that was using it more than we expected and definitely much more than the slightly older generation,\" says Mr Syed. \"This concept of millennials being completely digital was turned on its head.\"</p><p>The notion of banks escaping from commoditisation and using digital channels to expand their services was again stressed by Ms Rudin.</p><p>\"Digital allows people to come up with different products and services to differentiate themselves,\" she says. \"That's something we have not seen in a long time.\"</p><p>EXTERNAL PARTNERS Working with a greater range of external partners gives a huge opportunity for private banks to move away from standardised service solutions for their clients, agree our roundtable participants.</p><p>\"I think when it comes to front office processes, you want to be unique and build for your clients something that may be different from the next firm,\" says Aite's Mr Pirker.</p><p>But liasing with more external firms should not muddy the waters, rather it allows banks to choose the most appropriate technological solutions.</p><p>\"It doesn't mean having everybody's standard solution. It just means you can have smart partners that can get you where you need to be,\" says Mr Pirker.</p><p>\"What we are also seeing is a separation of front office innovation that is much more agile, and back office that is much more stable.\"</p><p>The notion of banks combining their platforms to achieve scale also finds favour in wealth management circles. \"Automation can enable client facing processes to be extremely smooth,\" says Mr Bolt, advocating the combining of forces to bring this to bear.</p><p>Financial technology companies will have a strong role to play in the process of digitalisation, believes Mr Syed at Coutts.</p><p>\"We work with financial technology companies all the time across our entire propositions. Some will dovetail into our investment management functions, some into our banking functions and some into our balance sheet,\" he says. \"But each one will bring something new, so we are always looking for the best partners in the market.\"</p><p>Much digitalisation is driven by costs and business model optimisation rather than the so-called 'client experience' or 'customer journey' which many private banks pride themselves on</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The panelists, which included Mohammad Kamal Syed (bottom left) and April Rudin (bottom right), agreed that both traditional institutions and new start-ups have a role to play in the digital transformation of the wealth mangement industryPWM's innaugural Wealth Tech Awards were held at the FT headquarters on 14 June.

To improve performance and increase returns, firms have: honed their specialties in hot sectors such as healthcare and SaaS; gone down market into the middle market and searched out geographies that may offer more upside than domestic deals; they're also working to increase transparency with their LPs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Looking back, of the 33 deals that tipped the scales above $10 billion in 2019, private equity firms led only six. These large deals may have stoked dollar volume in sponsor-led M&amp;A, but the real action took place in smaller deals at undisclosed prices.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Through Dec. 12, The Deal's M&amp;A database tracked 3,548 transactions including add-ons, investments, consortium deals, leveraged buyouts, management buyouts and private acquisitions. That's up from about 3,260 deals under the same search parameters for all of 2018.</p><p>To some extent, GPs are simply delivering what their investors want.\u00a0</p><p>U.S. buyouts of $500 million to $2.5 billion, U.S. small-market buyouts of less than $500 million and U.S. growth capital funds, stand as as the three most desirable sectors out of 23 fund types, according to the Probitas Partners Private Equity Investors Trends 2020 survey results.\u00a0</p><p>While GPs talked about a potential recession, LPs registered a decline in interest in special situations and distressed debt funds this year, according to the Probitas survey.</p><p>Greenfield Geographies Down Market</p><p>As more attention focuses on the middle market, dealmakers look to new geographies or for smaller deals that may not attract as much competition as larger, more high-profile exits to deploy capital.</p><p>Anacapa Partners LLC's Jeff Stevens, a managing partner, and Ashley Geisler, a managing director said they expect a comparable number of acquisitions in 2020. The firm announced six purchases in 2019 and seven in 2018.\u00a0</p><p>The growth capital firm seeks out healthy companies in need of a leadership transition, then provides the company with a senior executive to take charge from a cultivated pool of candidates. It looks to partner with healthy companies with $1.5 million to $5 million of Ebitda. Its average entry multiple is about 5.8 times Ebitda and it typically exits its companies at a price of more than 10 times Ebitda, with an average hold period of about five years.\u00a0</p><p>\"Our investment model is focused on working with business owners below the middle market that are looking to make a management transition,\" Stevens said. \"This focus allows us to spend the vast majority of our time working on transactions that are more focused on solving for personal needs/desires and less driven by trying to time the market.  The result is more consistent investment activity. [That's]\u00a0 the reason that we expect 2020 to have similar levels of activity to the previous two years.\"</p><p>The firm just announced three growth equity investment deals in Latin America including <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/deals/maa/413112/view.dl|communications\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/deals/maa/413112/view.dl|communications</url> platform-as-a-service, company Auronix SA de CV, in Mexico; Agasus SA,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewCompany.dl?id=2488137|a\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewCompany.dl?id=2488137|a</url> hardware-as-a-service (HaaS) provider in Brazil and a growth investment in I4PRO Inform\u00c3\u00a1tica Ltda.

This continues a trend that stretches back several years as returns dwindled in the more other asset classes such as stocks and public debt.\u00a0</p><p>He expects a strong capital raising environment for GPs in 2020.\u00a0</p><p> In terms of fundraising what I m hearing from the large GPs, there s still a lot of demand, but you have to customize your offerings for larger investors,\" McChesney said. \"It s getting more complicated. You have big funds with 120 legal entities because every investor is solving to be more tax efficient. </p><p>Pressure to increase the efficiency of private markets will drive investments in technology as well as some M&amp;A in the fintech space.</p><p>One example is BlackRock Inc. s (BLK) <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/deals/maa/406318/view.dl|acquisition\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/deals/maa/406318/view.dl|acquisition</url> of\u00a0French software company EFrontSAS for $1.3 billion in March, 2019.</p><p>\"There s a real need to build infrastructure that will make this part of the capital market more efficient, and give investors more control and transparency,  McChesney said.  There s a wave of substantial tech investment that s starting to\u00a0 happen.\"</p><p>For 2020, it s possible that some private company valuations may continue to ease back. Even if the economy cools, however, allocations into alternatives won t slow down significantly.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p> Private company valuations may come back to reality   there will be a little less fairy dust in 2020,  McChesney said.  Some of those blips and adjustments may affect valuations, but the big picture is clearer in terms of more participation in private markets.\"</p><p>In the global fund space, Brown Brothers Harriman sees a sustained increase in demand for private equity, private credit and real assets. The largest asset managers in Asia are investing in private equity for the first time. Insurance companies are only at 1% or 2% allocations. Allocations still have further to go here in terms of demand, he said. These trends are bigger than the economic cycle and are reshaping the capital formation process, McChesney said.</p><p>Silicon Beach Emerges</p><p>A.J. Weidhaas, partner, and co-chair of private equity at Goodwin Procter LLP, said his firm has seen strong growth in M&amp;A activity in sponsored 2019. In its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the law firm s deal volume increased by over 15% and it expects comparable growth for the calendar year.\u00a0</p><p>Among hot sectors, health and wellness deals within the health sector remain plentiful among PE deals.\u00a0</p><p> Anything that touches on healthy living within the consumer space&amp; any company that focuses on making sure you don t have to go to the doctor   we re seeing activity in that space,  Weidhaas said. \"Within technology, private equity firms continue playing a larger role in the sector as the industry matures and tech is woven into manufacturing, distribution and other areas, he said.</p><p>As it looks toward the 2020, the firm eyes more private market M&amp;A activity in Southern California's tech scene as the firm s Silicon Beach office in Santa Monica, Calif., marks its first full year in operation.\u00a0</p><p>The firm continues to hire lawyers for the office, which is geared toward private equity and the lively tech-sector activity in the area as entrepreneurs from the Bay Area flee to a more early-stage-friendly market with plentiful resources. In 2019, Weidhaas worked on a few Silicon Beach deals including\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/deals/maa/405854/view.dl|the\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/deals/maa/405854/view.dl|the</url> sale of\u00a0L.A.-based Chrome River Technologies Inc., a Great Hill Partners LP portfolio company.</p><p>\"Silicon Beach looks a lot like Silicon Valley did in the late 1990s building up to the first tech bubble,  Weidhaas said.  Now Silicon Valley is dominated by the giants in tech and there s a fight for resources such as office space, housing and talent&amp;.Entrepreneurs from companies in Silicon Valley exit one company and move out to start their next venture to places like Silicon Beach, which has a different profile that s less dominated by Big Tech. </p><p>2020 Election Causes Some Uncertainty</p><p>Overall, 2020 continues to look strong for private equity, Goodwin Procter's Weidhaas said, though things could change with results of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>\"The pipeline at this point is not showing any sign of slowing down,\" Weidhaas said. \"We ve got a couple of significant data points coming up as we get into the 2020 election. Those could obviously cut a number of different ways.\"</p><p>The impeachment proceedings on Capitol Hill have already been baked into financial markets, but some uncertainty remains over whether a more left-leaning Democrat such as Elizabeth Warren will win the Democratic nomination. Warren s stated approach to increase regulatory oversight over Wall Street could cause dealmakers to accelerate M&amp;A transactions prior to the election if she were to emerge as the nominee, he said.\u00a0</p><p> We may see an acceleration of activity in the summer in an otherwise slow cycle if this happens,  Weidhaas said. As for whether the long economic expansion that began in 2010 continues, Weidhaas remains cautious but optimistic like other dealmakers.\u00a0</p><p> There s little doubt in my mind that we re at the tail end of the cycle,  Weidhaas said.  The question is whether that means we re going to have a significant pullback or hopefully, a more gradual downturn. </p><h>DEAL SIZE</h><p>Undisclosed</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-20002994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTB-JY31-JBSN-101N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1586\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Deal, L.L.C.

Accounting firm Ernst ...ung released a paper[1] funded by the American Investment Council, the industry's chief trade group, with a host of half-truths and misleading statistics, including estimating the annual salary of workers at private equity-owned firms at $71,000 a year by including the executives and the private equity portfolio managers in the equation. Blackstone's Steven Schwarzman took home $786 million[2] in 2018; once you average him in with a bunch of part-time Toys 'R' Us workers, the numbers start to look pretty good.Then, the American Investment Council's CEO touted the Popeye's chicken sandwich[3]\u2014that great invention available only to companies owned by financial managers\u2014as an example of private equity's value to the economy. Companies used to praise themselves for saving lives and connecting the world, now it's for adding a pickle and mayo to fried poultry. </p><p>By the way, the same private equity group that owns Popeye's, Brazilian firm 3G Capital, was last seen taking two iconic brands in Kraft and Heinz, merging them, running the company completely into the ground, and walking away[4].Speaking of walking away, private equity just closed a chapter on the opportunity it sought out of the misery of the financial crisis. As millions of families suffered the sting of foreclosure, private equity firms fanned out to distressed areas across the country and scooped up foreclosed properties[5], spending about $100 million a week. They quickly turned over the properties and rented them out, behaving exactly the way you'd expect a Wall Street landlord to: offering substandard and often dangerous rentals with mold and busted pipes, dragging their feet at making repairs, jacking up rents at will, layering on hidden charges, evicting aggressively.After inventing the industry, firms sought to cash out, consolidating the Wall Street rental market into a few firms. Blackstone, the largest private equity firm, was the last, merging Invitation Homes with Starwood Waypoint for an empire of 82,000 homes. On Wednesday, they sold the last of the stock[6], bringing their haul to $7 billion since the 2017 Invitation Homes IPO. That's more than double the initial investment. So Blackstone disrupted rental markets, delivered poor-quality homes to many of the same people who lost theirs in the first place, contributed to the global affordable-housing crisis, according to a U.N. special rapporteur[7], and made off with billions in the process.No wonder those defenses ring hollow.

STORY UPDATE WPRI in Rhode Island talked to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse[20] about our story about a bill he co-authored that would encourage deep cuts in mandatory spending. Whitehouse said that he would not support any cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, which is fine, but it's up to the Senate, not just him, after he puts this process in place. 'Our reform bill simply requires the Senate to periodically consider legislation to cut the deficit,' Whitehouse says, and that's the point. Sometimes Republicans will be in charge of government under that requirement, so what Whitehouse personally supports is immaterial. He's creating a monster that will not be under his control.

As Democrats are forced to pick sides in these fights, however, one other extremely consequential dividing line may be left out of the conversation: the one between candidates fighting to stop private equity and candidates taking the industry's money. A handful of presidential hopefuls are leaving no doubts about where they stand. Earlier this month, Elizabeth Warren, joined by co-sponsors Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand, introduced acomprehensive bill[1]that would bring private equity to its knees. </p><p>The week prior, Sanders joined arally[2]protesting a private-equity firm's decision to close Philadelphia's Hahnemann University Hospital. Even without legislation, the next president will have many tools to combat the private-equity threat. We have not heard a peep from the other candidates; some appeared in public comments tonot know what private equity is[3]. Taken alone, this silence is puzzling. Combine it with the fact that many of those silent presidential hopefuls are raking in cash from private equity's biggest actors, however, and it starts to look a lot more worrisome.Private-equity bigwigs' support for candidates like Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris raises worries that these presidential hopefuls would not make use of the tools at their disposal should they accede to the Oval Office. Worse yet, it suggests that private equity might have a place within their administration. Private equity has savvily avoided being listed in the same breath as other corporate bogeymen. Nonetheless, the industry represents an enormous, multipronged, and rapidly growing threat to everyday Americans. Private-equity firms buy companies with borrowed money and extract value from them to enrich themselves and their investors, whether the company survives or not. Earlier this month, one private-equity firm drew particularly acute outrage when it announced it was closing Philadelphia'sHahnemann University Hospital[4]in order to extract value from its well-located real estate. That, however, is just the tip of the iceberg. When private-equity firms are not closing hospitals, they are acting as adriving force[5]behind surprise medical billing. Or they might be putting you out of a job. According to anew report[6]from the Center for Popular Democracy and the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, PE is responsible for destroying over 600,000 retail jobs in the last ten years, triggering bankruptcies for iconic brands likeToys 'R' Us[7]andSears[8]. Private equity could also be yourlandlord[9], having bought up 200,000 single-family homes during the foreclosure crisis. Unsurprisingly, these firms have made forterrible landlords[10], failing to perform basic maintenance, aggressively increasing rents annually to deliver returns for their investors, and evicting frequently.Private equity might also bedriving up[11]your college tuition costs and lowering the quality of your education. Anew study[12]found that for-profit colleges acquired by private-equity firms see falling graduation rates, earnings, and loan repayment rates. That means more students saddled with debt they cannot repay. Given its villainous profile, it should hardly come as a surprise that the industry is alsoincredibly[13]close[14]to Trump.While private equity's exploits began long before Trump became president, the industry has found a close and lucrative ally in this administration. Numerous formerprivate-equity titans[15]have been tapped to fill powerful roles throughout the executive branch, including Wilbur Ross as Secretary of Commerce and Kenneth Juster on the National Economic Council. Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of Blackstone, the world's largest private-equity firm, is amassive Trump donor[16]and was accordingly appointedchairman[17]of the president's Strategic and Policy Forum. Schwarzman was among those whotagged along[18]for Trump'sfirst overseas trip[19]to Saudi Arabia, and it was while standing in theroyal palace in Riyadh[20]that Blackstone announced it had been picked to manage the country's new$20 billion fund[21]for chiefly American infrastructure investments. These relationships are paying off domestically as well as overseas by way oflooser regulations[22]that make it even easier for private equity to reap enormous profits off the backs of others. Happily, the future president will have broad powers to reverse the Trump administration's actions and to rein in this exploitative industry. That effort would likely start with appointingfinancial regulators[23]who would impose more stringent rules on leveraged lending, a key piece of what makes the private equity model profitable. Executive branch appointees could also target private-equity firms by homing in on the sectors in which they operate. For example, appointees within the Department of Education could require for-profit colleges to demonstrate that the education they provide is of some value, a standard that wouldclose up[24]many private equity-run shops. Motivated and creative appointees throughout the executive branch would undoubtedly find still other ways to limit private equity's predatory exploits. Although a handful of candidates, like Sanders and Warren, seemready[25]for the confrontation, other candidates have been much quieter about the threat posed by private equity. In the meantime, they have been happily accepting the industry's cash. In the second quarter, Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris have all received donations from one or both of the leaders of the country's top two private-equity firms, Blackstone and the Carlyle Group. Buttigieg received max donations from 11 high-level Blackstone employees, as well as money from Bain Capital and Neuberger Berman. Biden, Booker, and Gillibrand nabbed donations from employees at at least three of the top 15 private-equity firms. Admittedly, even 11 max donations seems like chump change when top candidates' total fundraising hauls are anywhere from $12 million to $25 million. Many of these donors, however, are not just writing checks, but also collecting them from others on the candidates' behalf. The figures they raise are often consequential. For example,Tony James[26], executive vice chairman at Blackstone, bundled over $100,000 for Hillary Clinton in 2016. This time around, hehosted a fundraiser[27]for Buttigieg in June. Another $100k-plus Clinton bundler (more precise information on Clinton bundlers issadly unavailable[28]), Carlyle Group managing directorJames Attwood[29], gave to Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, Gillibrand, and Harris this quarter. It is possible but unlikely that candidates won the industry's support by offering explicit assurances that they will not undermine the private equity business model. It need not amount to such a clear quid pro quo, however, to be concerning. Candidates' silence on what ought to be a primary target for Democrats is worrisome enough. That is because private equity can get its way through executive branch personnel, an area in which candidates have been asked to make very few public promises, and thus where they face next to no accountability. Private equity could continue to thrive without any changes to the status quo; all they need is confidence that a candidate will not appoint financial regulators intent on rocking the boat. In 2016, for example, Tony James's namesurfaced[30]frequently as a potentialTreasury secretary[31]. Maybe he's hoping for another shot at the seat? Luckily for these candidates, they can address our worries through a couple of simple actions. First, each must end their silence on private equity. Senator Gillibrand, to her credit, has done so by co-sponsoring Warren's bill. Second, just as candidates are expected to address how they will combat the threats posed by Big Tech,Big Pharma[32], and others, they must do so for private equity. That must include being clear about the types of people they plan to appoint to their executive branch and being explicit that private-equity executives will not be among them. If candidates neglect to take these essential steps, however, we will be forced to expect the worst of their future administrations.

Now these two juggernauts of information are going head-to-head in classic trust-busting fashion.The Wall Street Journal[1]reported over the weekend that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched two investigations into Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG[2]) \u2014 aka Google \u2014 for antitrust violations. Separately,The Washington Post[3]said that the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had divided up territory between Google and Amazon.com Inc.</p><p>(Nasdaq: AMZN[4]) \u2014 in much the same way you and your uncle discuss who will get the drumstick at Thanksgiving dinner. The implication is clear: the U.S. government is gunning for Big Tech. And it's through playing around. Tech juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Facebook (Nasdaq: FB[5]) (which was surprisingly left off the government's weekend hit list) need to be reined in and given some guidelines. But the secrecy of these government investigations should raise a few more1984-ish hackles. Candidates like Bernie Sanders, D-V.T., and Elizabeth Warren, D-M.A., and even President Trump have called for crackdowns on Big Tech companies. However, the official line from the DOJ and the FTC has been to sit by and wait and allow tech behemoths to become even bigger. They are even considering approving the Sprint/T-Mobile merger. But whatever they were waiting for, they've apparently found it in Amazon and Google. If the DOJ and FTC are getting serious, we could be looking at a battle of the ages: aBrave New Worldv.1984-style battle. The Takeaway: One thing is obvious: If the DOJ and FTC decide to act, it's going to be bad for all FAANG stocks such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and others. While these companies offer extraordinary value for investors, portfolios betting on FAANG stocks are going to see a bumpy ride. What may not be obvious in this Huxley v. Orwell battle is the value of investing in cybersecurity companies. Firms such as Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE: PANW[6]) and Fortinet Inc. (Nasdaq: FTNT[7]). These companies' products not only help keep you safe from unruly hackers, but they can also help protect your data from FAANG and government intrusion. And that's a big plus no matter what happens between the DOJ and Big Tech companies.It was only a matter of time before the big guns in mobile tech came knocking at Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (NYSE: AMD[8]) door. The company has the best ultra low power chips on the market, and now Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. is looking to get a taste. The duo announced amultiyear partnership[9]this morning to roll out mobile graphics in Samsung mobile devices based on AMD Radeon graphics chips. 'We look forward to working with AMD to accelerate innovations in mobile graphics technologies that will help take future mobile computing to the next level,' said Samsung in a statement. This is excellent news for AMD, and yet another reason for investors to jump on the bullish semiconductor bandwagon [Note: link to PRL 'tech boom' promo]. The Bad: Just How Far Down Do You Want to Go?President Trump has the pistols, so he'll get the pesos but Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE: CMG[10])doesn't think that's fair[11]. They'd like to talk it out over a cup of joe. This morning, the burrito baron said that Trump's proposed Mexican tariffs 'could increase costs by $15 million and reduce margins by 20 to 30 basis points.' In a statement, chief financial officer Jack Hartung indicated that prices would rise if the tariffs were made permanent. He said: 'We could also consider passing on these costs through a modest price increase, such as about a nickel on a burrito, which would cover the increased cost without impacting our strong value proposition.' But Chipotle isn't the only one staring down the tariff barrel. Smaller chains like Chuy's Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: CHUY[12]) could be hurt even more by rising costs. According to analysts at research firm Morningstar, these smaller chains would have trouble hedging against tariffs. Investors might want to put their salsa lessons on hold for now. There's no indication as to how long these tariffs will last. The Ugly: FedEx Hits a Great WallWe've all been there. You're waiting on a package that's supposed to be delivered today. So, you constantly update the FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX[13]) website to see where that package is, only to see it has somehow ended up in Timbuktu or Newark (same difference, really). You're mad. You want your package now! What do you do? Well, if you're China, you launch an investigation into wrongful delivery, escalate an international trade war and send FDX stock down sharply on the news. In this case, FedEx accidentally sent crucial Huawei documents to the U.S., instead of to Huawei headquarters. Given the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei, China feels things aren't quite kosher in this situation, and they're taking it out on FedEx. What's more, China is also considering adding FedEx to a list of 'unreliable entities' that could harm Chinese business interests. While the impact to FedEx shouldn't be all that big, the other names that could find their way on to the 'unreliable' list include Qualcomm Inc. (Nasdaq: QCOM[14]), Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC[15]) and Alphabet. Qualcomm is already dealing with a monopoly ruling in the U.S., Alphabet could battle the DOJ soon and Intel is losing market share to AMD. This is quickly growing into a list of 'who not to invest in' right now.[16][17]<url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/T-b-bbrrJIM\">https://youtu.be/T-b-bbrrJIM</url>[18][19]      \u00a0    <url

However, they said the risk of depriving the food production system of organic resources must be weighed up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bio-based private sector contributes 4.2% to Europe's GDP. It generates (EURO)621 billion added value and around (EURO)2 trillion in annual turnover. It also employed 18 million people in 2015, of which more than two-thirds were in agriculture and food manufacturing sectors.</p><p>However, the labour productivity gains of agriculture, forestry and fishing remained at (EURO)20,000 per person employed in the 2008-2015 period, below the industry average in other sectors of (EURO)34,000 per person employed.</p><p>Launched in 2013, the EU Commission's bioeconomy strategy was initially conceived as a way to encourage the foundation of post-petroleum energy independent Europe. But it soon moved towards solving more cycle problems, including in agriculture and food security.</p><p>When it comes to sustainability, people, but governments as well, mainly look at energy, cars, buildings, according to Gerda Verburg, United Nations Secretary-General assistant and coordinator of the UN Scaling up Nutrition (SUN) movement.</p><p>\"They should pay more attention to agriculture, forestry and fisheries because, in the end, these sectors should keep our planet in healthy conditions to feed the world population,\" she said.</p><p>For Verburg, although it is still work in progress, the bioeconomy concept is an opportunity to \"close the circle\", especially in the breeding sector where it is possible to fix the problem of greenhouse emissions that animals produce.</p><h/><p>The European Commission's new strategy is seeking to create a sustainable bioeconomy and build a carbon-neutral future. Rather than just find a replacement for petroleum-based products, the strategy addresses broader cyclic challenges, including food and nutrition security.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Private sector involvement</emphasis></p><p>Verburg also said big tech companies and the private sector should be involved in all the possible solutions to assist farmers.</p><p>Bioeconomy provides a source of additional income from farmers, foresters and fishermen, but it could also be a profitable business for private companies that bring to market services and products.</p><p>\"I don't care if companies are making profits out of the transfer from a non-sustainable production toward sustainable production,\" she said, adding that she is much more concerned about companies that continue to push farmers to buy their products.</p><p>According to her, it is the fact that some companies are maximising their profits at the cost of people and environment that should raise concerns, rather than the fact that they make use of an innovative approach to support farmers and at the same time develop biodiversity.</p><p>\"Good for them if they make money out of this, as long as they are part of the solution. And let's be frank, a company who doesn't make profits, also won't make a leap into future,\" she said.</p><p>The private sector is the main actor in all the new agricultural trends, according to Davit Kirvalidze, Georgia's candidate for FAO Directory general and former agriculture minister of his country. Asked by EURACTIV particularly about bioeconomy, he replied, \"Empower the private sector, and the private sector will know how to do it\".</p><p>He added that the private sector had always led the progress while the role of governments is to provide companies with the right regulatory and institutional environment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Risks</emphasis></p><p>Per Pinstrup-Andersen, a Danish economist and Professor Emeritus at Cornell University, stressed that we \"do need to understand much better how to approach all the biological resources used in the bioeconomy framework\".</p><p>According to him, many risks could come from the use of natural resources for purposes other than food, as has happened with biofuels, which he considers as the wrong way to cope with the energy security problem.</p><p>He added that some co-products like animal manure should be kept in the food circle to produce organic fertilisers, rather than be used for energy production.</p><p>Animal manure could be treated, indeed, through a process of anaerobic digestion to produce biogas, a renewable fuel which contains methane and that can have an impact in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>\"We have to be very careful that we know what we're doing so that we don't simply subtract natural resources from food production with some very negative consequences,\" Pinstrup-Andersen concluded.</p><p>The European Commission put the use of biofertilisers as one of the areas to develop in the context of the new bioeconomy strategy, unveiled last October.</p><p>\"I would really like to see manure used as a feedstock for fertilisers. It is part of the circular economy philosophy,\" Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said during the presentation of the strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1334657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYH-XSJ1-DYXB-V14S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Biodiversity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>bioeconomy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>common agricultural policy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00095A2</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLLL</classCode><className>FOOD SALES &amp;

We got Andrew Sheets on  earlier, a little bit more of an equity angle, here with bonds, Priya Misra  is with TD Securities and the head of all of their rates strategy, as well.</p><p> Are we in a normal rate environment?  The answer is, this has changed, this  has changed, this has changed, but your world is still not normal, is it?</p><p> PRIYA MISRA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RATES STRATEGY, TD SECURITIES:  I think if you  try and decompose interest rates into set of central bank expectations and  term premium, we're in a new normal over that term premium is concerned.   There's a lot of money chasing yield.  And so, you know, treasuries at 2.30  are actually pretty cheap if you compare with bunds or -- or you compare  with JGB, so I think that's sort of the new normal we're in.  When it's  very hard, I think, for bond yields to rise even with central banks  normalizing, if you got this very large balance sheet and global rates  staying low.  So I think that's the new normal here.</p><p> KEENE:  OK.  Well, Francine just brought this up, let's pull economics into  Priya Misra's world.  Bring this up in the wall.  This -- we can't send  this out the way the (inaudible) are set up.  This is the Taylor rule that  Francine was showing earlier.  And here's the soup (ph) down here.  These  are the equations that Priya memorized in Bangalore when she took her  masters.  Here is Nehru right here.  Now, that's a Ned Phelps kind of  economic number there.  What is your belief on the system and the idea that  rates could nudge up as Bill Gross talks about when you look at the  demographic realities of something like Nehru?</p><p> MISRA:  I think Nehru is at the (inaudible) in observable quantity.  We all  tried to estimate it.  The Fed, I think, has struggled.  The (inaudible) of  Nehru significantly.</p><p> KEENE:  Does it signal lower interest rates sustained, or is Bill Gross  right, the great moderation is ebbing away and we may go with higher rates?</p><p> MISRA:  I'm not entirely convinced that -- that it's -- it's sort of ebbing  away.  And the -- I guess the main reason is that if -- if you look at  structural forces, productivity is very low, wage inflation, despite the  fact, you were just talking about juries, the labor market is on fire, we  still haven't had any wage inflation, really.  So, you know, you're not  seeing wage inflation, you're seeing PCE actually head lower, we're  estimating we'll continuing to head lower over the next six months.  So  whatever your estimate of Nehru is, you know, it's probably lower than what  we've all thought.  And that should mean that the neutral rate for The Fed  or where the hiking cycle ends is actually much lower than historical.</p><p> So we may see a little bit of ebbing away, I think interest rates can  certainly rise, 25-30 basis points, we're not talking a hundred basis  points.</p><p> FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG NEWS:  Right.  But, Priya, once the Fed hikes,  is this now, you know, a stronger sustained trend?  And are they right to  focus on stability?  You can argue that actually a lot of the indicators  point to stability and they are preferring that to actually looking at that  inflation given what you just said about PCE?</p><p> MISRA:  Right.  That's a fair point.  I think we start to struggle with  whether that's the reason why the Fed wants to normalize here.  There is no  reason for the inflation point for them to continue to hike.  I think that  it's -- it's partly there, but the Fed, I think, at least, under the  current leadership does want to focus on sort of macro prudential reasons  or -- or -- or tools to actually control financial stability and use  monetary policy specifically for the economy, but I think your question  becomes very valid once we're at a zero real rate.  So once the Fed has  normalized, now they've certainly started normalizing the balance sheet,  once they think we're at some normal interest rate, not neutral, but  normal, I think then the question becomes, what's the catalyst to continue  to tighten, you know, maybe financial conditions will -- will become  important then.  I think that's where Fed leadership becomes significantly  important, which we know is -- is entirely influx here.</p><p> LACQUA:  So what would be the catalyst to tighten, Priya?  And is -- and do  -- you know, should they worry about distortion, for example, in the  markets?</p><p> MISRA:  You know, I think to an extent, they are still normalizing.  I  still think that they should use macro prudential tools, now, you know, the  tool -- the -- the Fed does have the regulatory site.  If they ease that  significantly, and certainly with -- with Randy Quarles, with, you know --  if we you see significant easing off of financial regulation, I think then  the Fed absolutely should take that into account.</p><p> KEENE:  Priya Misra with us, and we'll continue this discussion linking in  fixed income into the (inaudible), particularly for the markets, and we saw  that 22,800 on the Dow yesterday.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> KEENE:  Watching on our set, Priya Misra of TD Securities, and within full  faith in credit and sovereign debt within the United States, this goes to  the opportunity to buy more beleaguered with the stress yield.  But I keep  hearing this phrase in your literature and others of record tight where the  -- the -- the U.S. yield is here or the U.K. yield is here, and things like  Catalonia, the yield comes in.  Is that still where we are?</p><p> MISRA:  I think we are.  But when it comes to political risk, I think  that's very difficult to price.  So I'm not sure you're supposed to be  buying Spanish bonds just yet.  I mean, the market has corrected  significantly, we're not at any wide levels for Spain.  I mean, if 1.55 is  triggered, I think you get a lot more political risk getting priced in, so  (inaudible) can still widen up.  I think the question is when the ECB comes  in, in two weeks, the entire global rate market is actually watching that.   Now, if political risk is at its peak, can, you know, Draghi actually  tapers, can we talk about rate hikes here?  And that is ...</p><p> KEENE:  If the -- if the E.U. steps in, if the ECB steps in, do you get a  whole feeling of this, everything moves up?</p><p> MISRA:  Yes.  I think if they do taper and -- and the question really is  not so much the pace of tapering, it's when is the next rate hike.  You  know, so if they were to taper but they're not hiking until 2019, I think  then rates really have a sort of less room to move.  But if we're tapering  just over the six-month period, I think then bunds came back up and that's  taking all treasuries with it, gains with it.</p><p> KEENE:  OK.  Priya Misra with us on the fixed income market.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> KEENE:  I want to bring in a book right now, and this is classic Scott  Galloway.  You got the tuition chart here.  The professor from NYU Stern  with the cost of college chart, and then he comes over here and he  observes, I remind myself that NYU are charging kids $500 a minute for me  and a projector.  This is ridiculous, he says, and actually uses French a  little bit skewed towards -- I can't say that on TV.  Now, joining us,  Scott Galloway of NYU and, of course, the book is \"The Four.\"</p><p> What did you learn in writing the book?  A guy as tuned in with you, as  wired in as you, when you write about the four big ones, the DNA of Amazon,  et cetera, et cetera, what was the observation that surprised you?</p><p> SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  That these  countries play by a different set of rules, they're not subject to the same  scrutiny, the rest of businesses that we now worship at the altar of  innovation versus kindness and character.  And there is the way the  business is treated and there's the way that innovators and these tech  companies are treated.</p><p> KEENE:  Will that be snapped at one point?  There's a lot of tension here  right now between on Washington and the -- the glory boys of Silicon  Valley, the glory men and women, I should say, of Silicon Valley.  Is there  a point where those rules will break?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Yes, I think the warm has turned, Tom, and I think the breaking  point was the weaponization by an intelligence unit of the Russian  government of some of these platforms, although I think the regulation or  the fines aren't going to come from where we think they're going to come  from.  I think they're going to come out of the E.U., who registers a lot  of the downside that appears around the privacy, some of the job  destruction, but a fraction of the upside.  We register a lot of benefit  here in the U.S. but the E.U. doesn't.</p><p> KEENE:  You've got great charts in the book that really showed the  dominance under some of the metrics here.  I love this, follow your talent,  not your passion.  What is Jeff Bezos' passion?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Total and complete world domination.  I think we're headed  towards a singularity with Amazon.  I think the consumer stocks, the S&amp;P  500, the most dominant factor now is no longer interest rates, no longer  even the underlying performance of the consumer company itself, but what  Amazon is doing or threatening to do.  Kroger lost a third of its value in  between the time that Amazon announced the acquisition of Whole Foods and  when it closed.  Amazon threatens to go into the drug -- drug business, and  you have drugstores declined 4-5 percent.</p><p> I think Amazon can outperform Jedi mind tricks, and that is look at a  company, just wish ill on it, and begin inflicting pain without even going  into that sector.</p><p> LACQUA:  Scott, congratulations on the book.  I really like Chapter Six.   So this Chapter Six is entitled \"Light Me.\"  And you say stealing is a core  competence of high growth tech firms.  This is I.P. but it is also our  data.</p><p> GALLOWAY: Yes, well, if -- if -- if you think about what these companies  have done and what we're saying to these companies, a fine of a hundred and  sixteen million dollars, Facebook says to the E.U. Commission, \"Don't worry  about our ability to share data between WhatsApp that we're trying to  acquire and the core platforms, as it's impossible.\"  The -- the  acquisition gets approved by the E.U. and then sub-spoiler alert, they  figure it out.  And the E.U. fines them a hundred and sixteen million  dollars on a $19 billion acquisition.  This is the equivalent of a 25-cent  parking tick for a hundred dollar an hour meter.  We have said to these  companies that the smart thing to do for shareholder value is to break the  law and to lie to us.</p><p> LACQUA:  Right.  And -- and that will -- are you suggesting this will  actually continue and there's no, you know, there's no way of avoiding  this?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, I think you're about to see the mother of all fines come  out of Europe.  The -- the regulator who I would argue whose testicles have  descended as Margrethe Vestager.  I think she is the only one that is  really going after these companies.  I don't think the current  administration has the will or the collective I.Q. around technology to  take on big tech.  I think big tech is smarter, has more resources than --  than -- than Washington is able to compete with.  I think the -- the  regulation, the intervention of fines are going to come out of the E.U.</p><p> KEENE:  Everybody is reading this book, I kid you not.  I see it within our  -- our studios here in New York, \"The Four\" by Scott Galloway, and it is  glorious that the TD Securities, Priya Misra, is reading \"The Four.\"  Ask  your question of Professor Galloway, Priya, after what you've ground  through up through chapter this, chapter that.</p><p> MISRA:  Sure.  So I'm not a stock analyst, but I think from a macro  perspective, the point that you highlight is very valuable.  You're getting  these monopolies or oligopolies across industries.  I think from a macro  standpoint, that's keeping inflation pretty low, but my question from 101  Economics is, at some point, they extract monopoly rent.  When does that  happen?  Right now, Whole Foods has -- has sort of kept -- kept inflation  low.  At what point does Amazon take over the world and then we start  seeing higher inflation?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, that's a threat, but to your point, we haven't seen it so  far, because anti-trust law is largely based on, if it's good for the  consumer, we leave them alone.  And it's hard to argue these companies  haven't been good for the consumer.  But when two thirds of all online  growth goes to one player, when the third of all retail growth goes to one  player, and a hundred and four percent of all digital marketing growth goes  to Facebook and Google, meaning, if you're in digital marketing, you don't  work for one of those two companies, you join newspapers and magazines and  that your business is in structural decline, one wonders what happens when  we wake up and we have four to five companies running the consumer economy.</p><p> KEENE:  We're going to micro economics here in honor to Priya Misra,  Priya's question is absolutely brilliant.  There's a tip point where you  flip from the benefits of Amazon over to it being damaging to the greater  industry of any given nation.  You and I know, you and I know, it's not a  tip point, it's not a single point, it's gradual.  And I would suggest,  Scott, it will be expressed through the labor economy.  What do you see now  in the labor economy when I get X number of thousand people lined up in  Fall River, Massachusetts to fill cardboard boxes?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, these companies -- job destructions through innovation is  nothing new.  We've just never seen companies this good at it.  Amazon  needs one person for every two or three that Macy's needs to transact the  same amount of business.  So the -- just the level of job destruction is  incredible.  And look at -- look at the icons of yesterday, Tom, General  Motors, $50 billion in market cap, a quarter of a million, middle-class  households been created, Facebook, $450 billion in market cap, 22,000 jobs.   So we're under the impression there's a lot more people working at these  companies.</p><p> The total population of these four companies would -- could fit in the  Lower East Side, yet it's got the -- the market capitalization, the size of  the GDP of India.  So if you want to talk about an outsized valuation  relative to the number of people, it's staggering.  It's great if you own  real estate in Portola Valley, it's great of you work for one of these  companies.  The question is, is it good for the rest of us?</p><p> LACQUA:  All right.  Scott, the -- the -- you say that basically  (inaudible) the European Commission that really wants to go after a lot of  these big tech firms in terms of data, but there will be a lot more  questions regarding some of the Russia links, as you mentioned briefly, for  example, with Facebook.  How can the tech firms try to keep Washington at  bay?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, I think there's -- I think it depends on the firm.  If I  were on the board of Amazon, I would prophylactically spend aid (ph) of  U.S.  I think they should break themselves up first.  I think with all --  generally, the key to all crisis management is to be seen as over  correcting, so the series of half measures coming out of Facebook saying  they would -- they would hire 250 people and then it's gone to a thousand,  which I would affectionately referred to as pissing in the ocean.  This is  a company that could spend a half a billion dollars on A.I. to identify and  flag content, hire 10,000 people and it might reduce their cash flow by 10  percent.</p><p> We're talking about not the realm of the possible to stop this but the  realm of the profitable.  And they're still claiming it would be  impossible.  Bloomberg wasn't weaponized by Russia, the \"New York Times\"  wasn't weaponized by Russia.  They can absolutely figure this out.  And  they need to skip to that right away.</p><p> KEENE:  Shout Out to Matt Winkler and John Mickelthwait who helped us not  be weaponized by Russia.  We're going to continue this conversation with  Scott Galloway, let's remember his great work with us, his perspective on  Yahoo! and the end of the career for Marissa Mayer.  We're going to  continue with Priya Misra, TD Securities, with us, Mr. Galloway, the book  is \"The Four.\"</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> LACQUA:  Now, let's get more on the story and the future for Uber with  Scott Galloway, he's NYU Stern Marketing professor, he also wrote this  great book called \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and  Google,\" and also Priya Misra of TD Securities in New York.</p><p> Scott, when you look at Uber, so there's quite a lot of allegations against  Uber.  What does Uber need to do now to regain public trust, or do they  need to regain first of all the trust of regulators?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  I think they've taken some key steps, the first is replacing the  CEO with someone who's seen as sort of, you know, adult supervision.  It  feels like the board had two great additions which were put on the board by  Travis, John Thain, Ursula Burns, two incredibly seasoned executives, but  this was a failure on corporate governance.  This was incredibly poor  behaviour.  It became all about the CEO at a point when the company had a  lot of shareholders and families dependent upon the well-being of the  company.  The board is supposed to be adult supervision and (inaudible) and  the board has become until now a place where reputations got to die.  So  get their corporate governance in order, a better CEO, and I think they've  -- I think they've done both of those things.</p><p> KEENE:  You talk about Uber as the fifth horseman, maybe the -- the one  that comes on with the four, and then you walk beautifully through the  history of Uber.  Meghnad Desai at LSE would say one question to Scott  Galloway, are they profitable or does profit not matter to the four or to  the five?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  It's a great point, Tom.  We've -- Amazon has basically taught  the entire ecosystem, that's changed the compact between the market and  investors and that it's replaced profits with vision and leadership.  And  this has snaked all the way back into the private ecosystem.  I ran a  venture back company.  I used to run a venture back company, and the only  way I could raise money was if I -- if I promised to lose more money and  spend more and grow more.</p><p> KEENE:  OK.  Is that one-off or is the Amazon model of avoiding operating  income margins, et cetera, et cetera, is that replicable over to Uber and  to others?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  It appears to be the model that Salesforce is chasing, and I  would argue the entire private markets are now have adopted this  (inaudible) of grow really fast, established leadership, winner take all  regardless of profitability.  And it's becoming -- I don't think this -- I  don't think this -- this song ends well.  But the whole point is grow no  matter what the cost.</p><p> KEENE:  And, Francine, what's critical here -- Francine, what's absolutely  critical here is we don't know how this is going to end.</p><p> LACQUA:  Right.  Which was actually my question to Scott, Tom, is that if  you say, you don't think this is going to end well, what do you mean with  that?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, and Priya might have some thoughts on this.  But the end  of the last, you know, the end of the last century, you know, at one point  when the markets seized up, there, you know -- then the tide went out, if  you -- if -- if, you know, if you will, there are a lot of companies caught  very shorthanded.  And you could probably go through 80 percent of the C  startups right now and they're losing money.</p><p> KEENE:  I got eight ways to go here.  Priya, I'm going to -- jump in here.   Is his world like this?  Could he write the book, \"The Four,\" because your  world's given us money for free?  I mean, money for free, right?</p><p> MISRA:  That's the spare point, yes, I think (inaudible) capital is very  low.  But it's -- it's a key point, yes, productivity pick up.  And I think  all this big economy, and people look at what's happening with the four or  five and say, look, productivity is pretty high, there's a lot of  innovation.  So even though the aggregate numbers look low, don't worry,  it's actually going to pick up.  Well, it may not pick up because the  innovation is only happening in these four or five.  On an average, I'm not  sure productivity is picking up.</p><p> KEENE:  Two quick questions, is your world good for her India?  She's one  of the elite of India coming out of their academics.  Is the four and the  five and the six, India is going to be dominant over China in 20 years.  Is  your world good for India?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  What's interesting is if you look at China, the lesson there is  don't let these companies in, steal their IPE and then capture the economic  value yourself, and you hate to say that.  But if you're Italy, do you let  these guys in, let them destroy your media, your -- your ad jobs and let a  lot of shareholder value flow out, or do you adopt the Chinese model of  benchmarking and taking it for yourself?</p><p> KEENE:  Ten second, Yahoo!'s future?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  It's -- it's done.  It's -- it's where it should be, it's been  traded up to a better company and it's going to be, you know, it's going to  be a moment in time and that it's done.</p><p> KEENE:  Scott Galloway, your (inaudible) never going to be winner in New  York.  It's going to be summer forever, \"The Four,\" there it is, Scott  Galloway, New York University.  Priya Misra will continue with us.  Mr.  Galloway has to take Uber downtown to NYU.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> KEENE:  Let's get to our single best chart quickly here.  Priya Misra of TD  Securities, it's the 10-year yield and the great moderation back to 1980.   Over here, the two yellow lines are maybe the land of a view of the end of  the great moderation.  Mr. Gross was here at 2.60 percent as a key  indicator, and he brought that down to a key level of 2.4 percent.  I know  you don't want to parse that narrow, Priya, but the idea of not a lift in  rates but just a chronic steadiness of higher rates is of more interest,  isn't it?</p><p> MISRA:  Yes, definitely.  We're definitely in that (inaudible), that it's - - it's a lower bend, you know, whether it's (inaudible).</p><p> KEENE:  And Bill said that as well.  He didn't predict Walter Heller rates.</p><p> MISRA:  So I think the -- the argument for that is that our star or neutral  rate is actually much lower.  Part of that is inflation, part of that I  would argue is even real rates, neutral real rates are lower globally.   You're looking at a decline in -- in demographics, you're certainly looking  at a decline in productivity that I think is actually far more structured  than this idea that we're just not measuring it right, and I think central  banks have sort of won the war on inflation, and then some, I think that  someone would actually like more inflation than they have.  So if you --  you know, this is a global issue -- yes?</p><p> LACQUA:  So if it's structural, what does that mean?</p><p> MISRA:  It means that, you know, we'll be perpetually waiting for that  productivity lift, so I think central banks will normalize to a point, and  then they'll wait for that productivity lift to actually take the -- the --  the funds rate higher, and that's when they struggle.  So I think globally,  you're seeing this effort towards normalization.  That's why the dollar is  doing what it's doing.  And then I think we're going to be in this band,  and you know, potentially waiting for the next recession.  But you don't  have to have a recession.  You can just sort of be at equilibrium at one  and a half percent real GDP, for example, for the U.S.</p><p> KEENE:  A done deal, is December a done deal or do they move it to  November?  I mean, why not move it to November and get it done with?</p><p> MISRA:  Well, the market is not at all priced for November.  So they have  to tell us today in the minutes that they're very close to November.   You've got a press -- press conference, you've also got the SEP, so once  you get the projections in December and the Fed says, look, we're looking  for inflation to pick up, I think they could justify a hike.</p><p> KEENE:  I'm glad you mentioned that, and we'll look for the minutes this  afternoon, and some value.  Priya Misra with us with TD Securities, thank  you so much.  She'll continue with us with David Gura on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

We got Andrew Sheets on earlier, a little bit more of an equity angle, here with bonds, Priya Misra is with TD Securities and the head of all of their rates strategy, as well.</p><p>Are we in a normal rate environment? The answer is, this has changed, this has changed, this has changed, but your world is still not normal, is it?</p><p>PRIYA MISRA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RATES STRATEGY, TD SECURITIES: I think if you try and decompose interest rates into set of central bank expectations and term premium, we're in a new normal over that term premium is concerned. There's a lot of money chasing yield. And so, you know, treasuries at 2.30 are actually pretty cheap if you compare with bunds or -- or you compare with JGB, so I think that's sort of the new normal we're in. When it's very hard, I think, for bond yields to rise even with central banks normalizing, if you got this very large balance sheet and global rates staying low. So I think that's the new normal here.</p><p>KEENE: OK. Well, Francine just brought this up, let's pull economics into Priya Misra's world. Bring this up in the wall. This -- we can't send this out the way the (inaudible) are set up. This is the Taylor rule that Francine was showing earlier. And here's the soup (ph) down here. These are the equations that Priya memorized in Bangalore when she took her masters. Here is Nehru right here. Now, that's a Ned Phelps kind of economic number there. What is your belief on the system and the idea that rates could nudge up as Bill Gross talks about when you look at the demographic realities of something like Nehru?</p><p>MISRA: I think Nehru is at the (inaudible) in observable quantity. We all tried to estimate it. The Fed, I think, has struggled. The (inaudible) of Nehru significantly.</p><p>KEENE: Does it signal lower interest rates sustained, or is Bill Gross right, the great moderation is ebbing away and we may go with higher rates?</p><p>MISRA: I'm not entirely convinced that -- that it's -- it's sort of ebbing away. And the -- I guess the main reason is that if -- if you look at structural forces, productivity is very low, wage inflation, despite the fact, you were just talking about juries, the labor market is on fire, we still haven't had any wage inflation, really. So, you know, you're not seeing wage inflation, you're seeing PCE actually head lower, we're estimating we'll continuing to head lower over the next six months. So whatever your estimate of Nehru is, you know, it's probably lower than what we've all thought. And that should mean that the neutral rate for The Fed or where the hiking cycle ends is actually much lower than historical.</p><p>So we may see a little bit of ebbing away, I think interest rates can certainly rise, 25-30 basis points, we're not talking a hundred basis points.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Right. But, Priya, once the Fed hikes, is this now, you know, a stronger sustained trend? And are they right to focus on stability? You can argue that actually a lot of the indicators point to stability and they are preferring that to actually looking at that inflation given what you just said about PCE?</p><p>MISRA: Right. That's a fair point. I think we start to struggle with whether that's the reason why the Fed wants to normalize here. There is no reason for the inflation point for them to continue to hike. I think that it's -- it's partly there, but the Fed, I think, at least, under the current leadership does want to focus on sort of macro prudential reasons or -- or -- or tools to actually control financial stability and use monetary policy specifically for the economy, but I think your question becomes very valid once we're at a zero real rate. So once the Fed has normalized, now they've certainly started normalizing the balance sheet, once they think we're at some normal interest rate, not neutral, but normal, I think then the question becomes, what's the catalyst to continue to tighten, you know, maybe financial conditions will -- will become important then. I think that's where Fed leadership becomes significantly important, which we know is -- is entirely influx here.</p><p>LACQUA: So what would be the catalyst to tighten, Priya? And is -- and do -- you know, should they worry about distortion, for example, in the markets?</p><p>MISRA: You know, I think to an extent, they are still normalizing. I still think that they should use macro prudential tools, now, you know, the tool -- the -- the Fed does have the regulatory site. If they ease that significantly, and certainly with -- with Randy Quarles, with, you know -- if we you see significant easing off of financial regulation, I think then the Fed absolutely should take that into account.</p><p>KEENE: Priya Misra with us, and we'll continue this discussion linking in fixed income into the (inaudible), particularly for the markets, and we saw that 22,800 on the Dow yesterday.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Watching on our set, Priya Misra of TD Securities, and within full faith in credit and sovereign debt within the United States, this goes to the opportunity to buy more beleaguered with the stress yield. But I keep hearing this phrase in your literature and others of record tight where the -- the -- the U.S. yield is here or the U.K. yield is here, and things like Catalonia, the yield comes in. Is that still where we are?</p><p>MISRA: I think we are. But when it comes to political risk, I think that's very difficult to price. So I'm not sure you're supposed to be buying Spanish bonds just yet. I mean, the market has corrected significantly, we're not at any wide levels for Spain. I mean, if 1.55 is triggered, I think you get a lot more political risk getting priced in, so (inaudible) can still widen up. I think the question is when the ECB comes in, in two weeks, the entire global rate market is actually watching that. Now, if political risk is at its peak, can, you know, Draghi actually tapers, can we talk about rate hikes here? And that is ...</p><p>KEENE: If the -- if the E.U. steps in, if the ECB steps in, do you get a whole feeling of this, everything moves up?</p><p>MISRA: Yes. I think if they do taper and -- and the question really is not so much the pace of tapering, it's when is the next rate hike. You know, so if they were to taper but they're not hiking until 2019, I think then rates really have a sort of less room to move. But if we're tapering just over the six-month period, I think then bunds came back up and that's taking all treasuries with it, gains with it.</p><p>KEENE: OK. Priya Misra with us on the fixed income market.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: I want to bring in a book right now, and this is classic Scott Galloway. You got the tuition chart here. The professor from NYU Stern with the cost of college chart, and then he comes over here and he observes, I remind myself that NYU are charging kids $500 a minute for me and a projector. This is ridiculous, he says, and actually uses French a little bit skewed towards -- I can't say that on TV. Now, joining us, Scott Galloway of NYU and, of course, the book is \"The Four.\"</p><p>What did you learn in writing the book? A guy as tuned in with you, as wired in as you, when you write about the four big ones, the DNA of Amazon, et cetera, et cetera, what was the observation that surprised you?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: That these countries play by a different set of rules, they're not subject to the same scrutiny, the rest of businesses that we now worship at the altar of innovation versus kindness and character. And there is the way the business is treated and there's the way that innovators and these tech companies are treated.</p><p>KEENE: Will that be snapped at one point? There's a lot of tension here right now between on Washington and the -- the glory boys of Silicon Valley, the glory men and women, I should say, of Silicon Valley. Is there a point where those rules will break?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, I think the warm has turned, Tom, and I think the breaking point was the weaponization by an intelligence unit of the Russian government of some of these platforms, although I think the regulation or the fines aren't going to come from where we think they're going to come from. I think they're going to come out of the E.U., who registers a lot of the downside that appears around the privacy, some of the job destruction, but a fraction of the upside. We register a lot of benefit here in the U.S. but the E.U. doesn't.</p><p>KEENE: You've got great charts in the book that really showed the dominance under some of the metrics here. I love this, follow your talent, not your passion. What is Jeff Bezos' passion?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Total and complete world domination. I think we're headed towards a singularity with Amazon. I think the consumer stocks, the S&amp;P 500, the most dominant factor now is no longer interest rates, no longer even the underlying performance of the consumer company itself, but what Amazon is doing or threatening to do. Kroger lost a third of its value in between the time that Amazon announced the acquisition of Whole Foods and when it closed. Amazon threatens to go into the drug -- drug business, and you have drugstores declined 4-5 percent.</p><p>I think Amazon can outperform Jedi mind tricks, and that is look at a company, just wish ill on it, and begin inflicting pain without even going into that sector.</p><p>LACQUA: Scott, congratulations on the book. I really like Chapter Six. So this Chapter Six is entitled \"Light Me.\" And you say stealing is a core competence of high growth tech firms. This is I.P. but it is also our data.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, well, if -- if -- if you think about what these companies have done and what we're saying to these companies, a fine of a hundred and sixteen million dollars, Facebook says to the E.U. Commission, \"Don't worry about our ability to share data between WhatsApp that we're trying to acquire and the core platforms, as it's impossible.\" The -- the acquisition gets approved by the E.U. and then sub-spoiler alert, they figure it out. And the E.U. fines them a hundred and sixteen million dollars on a $19 billion acquisition. This is the equivalent of a 25-cent parking tick for a hundred dollar an hour meter. We have said to these companies that the smart thing to do for shareholder value is to break the law and to lie to us.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. And -- and that will -- are you suggesting this will actually continue and there's no, you know, there's no way of avoiding this?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, I think you're about to see the mother of all fines come out of Europe. The -- the regulator who I would argue whose testicles have descended as Margrethe Vestager. I think she is the only one that is really going after these companies. I don't think the current administration has the will or the collective I.Q. around technology to take on big tech. I think big tech is smarter, has more resources than -- than -- than Washington is able to compete with. I think the -- the regulation, the intervention of fines are going to come out of the E.U.</p><p>KEENE: Everybody is reading this book, I kid you not. I see it within our -- our studios here in New York, \"The Four\" by Scott Galloway, and it is glorious that the TD Securities, Priya Misra, is reading \"The Four.\" Ask your question of Professor Galloway, Priya, after what you've ground through up through chapter this, chapter that.</p><p>MISRA: Sure. So I'm not a stock analyst, but I think from a macro perspective, the point that you highlight is very valuable. You're getting these monopolies or oligopolies across industries. I think from a macro standpoint, that's keeping inflation pretty low, but my question from 101 Economics is, at some point, they extract monopoly rent. When does that happen? Right now, Whole Foods has -- has sort of kept -- kept inflation low. At what point does Amazon take over the world and then we start seeing higher inflation?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, that's a threat, but to your point, we haven't seen it so far, because anti-trust law is largely based on, if it's good for the consumer, we leave them alone. And it's hard to argue these companies haven't been good for the consumer. But when two thirds of all online growth goes to one player, when the third of all retail growth goes to one player, and a hundred and four percent of all digital marketing growth goes to Facebook and Google, meaning, if you're in digital marketing, you don't work for one of those two companies, you join newspapers and magazines and that your business is in structural decline, one wonders what happens when we wake up and we have four to five companies running the consumer economy.</p><p>KEENE: We're going to micro economics here in honor to Priya Misra, Priya's question is absolutely brilliant. There's a tip point where you flip from the benefits of Amazon over to it being damaging to the greater industry of any given nation. You and I know, you and I know, it's not a tip point, it's not a single point, it's gradual. And I would suggest, Scott, it will be expressed through the labor economy. What do you see now in the labor economy when I get X number of thousand people lined up in Fall River, Massachusetts to fill cardboard boxes?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, these companies -- job destructions through innovation is nothing new. We've just never seen companies this good at it. Amazon needs one person for every two or three that Macy's needs to transact the same amount of business. So the -- just the level of job destruction is incredible. And look at -- look at the icons of yesterday, Tom, General Motors, $50 billion in market cap, a quarter of a million, middle-class households been created, Facebook, $450 billion in market cap, 22,000 jobs. So we're under the impression there's a lot more people working at these companies.</p><p>The total population of these four companies would -- could fit in the Lower East Side, yet it's got the -- the market capitalization, the size of the GDP of India. So if you want to talk about an outsized valuation relative to the number of people, it's staggering. It's great if you own real estate in Portola Valley, it's great of you work for one of these companies. The question is, is it good for the rest of us?</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Scott, the -- the -- you say that basically (inaudible) the European Commission that really wants to go after a lot of these big tech firms in terms of data, but there will be a lot more questions regarding some of the Russia links, as you mentioned briefly, for example, with Facebook. How can the tech firms try to keep Washington at bay?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, I think there's -- I think it depends on the firm. If I were on the board of Amazon, I would prophylactically spend aid (ph) of U.S. I think they should break themselves up first. I think with all -- generally, the key to all crisis management is to be seen as over correcting, so the series of half measures coming out of Facebook saying they would -- they would hire 250 people and then it's gone to a thousand, which I would affectionately referred to as pissing in the ocean. This is a company that could spend a half a billion dollars on A.I. to identify and flag content, hire 10,000 people and it might reduce their cash flow by 10 percent.</p><p>We're talking about not the realm of the possible to stop this but the realm of the profitable. And they're still claiming it would be impossible. Bloomberg wasn't weaponized by Russia, the \"New York Times\" wasn't weaponized by Russia. They can absolutely figure this out. And they need to skip to that right away.</p><p>KEENE: Shout Out to Matt Winkler and John Mickelthwait who helped us not be weaponized by Russia. We're going to continue this conversation with Scott Galloway, let's remember his great work with us, his perspective on Yahoo! and the end of the career for Marissa Mayer. We're going to continue with Priya Misra, TD Securities, with us, Mr. Galloway, the book is \"The Four.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Now, let's get more on the story and the future for Uber with Scott Galloway, he's NYU Stern Marketing professor, he also wrote this great book called \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,\" and also Priya Misra of TD Securities in New York.</p><p>Scott, when you look at Uber, so there's quite a lot of allegations against Uber. What does Uber need to do now to regain public trust, or do they need to regain first of all the trust of regulators?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I think they've taken some key steps, the first is replacing the CEO with someone who's seen as sort of, you know, adult supervision. It feels like the board had two great additions which were put on the board by Travis, John Thain, Ursula Burns, two incredibly seasoned executives, but this was a failure on corporate governance. This was incredibly poor behaviour. It became all about the CEO at a point when the company had a lot of shareholders and families dependent upon the well-being of the company. The board is supposed to be adult supervision and (inaudible) and the board has become until now a place where reputations got to die. So get their corporate governance in order, a better CEO, and I think they've -- I think they've done both of those things.</p><p>KEENE: You talk about Uber as the fifth horseman, maybe the -- the one that comes on with the four, and then you walk beautifully through the history of Uber. Meghnad Desai at LSE would say one question to Scott Galloway, are they profitable or does profit not matter to the four or to the five?</p><p>GALLOWAY: It's a great point, Tom. We've -- Amazon has basically taught the entire ecosystem, that's changed the compact between the market and investors and that it's replaced profits with vision and leadership. And this has snaked all the way back into the private ecosystem. I ran a venture back company. I used to run a venture back company, and the only way I could raise money was if I -- if I promised to lose more money and spend more and grow more.</p><p>KEENE: OK. Is that one-off or is the Amazon model of avoiding operating income margins, et cetera, et cetera, is that replicable over to Uber and to others?</p><p>GALLOWAY: It appears to be the model that Salesforce is chasing, and I would argue the entire private markets are now have adopted this (inaudible) of grow really fast, established leadership, winner take all regardless of profitability. And it's becoming -- I don't think this -- I don't think this -- this song ends well. But the whole point is grow no matter what the cost.</p><p>KEENE: And, Francine, what's critical here -- Francine, what's absolutely critical here is we don't know how this is going to end.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. Which was actually my question to Scott, Tom, is that if you say, you don't think this is going to end well, what do you mean with that?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, and Priya might have some thoughts on this. But the end of the last, you know, the end of the last century, you know, at one point when the markets seized up, there, you know -- then the tide went out, if you -- if -- if, you know, if you will, there are a lot of companies caught very shorthanded. And you could probably go through 80 percent of the C startups right now and they're losing money.</p><p>KEENE: I got eight ways to go here. Priya, I'm going to -- jump in here. Is his world like this? Could he write the book, \"The Four,\" because your world's given us money for free? I mean, money for free, right?</p><p>MISRA: That's the spare point, yes, I think (inaudible) capital is very low. But it's -- it's a key point, yes, productivity pick up. And I think all this big economy, and people look at what's happening with the four or five and say, look, productivity is pretty high, there's a lot of innovation. So even though the aggregate numbers look low, don't worry, it's actually going to pick up. Well, it may not pick up because the innovation is only happening in these four or five. On an average, I'm not sure productivity is picking up.</p><p>KEENE: Two quick questions, is your world good for her India? She's one of the elite of India coming out of their academics. Is the four and the five and the six, India is going to be dominant over China in 20 years. Is your world good for India?</p><p>GALLOWAY: What's interesting is if you look at China, the lesson there is don't let these companies in, steal their IPE and then capture the economic value yourself, and you hate to say that. But if you're Italy, do you let these guys in, let them destroy your media, your -- your ad jobs and let a lot of shareholder value flow out, or do you adopt the Chinese model of benchmarking and taking it for yourself?</p><p>KEENE: Ten second, Yahoo!'s future?</p><p>GALLOWAY: It's -- it's done. It's -- it's where it should be, it's been traded up to a better company and it's going to be, you know, it's going to be a moment in time and that it's done.</p><p>KEENE: Scott Galloway, your (inaudible) never going to be winner in New York. It's going to be summer forever, \"The Four,\" there it is, Scott Galloway, New York University. Priya Misra will continue with us. Mr. Galloway has to take Uber downtown to NYU.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Let's get to our single best chart quickly here. Priya Misra of TD Securities, it's the 10-year yield and the great moderation back to 1980. Over here, the two yellow lines are maybe the land of a view of the end of the great moderation. Mr. Gross was here at 2.60 percent as a key indicator, and he brought that down to a key level of 2.4 percent. I know you don't want to parse that narrow, Priya, but the idea of not a lift in rates but just a chronic steadiness of higher rates is of more interest, isn't it?</p><p>MISRA: Yes, definitely. We're definitely in that (inaudible), that it's - - it's a lower bend, you know, whether it's (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: And Bill said that as well. He didn't predict Walter Heller rates.</p><p>MISRA: So I think the -- the argument for that is that our star or neutral rate is actually much lower. Part of that is inflation, part of that I would argue is even real rates, neutral real rates are lower globally. You're looking at a decline in -- in demographics, you're certainly looking at a decline in productivity that I think is actually far more structured than this idea that we're just not measuring it right, and I think central banks have sort of won the war on inflation, and then some, I think that someone would actually like more inflation than they have. So if you -- you know, this is a global issue -- yes?</p><p>LACQUA: So if it's structural, what does that mean?</p><p>MISRA: It means that, you know, we'll be perpetually waiting for that productivity lift, so I think central banks will normalize to a point, and then they'll wait for that productivity lift to actually take the -- the -- the funds rate higher, and that's when they struggle. So I think globally, you're seeing this effort towards normalization. That's why the dollar is doing what it's doing. And then I think we're going to be in this band, and you know, potentially waiting for the next recession. But you don't have to have a recession. You can just sort of be at equilibrium at one and a half percent real GDP, for example, for the U.S.</p><p>KEENE: A done deal, is December a done deal or do they move it to November? I mean, why not move it to November and get it done with?</p><p>MISRA: Well, the market is not at all priced for November. So they have to tell us today in the minutes that they're very close to November. You've got a press -- press conference, you've also got the SEP, so once you get the projections in December and the Fed says, look, we're looking for inflation to pick up, I think they could justify a hike.</p><p>KEENE: I'm glad you mentioned that, and we'll look for the minutes this afternoon, and some value. Priya Misra with us with TD Securities, thank you so much. She'll continue with us with David Gura on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

We got Andrew Sheets on  earlier, a little bit more of an equity angle, here with bonds, Priya Misra  is with TD Securities and the head of all of their rates strategy, as well.</p><p>Are we in a normal rate environment?  The answer is, this has changed, this  has changed, this has changed, but your world is still not normal, is it?</p><p>PRIYA MISRA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RATES STRATEGY, TD SECURITIES:  I think if you  try and decompose interest rates into set of central bank expectations and  term premium, we're in a new normal over that term premium is concerned.   There's a lot of money chasing yield.  And so, you know, treasuries at 2.30  are actually pretty cheap if you compare with bunds or -- or you compare  with JGB, so I think that's sort of the new normal we're in.  When it's  very hard, I think, for bond yields to rise even with central banks  normalizing, if you got this very large balance sheet and global rates  staying low.  So I think that's the new normal here.</p><p>KEENE:  OK.  Well, Francine just brought this up, let's pull economics into  Priya Misra's world.  Bring this up in the wall.  This -- we can't send  this out the way the (inaudible) are set up.  This is the Taylor rule that  Francine was showing earlier.  And here's the soup (ph) down here.  These  are the equations that Priya memorized in Bangalore when she took her  masters.  Here is Nehru right here.  Now, that's a Ned Phelps kind of  economic number there.  What is your belief on the system and the idea that  rates could nudge up as Bill Gross talks about when you look at the  demographic realities of something like Nehru?</p><p>MISRA:  I think Nehru is at the (inaudible) in observable quantity.  We all  tried to estimate it.  The Fed, I think, has struggled.  The (inaudible) of  Nehru significantly.</p><p>KEENE:  Does it signal lower interest rates sustained, or is Bill Gross  right, the great moderation is ebbing away and we may go with higher rates?</p><p>MISRA:  I'm not entirely convinced that -- that it's -- it's sort of ebbing  away.  And the -- I guess the main reason is that if -- if you look at  structural forces, productivity is very low, wage inflation, despite the  fact, you were just talking about juries, the labor market is on fire, we  still haven't had any wage inflation, really.  So, you know, you're not  seeing wage inflation, you're seeing PCE actually head lower, we're  estimating we'll continuing to head lower over the next six months.  So  whatever your estimate of Nehru is, you know, it's probably lower than what  we've all thought.  And that should mean that the neutral rate for The Fed  or where the hiking cycle ends is actually much lower than historical.</p><p>So we may see a little bit of ebbing away, I think interest rates can  certainly rise, 25-30 basis points, we're not talking a hundred basis  points.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG NEWS:  Right.  But, Priya, once the Fed hikes,  is this now, you know, a stronger sustained trend?  And are they right to  focus on stability?  You can argue that actually a lot of the indicators  point to stability and they are preferring that to actually looking at that  inflation given what you just said about PCE?</p><p>MISRA:  Right.  That's a fair point.  I think we start to struggle with  whether that's the reason why the Fed wants to normalize here.  There is no  reason for the inflation point for them to continue to hike.  I think that  it's -- it's partly there, but the Fed, I think, at least, under the  current leadership does want to focus on sort of macro prudential reasons  or -- or -- or tools to actually control financial stability and use  monetary policy specifically for the economy, but I think your question  becomes very valid once we're at a zero real rate.  So once the Fed has  normalized, now they've certainly started normalizing the balance sheet,  once they think we're at some normal interest rate, not neutral, but  normal, I think then the question becomes, what's the catalyst to continue  to tighten, you know, maybe financial conditions will -- will become  important then.  I think that's where Fed leadership becomes significantly  important, which we know is -- is entirely influx here.</p><p>LACQUA:  So what would be the catalyst to tighten, Priya?  And is -- and do  -- you know, should they worry about distortion, for example, in the  markets?</p><p>MISRA:  You know, I think to an extent, they are still normalizing.  I  still think that they should use macro prudential tools, now, you know, the  tool -- the -- the Fed does have the regulatory site.  If they ease that  significantly, and certainly with -- with Randy Quarles, with, you know --  if we you see significant easing off of financial regulation, I think then  the Fed absolutely should take that into account.</p><p>KEENE:  Priya Misra with us, and we'll continue this discussion linking in  fixed income into the (inaudible), particularly for the markets, and we saw  that 22,800 on the Dow yesterday.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  Watching on our set, Priya Misra of TD Securities, and within full  faith in credit and sovereign debt within the United States, this goes to  the opportunity to buy more beleaguered with the stress yield.  But I keep  hearing this phrase in your literature and others of record tight where the  -- the -- the U.S. yield is here or the U.K. yield is here, and things like  Catalonia, the yield comes in.  Is that still where we are?</p><p>MISRA:  I think we are.  But when it comes to political risk, I think  that's very difficult to price.  So I'm not sure you're supposed to be  buying Spanish bonds just yet.  I mean, the market has corrected  significantly, we're not at any wide levels for Spain.  I mean, if 1.55 is  triggered, I think you get a lot more political risk getting priced in, so  (inaudible) can still widen up.  I think the question is when the ECB comes  in, in two weeks, the entire global rate market is actually watching that.   Now, if political risk is at its peak, can, you know, Draghi actually  tapers, can we talk about rate hikes here?  And that is ...</p><p>KEENE:  If the -- if the E.U. steps in, if the ECB steps in, do you get a  whole feeling of this, everything moves up?</p><p>MISRA:  Yes.  I think if they do taper and -- and the question really is  not so much the pace of tapering, it's when is the next rate hike.  You  know, so if they were to taper but they're not hiking until 2019, I think  then rates really have a sort of less room to move.  But if we're tapering  just over the six-month period, I think then bunds came back up and that's  taking all treasuries with it, gains with it.</p><p>KEENE:  OK.  Priya Misra with us on the fixed income market.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  I want to bring in a book right now, and this is classic Scott  Galloway.  You got the tuition chart here.  The professor from NYU Stern  with the cost of college chart, and then he comes over here and he  observes, I remind myself that NYU are charging kids $500 a minute for me  and a projector.  This is ridiculous, he says, and actually uses French a  little bit skewed towards -- I can't say that on TV.  Now, joining us,  Scott Galloway of NYU and, of course, the book is \"The Four.\"</p><p>What did you learn in writing the book?  A guy as tuned in with you, as  wired in as you, when you write about the four big ones, the DNA of Amazon,  et cetera, et cetera, what was the observation that surprised you?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  That these  countries play by a different set of rules, they're not subject to the same  scrutiny, the rest of businesses that we now worship at the altar of  innovation versus kindness and character.  And there is the way the  business is treated and there's the way that innovators and these tech  companies are treated.</p><p>KEENE:  Will that be snapped at one point?  There's a lot of tension here  right now between on Washington and the -- the glory boys of Silicon  Valley, the glory men and women, I should say, of Silicon Valley.  Is there  a point where those rules will break?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Yes, I think the warm has turned, Tom, and I think the breaking  point was the weaponization by an intelligence unit of the Russian  government of some of these platforms, although I think the regulation or  the fines aren't going to come from where we think they're going to come  from.  I think they're going to come out of the E.U., who registers a lot  of the downside that appears around the privacy, some of the job  destruction, but a fraction of the upside.  We register a lot of benefit  here in the U.S. but the E.U. doesn't.</p><p>KEENE:  You've got great charts in the book that really showed the  dominance under some of the metrics here.  I love this, follow your talent,  not your passion.  What is Jeff Bezos' passion?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Total and complete world domination.  I think we're headed  towards a singularity with Amazon.  I think the consumer stocks, the S&amp;P  500, the most dominant factor now is no longer interest rates, no longer  even the underlying performance of the consumer company itself, but what  Amazon is doing or threatening to do.  Kroger lost a third of its value in  between the time that Amazon announced the acquisition of Whole Foods and  when it closed.  Amazon threatens to go into the drug -- drug business, and  you have drugstores declined 4-5 percent.</p><p>I think Amazon can outperform Jedi mind tricks, and that is look at a  company, just wish ill on it, and begin inflicting pain without even going  into that sector.</p><p>LACQUA:  Scott, congratulations on the book.  I really like Chapter Six.   So this Chapter Six is entitled \"Light Me.\"  And you say stealing is a core  competence of high growth tech firms.  This is I.P. but it is also our  data.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, well, if -- if -- if you think about what these companies  have done and what we're saying to these companies, a fine of a hundred and  sixteen million dollars, Facebook says to the E.U. Commission, \"Don't worry  about our ability to share data between WhatsApp that we're trying to  acquire and the core platforms, as it's impossible.\"  The -- the  acquisition gets approved by the E.U. and then sub-spoiler alert, they  figure it out.  And the E.U. fines them a hundred and sixteen million  dollars on a $19 billion acquisition.  This is the equivalent of a 25-cent  parking tick for a hundred dollar an hour meter.  We have said to these  companies that the smart thing to do for shareholder value is to break the  law and to lie to us.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right.  And -- and that will -- are you suggesting this will  actually continue and there's no, you know, there's no way of avoiding  this?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, I think you're about to see the mother of all fines come  out of Europe.  The -- the regulator who I would argue whose testicles have  descended as Margrethe Vestager.  I think she is the only one that is  really going after these companies.  I don't think the current  administration has the will or the collective I.Q. around technology to  take on big tech.  I think big tech is smarter, has more resources than --  than -- than Washington is able to compete with.  I think the -- the  regulation, the intervention of fines are going to come out of the E.U.</p><p>KEENE:  Everybody is reading this book, I kid you not.  I see it within our  -- our studios here in New York, \"The Four\" by Scott Galloway, and it is  glorious that the TD Securities, Priya Misra, is reading \"The Four.\"  Ask  your question of Professor Galloway, Priya, after what you've ground  through up through chapter this, chapter that.</p><p>MISRA:  Sure.  So I'm not a stock analyst, but I think from a macro  perspective, the point that you highlight is very valuable.  You're getting  these monopolies or oligopolies across industries.  I think from a macro  standpoint, that's keeping inflation pretty low, but my question from 101  Economics is, at some point, they extract monopoly rent.  When does that  happen?  Right now, Whole Foods has -- has sort of kept -- kept inflation  low.  At what point does Amazon take over the world and then we start  seeing higher inflation?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, that's a threat, but to your point, we haven't seen it so  far, because anti-trust law is largely based on, if it's good for the  consumer, we leave them alone.  And it's hard to argue these companies  haven't been good for the consumer.  But when two thirds of all online  growth goes to one player, when the third of all retail growth goes to one  player, and a hundred and four percent of all digital marketing growth goes  to Facebook and Google, meaning, if you're in digital marketing, you don't  work for one of those two companies, you join newspapers and magazines and  that your business is in structural decline, one wonders what happens when  we wake up and we have four to five companies running the consumer economy.</p><p>KEENE:  We're going to micro economics here in honor to Priya Misra,  Priya's question is absolutely brilliant.  There's a tip point where you  flip from the benefits of Amazon over to it being damaging to the greater  industry of any given nation.  You and I know, you and I know, it's not a  tip point, it's not a single point, it's gradual.  And I would suggest,  Scott, it will be expressed through the labor economy.  What do you see now  in the labor economy when I get X number of thousand people lined up in  Fall River, Massachusetts to fill cardboard boxes?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, these companies -- job destructions through innovation is  nothing new.  We've just never seen companies this good at it.  Amazon  needs one person for every two or three that Macy's needs to transact the  same amount of business.  So the -- just the level of job destruction is  incredible.  And look at -- look at the icons of yesterday, Tom, General  Motors, $50 billion in market cap, a quarter of a million, middle-class  households been created, Facebook, $450 billion in market cap, 22,000 jobs.   So we're under the impression there's a lot more people working at these  companies.</p><p>The total population of these four companies would -- could fit in the  Lower East Side, yet it's got the -- the market capitalization, the size of  the GDP of India.  So if you want to talk about an outsized valuation  relative to the number of people, it's staggering.  It's great if you own  real estate in Portola Valley, it's great of you work for one of these  companies.  The question is, is it good for the rest of us?</p><p>LACQUA:  All right.  Scott, the -- the -- you say that basically  (inaudible) the European Commission that really wants to go after a lot of  these big tech firms in terms of data, but there will be a lot more  questions regarding some of the Russia links, as you mentioned briefly, for  example, with Facebook.  How can the tech firms try to keep Washington at  bay?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, I think there's -- I think it depends on the firm.  If I  were on the board of Amazon, I would prophylactically spend aid (ph) of  U.S.  I think they should break themselves up first.  I think with all --  generally, the key to all crisis management is to be seen as over  correcting, so the series of half measures coming out of Facebook saying  they would -- they would hire 250 people and then it's gone to a thousand,  which I would affectionately referred to as pissing in the ocean.  This is  a company that could spend a half a billion dollars on A.I. to identify and  flag content, hire 10,000 people and it might reduce their cash flow by 10  percent.</p><p>We're talking about not the realm of the possible to stop this but the  realm of the profitable.  And they're still claiming it would be  impossible.  Bloomberg wasn't weaponized by Russia, the \"New York Times\"  wasn't weaponized by Russia.  They can absolutely figure this out.  And  they need to skip to that right away.</p><p>KEENE:  Shout Out to Matt Winkler and John Mickelthwait who helped us not  be weaponized by Russia.  We're going to continue this conversation with  Scott Galloway, let's remember his great work with us, his perspective on  Yahoo! and the end of the career for Marissa Mayer.  We're going to  continue with Priya Misra, TD Securities, with us, Mr. Galloway, the book  is \"The Four.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA:  Now, let's get more on the story and the future for Uber with  Scott Galloway, he's NYU Stern Marketing professor, he also wrote this  great book called \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and  Google,\" and also Priya Misra of TD Securities in New York.</p><p>Scott, when you look at Uber, so there's quite a lot of allegations against  Uber.  What does Uber need to do now to regain public trust, or do they  need to regain first of all the trust of regulators?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  I think they've taken some key steps, the first is replacing the  CEO with someone who's seen as sort of, you know, adult supervision.  It  feels like the board had two great additions which were put on the board by  Travis, John Thain, Ursula Burns, two incredibly seasoned executives, but  this was a failure on corporate governance.  This was incredibly poor  behaviour.  It became all about the CEO at a point when the company had a  lot of shareholders and families dependent upon the well-being of the  company.  The board is supposed to be adult supervision and (inaudible) and  the board has become until now a place where reputations got to die.  So  get their corporate governance in order, a better CEO, and I think they've  -- I think they've done both of those things.</p><p>KEENE:  You talk about Uber as the fifth horseman, maybe the -- the one  that comes on with the four, and then you walk beautifully through the  history of Uber.  Meghnad Desai at LSE would say one question to Scott  Galloway, are they profitable or does profit not matter to the four or to  the five?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  It's a great point, Tom.  We've -- Amazon has basically taught  the entire ecosystem, that's changed the compact between the market and  investors and that it's replaced profits with vision and leadership.  And  this has snaked all the way back into the private ecosystem.  I ran a  venture back company.  I used to run a venture back company, and the only  way I could raise money was if I -- if I promised to lose more money and  spend more and grow more.</p><p>KEENE:  OK.  Is that one-off or is the Amazon model of avoiding operating  income margins, et cetera, et cetera, is that replicable over to Uber and  to others?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  It appears to be the model that Salesforce is chasing, and I  would argue the entire private markets are now have adopted this  (inaudible) of grow really fast, established leadership, winner take all  regardless of profitability.  And it's becoming -- I don't think this -- I  don't think this -- this song ends well.  But the whole point is grow no  matter what the cost.</p><p>KEENE:  And, Francine, what's critical here -- Francine, what's absolutely  critical here is we don't know how this is going to end.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right.  Which was actually my question to Scott, Tom, is that if  you say, you don't think this is going to end well, what do you mean with  that?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, and Priya might have some thoughts on this.  But the end  of the last, you know, the end of the last century, you know, at one point  when the markets seized up, there, you know -- then the tide went out, if  you -- if -- if, you know, if you will, there are a lot of companies caught  very shorthanded.  And you could probably go through 80 percent of the C  startups right now and they're losing money.</p><p>KEENE:  I got eight ways to go here.  Priya, I'm going to -- jump in here.   Is his world like this?  Could he write the book, \"The Four,\" because your  world's given us money for free?  I mean, money for free, right?</p><p>MISRA:  That's the spare point, yes, I think (inaudible) capital is very  low.  But it's -- it's a key point, yes, productivity pick up.  And I think  all this big economy, and people look at what's happening with the four or  five and say, look, productivity is pretty high, there's a lot of  innovation.  So even though the aggregate numbers look low, don't worry,  it's actually going to pick up.  Well, it may not pick up because the  innovation is only happening in these four or five.  On an average, I'm not  sure productivity is picking up.</p><p>KEENE:  Two quick questions, is your world good for her India?  She's one  of the elite of India coming out of their academics.  Is the four and the  five and the six, India is going to be dominant over China in 20 years.  Is  your world good for India?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  What's interesting is if you look at China, the lesson there is  don't let these companies in, steal their IPE and then capture the economic  value yourself, and you hate to say that.  But if you're Italy, do you let  these guys in, let them destroy your media, your -- your ad jobs and let a  lot of shareholder value flow out, or do you adopt the Chinese model of  benchmarking and taking it for yourself?</p><p>KEENE:  Ten second, Yahoo!'s future?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  It's -- it's done.  It's -- it's where it should be, it's been  traded up to a better company and it's going to be, you know, it's going to  be a moment in time and that it's done.</p><p>KEENE:  Scott Galloway, your (inaudible) never going to be winner in New  York.  It's going to be summer forever, \"The Four,\" there it is, Scott  Galloway, New York University.  Priya Misra will continue with us.  Mr.  Galloway has to take Uber downtown to NYU.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  Let's get to our single best chart quickly here.  Priya Misra of TD  Securities, it's the 10-year yield and the great moderation back to 1980.   Over here, the two yellow lines are maybe the land of a view of the end of  the great moderation.  Mr. Gross was here at 2.60 percent as a key  indicator, and he brought that down to a key level of 2.4 percent.  I know  you don't want to parse that narrow, Priya, but the idea of not a lift in  rates but just a chronic steadiness of higher rates is of more interest,  isn't it?</p><p>MISRA:  Yes, definitely.  We're definitely in that (inaudible), that it's - - it's a lower bend, you know, whether it's (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE:  And Bill said that as well.  He didn't predict Walter Heller rates.</p><p>MISRA:  So I think the -- the argument for that is that our star or neutral  rate is actually much lower.  Part of that is inflation, part of that I  would argue is even real rates, neutral real rates are lower globally.   You're looking at a decline in -- in demographics, you're certainly looking  at a decline in productivity that I think is actually far more structured  than this idea that we're just not measuring it right, and I think central  banks have sort of won the war on inflation, and then some, I think that  someone would actually like more inflation than they have.  So if you --  you know, this is a global issue -- yes?</p><p>LACQUA:  So if it's structural, what does that mean?</p><p>MISRA:  It means that, you know, we'll be perpetually waiting for that  productivity lift, so I think central banks will normalize to a point, and  then they'll wait for that productivity lift to actually take the -- the --  the funds rate higher, and that's when they struggle.  So I think globally,  you're seeing this effort towards normalization.  That's why the dollar is  doing what it's doing.  And then I think we're going to be in this band,  and you know, potentially waiting for the next recession.  But you don't  have to have a recession.  You can just sort of be at equilibrium at one  and a half percent real GDP, for example, for the U.S.</p><p>KEENE:  A done deal, is December a done deal or do they move it to  November?  I mean, why not move it to November and get it done with?</p><p>MISRA:  Well, the market is not at all priced for November.  So they have  to tell us today in the minutes that they're very close to November.   You've got a press -- press conference, you've also got the SEP, so once  you get the projections in December and the Fed says, look, we're looking  for inflation to pick up, I think they could justify a hike.</p><p>KEENE:  I'm glad you mentioned that, and we'll look for the minutes this  afternoon, and some value.  Priya Misra with us with TD Securities, thank  you so much.  She'll continue with us with David Gura on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

We got Andrew Sheets on earlier, a little bit more of an equity angle, here with bonds, Priya Misra is with TD Securities and the head of all of their rates strategy, as well.</p><p>Are we in a normal rate environment? The answer is, this has changed, this has changed, this has changed, but your world is still not normal, is it?</p><p>PRIYA MISRA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RATES STRATEGY, TD SECURITIES: I think if you try and decompose interest rates into set of central bank expectations and term premium, we're in a new normal over that term premium is concerned. There's a lot of money chasing yield. And so, you know, treasuries at 2.30 are actually pretty cheap if you compare with bunds or -- or you compare with JGB, so I think that's sort of the new normal we're in. When it's very hard, I think, for bond yields to rise even with central banks normalizing, if you got this very large balance sheet and global rates staying low. So I think that's the new normal here.</p><p>KEENE: OK. Well, Francine just brought this up, let's pull economics into Priya Misra's world. Bring this up in the wall. This -- we can't send this out the way the (inaudible) are set up. This is the Taylor rule that Francine was showing earlier. And here's the soup (ph) down here. These are the equations that Priya memorized in Bangalore when she took her masters. Here is Nehru right here. Now, that's a Ned Phelps kind of economic number there. What is your belief on the system and the idea that rates could nudge up as Bill Gross talks about when you look at the demographic realities of something like Nehru?</p><p>MISRA: I think Nehru is at the (inaudible) in observable quantity. We all tried to estimate it. The Fed, I think, has struggled. The (inaudible) of Nehru significantly.</p><p>KEENE: Does it signal lower interest rates sustained, or is Bill Gross right, the great moderation is ebbing away and we may go with higher rates?</p><p>MISRA: I'm not entirely convinced that -- that it's -- it's sort of ebbing away. And the -- I guess the main reason is that if -- if you look at structural forces, productivity is very low, wage inflation, despite the fact, you were just talking about juries, the labor market is on fire, we still haven't had any wage inflation, really. So, you know, you're not seeing wage inflation, you're seeing PCE actually head lower, we're estimating we'll continuing to head lower over the next six months. So whatever your estimate of Nehru is, you know, it's probably lower than what we've all thought. And that should mean that the neutral rate for The Fed or where the hiking cycle ends is actually much lower than historical.</p><p>So we may see a little bit of ebbing away, I think interest rates can certainly rise, 25-30 basis points, we're not talking a hundred basis points.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Right. But, Priya, once the Fed hikes, is this now, you know, a stronger sustained trend? And are they right to focus on stability? You can argue that actually a lot of the indicators point to stability and they are preferring that to actually looking at that inflation given what you just said about PCE?</p><p>MISRA: Right. That's a fair point. I think we start to struggle with whether that's the reason why the Fed wants to normalize here. There is no reason for the inflation point for them to continue to hike. I think that it's -- it's partly there, but the Fed, I think, at least, under the current leadership does want to focus on sort of macro prudential reasons or -- or -- or tools to actually control financial stability and use monetary policy specifically for the economy, but I think your question becomes very valid once we're at a zero real rate. So once the Fed has normalized, now they've certainly started normalizing the balance sheet, once they think we're at some normal interest rate, not neutral, but normal, I think then the question becomes, what's the catalyst to continue to tighten, you know, maybe financial conditions will -- will become important then. I think that's where Fed leadership becomes significantly important, which we know is -- is entirely influx here.</p><p>LACQUA: So what would be the catalyst to tighten, Priya? And is -- and do -- you know, should they worry about distortion, for example, in the markets?</p><p>MISRA: You know, I think to an extent, they are still normalizing. I still think that they should use macro prudential tools, now, you know, the tool -- the -- the Fed does have the regulatory site. If they ease that significantly, and certainly with -- with Randy Quarles, with, you know -- if we you see significant easing off of financial regulation, I think then the Fed absolutely should take that into account.</p><p>KEENE: Priya Misra with us, and we'll continue this discussion linking in fixed income into the (inaudible), particularly for the markets, and we saw that 22,800 on the Dow yesterday.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Watching on our set, Priya Misra of TD Securities, and within full faith in credit and sovereign debt within the United States, this goes to the opportunity to buy more beleaguered with the stress yield. But I keep hearing this phrase in your literature and others of record tight where the -- the -- the U.S. yield is here or the U.K. yield is here, and things like Catalonia, the yield comes in. Is that still where we are?</p><p>MISRA: I think we are. But when it comes to political risk, I think that's very difficult to price. So I'm not sure you're supposed to be buying Spanish bonds just yet. I mean, the market has corrected significantly, we're not at any wide levels for Spain. I mean, if 1.55 is triggered, I think you get a lot more political risk getting priced in, so (inaudible) can still widen up. I think the question is when the ECB comes in, in two weeks, the entire global rate market is actually watching that. Now, if political risk is at its peak, can, you know, Draghi actually tapers, can we talk about rate hikes here? And that is ...</p><p>KEENE: If the -- if the E.U. steps in, if the ECB steps in, do you get a whole feeling of this, everything moves up?</p><p>MISRA: Yes. I think if they do taper and -- and the question really is not so much the pace of tapering, it's when is the next rate hike. You know, so if they were to taper but they're not hiking until 2019, I think then rates really have a sort of less room to move. But if we're tapering just over the six-month period, I think then bunds came back up and that's taking all treasuries with it, gains with it.</p><p>KEENE: OK. Priya Misra with us on the fixed income market.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: I want to bring in a book right now, and this is classic Scott Galloway. You got the tuition chart here. The professor from NYU Stern with the cost of college chart, and then he comes over here and he observes, I remind myself that NYU are charging kids $500 a minute for me and a projector. This is ridiculous, he says, and actually uses French a little bit skewed towards -- I can't say that on TV. Now, joining us, Scott Galloway of NYU and, of course, the book is \"The Four.\"</p><p>What did you learn in writing the book? A guy as tuned in with you, as wired in as you, when you write about the four big ones, the DNA of Amazon, et cetera, et cetera, what was the observation that surprised you?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: That these countries play by a different set of rules, they're not subject to the same scrutiny, the rest of businesses that we now worship at the altar of innovation versus kindness and character. And there is the way the business is treated and there's the way that innovators and these tech companies are treated.</p><p>KEENE: Will that be snapped at one point? There's a lot of tension here right now between on Washington and the -- the glory boys of Silicon Valley, the glory men and women, I should say, of Silicon Valley. Is there a point where those rules will break?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, I think the warm has turned, Tom, and I think the breaking point was the weaponization by an intelligence unit of the Russian government of some of these platforms, although I think the regulation or the fines aren't going to come from where we think they're going to come from. I think they're going to come out of the E.U., who registers a lot of the downside that appears around the privacy, some of the job destruction, but a fraction of the upside. We register a lot of benefit here in the U.S. but the E.U. doesn't.</p><p>KEENE: You've got great charts in the book that really showed the dominance under some of the metrics here. I love this, follow your talent, not your passion. What is Jeff Bezos' passion?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Total and complete world domination. I think we're headed towards a singularity with Amazon. I think the consumer stocks, the S&amp;P 500, the most dominant factor now is no longer interest rates, no longer even the underlying performance of the consumer company itself, but what Amazon is doing or threatening to do. Kroger lost a third of its value in between the time that Amazon announced the acquisition of Whole Foods and when it closed. Amazon threatens to go into the drug -- drug business, and you have drugstores declined 4-5 percent.</p><p>I think Amazon can outperform Jedi mind tricks, and that is look at a company, just wish ill on it, and begin inflicting pain without even going into that sector.</p><p>LACQUA: Scott, congratulations on the book. I really like Chapter Six. So this Chapter Six is entitled \"Light Me.\" And you say stealing is a core competence of high growth tech firms. This is I.P. but it is also our data.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Yes, well, if -- if -- if you think about what these companies have done and what we're saying to these companies, a fine of a hundred and sixteen million dollars, Facebook says to the E.U. Commission, \"Don't worry about our ability to share data between WhatsApp that we're trying to acquire and the core platforms, as it's impossible.\" The -- the acquisition gets approved by the E.U. and then sub-spoiler alert, they figure it out. And the E.U. fines them a hundred and sixteen million dollars on a $19 billion acquisition. This is the equivalent of a 25-cent parking tick for a hundred dollar an hour meter. We have said to these companies that the smart thing to do for shareholder value is to break the law and to lie to us.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. And -- and that will -- are you suggesting this will actually continue and there's no, you know, there's no way of avoiding this?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, I think you're about to see the mother of all fines come out of Europe. The -- the regulator who I would argue whose testicles have descended as Margrethe Vestager. I think she is the only one that is really going after these companies. I don't think the current administration has the will or the collective I.Q. around technology to take on big tech. I think big tech is smarter, has more resources than -- than -- than Washington is able to compete with. I think the -- the regulation, the intervention of fines are going to come out of the E.U.</p><p>KEENE: Everybody is reading this book, I kid you not. I see it within our -- our studios here in New York, \"The Four\" by Scott Galloway, and it is glorious that the TD Securities, Priya Misra, is reading \"The Four.\" Ask your question of Professor Galloway, Priya, after what you've ground through up through chapter this, chapter that.</p><p>MISRA: Sure. So I'm not a stock analyst, but I think from a macro perspective, the point that you highlight is very valuable. You're getting these monopolies or oligopolies across industries. I think from a macro standpoint, that's keeping inflation pretty low, but my question from 101 Economics is, at some point, they extract monopoly rent. When does that happen? Right now, Whole Foods has -- has sort of kept -- kept inflation low. At what point does Amazon take over the world and then we start seeing higher inflation?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, that's a threat, but to your point, we haven't seen it so far, because anti-trust law is largely based on, if it's good for the consumer, we leave them alone. And it's hard to argue these companies haven't been good for the consumer. But when two thirds of all online growth goes to one player, when the third of all retail growth goes to one player, and a hundred and four percent of all digital marketing growth goes to Facebook and Google, meaning, if you're in digital marketing, you don't work for one of those two companies, you join newspapers and magazines and that your business is in structural decline, one wonders what happens when we wake up and we have four to five companies running the consumer economy.</p><p>KEENE: We're going to micro economics here in honor to Priya Misra, Priya's question is absolutely brilliant. There's a tip point where you flip from the benefits of Amazon over to it being damaging to the greater industry of any given nation. You and I know, you and I know, it's not a tip point, it's not a single point, it's gradual. And I would suggest, Scott, it will be expressed through the labor economy. What do you see now in the labor economy when I get X number of thousand people lined up in Fall River, Massachusetts to fill cardboard boxes?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, these companies -- job destructions through innovation is nothing new. We've just never seen companies this good at it. Amazon needs one person for every two or three that Macy's needs to transact the same amount of business. So the -- just the level of job destruction is incredible. And look at -- look at the icons of yesterday, Tom, General Motors, $50 billion in market cap, a quarter of a million, middle-class households been created, Facebook, $450 billion in market cap, 22,000 jobs. So we're under the impression there's a lot more people working at these companies.</p><p>The total population of these four companies would -- could fit in the Lower East Side, yet it's got the -- the market capitalization, the size of the GDP of India. So if you want to talk about an outsized valuation relative to the number of people, it's staggering. It's great if you own real estate in Portola Valley, it's great of you work for one of these companies. The question is, is it good for the rest of us?</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Scott, the -- the -- you say that basically (inaudible) the European Commission that really wants to go after a lot of these big tech firms in terms of data, but there will be a lot more questions regarding some of the Russia links, as you mentioned briefly, for example, with Facebook. How can the tech firms try to keep Washington at bay?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, I think there's -- I think it depends on the firm. If I were on the board of Amazon, I would prophylactically spend aid (ph) of U.S. I think they should break themselves up first. I think with all -- generally, the key to all crisis management is to be seen as over correcting, so the series of half measures coming out of Facebook saying they would -- they would hire 250 people and then it's gone to a thousand, which I would affectionately referred to as pissing in the ocean. This is a company that could spend a half a billion dollars on A.I. to identify and flag content, hire 10,000 people and it might reduce their cash flow by 10 percent.</p><p>We're talking about not the realm of the possible to stop this but the realm of the profitable. And they're still claiming it would be impossible. Bloomberg wasn't weaponized by Russia, the \"New York Times\" wasn't weaponized by Russia. They can absolutely figure this out. And they need to skip to that right away.</p><p>KEENE: Shout Out to Matt Winkler and John Mickelthwait who helped us not be weaponized by Russia. We're going to continue this conversation with Scott Galloway, let's remember his great work with us, his perspective on Yahoo! and the end of the career for Marissa Mayer. We're going to continue with Priya Misra, TD Securities, with us, Mr. Galloway, the book is \"The Four.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Now, let's get more on the story and the future for Uber with Scott Galloway, he's NYU Stern Marketing professor, he also wrote this great book called \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,\" and also Priya Misra of TD Securities in New York.</p><p>Scott, when you look at Uber, so there's quite a lot of allegations against Uber. What does Uber need to do now to regain public trust, or do they need to regain first of all the trust of regulators?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I think they've taken some key steps, the first is replacing the CEO with someone who's seen as sort of, you know, adult supervision. It feels like the board had two great additions which were put on the board by Travis, John Thain, Ursula Burns, two incredibly seasoned executives, but this was a failure on corporate governance. This was incredibly poor behaviour. It became all about the CEO at a point when the company had a lot of shareholders and families dependent upon the well-being of the company. The board is supposed to be adult supervision and (inaudible) and the board has become until now a place where reputations got to die. So get their corporate governance in order, a better CEO, and I think they've -- I think they've done both of those things.</p><p>KEENE: You talk about Uber as the fifth horseman, maybe the -- the one that comes on with the four, and then you walk beautifully through the history of Uber. Meghnad Desai at LSE would say one question to Scott Galloway, are they profitable or does profit not matter to the four or to the five?</p><p>GALLOWAY: It's a great point, Tom. We've -- Amazon has basically taught the entire ecosystem, that's changed the compact between the market and investors and that it's replaced profits with vision and leadership. And this has snaked all the way back into the private ecosystem. I ran a venture back company. I used to run a venture back company, and the only way I could raise money was if I -- if I promised to lose more money and spend more and grow more.</p><p>KEENE: OK. Is that one-off or is the Amazon model of avoiding operating income margins, et cetera, et cetera, is that replicable over to Uber and to others?</p><p>GALLOWAY: It appears to be the model that Salesforce is chasing, and I would argue the entire private markets are now have adopted this (inaudible) of grow really fast, established leadership, winner take all regardless of profitability. And it's becoming -- I don't think this -- I don't think this -- this song ends well. But the whole point is grow no matter what the cost.</p><p>KEENE: And, Francine, what's critical here -- Francine, what's absolutely critical here is we don't know how this is going to end.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. Which was actually my question to Scott, Tom, is that if you say, you don't think this is going to end well, what do you mean with that?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, and Priya might have some thoughts on this. But the end of the last, you know, the end of the last century, you know, at one point when the markets seized up, there, you know -- then the tide went out, if you -- if -- if, you know, if you will, there are a lot of companies caught very shorthanded. And you could probably go through 80 percent of the C startups right now and they're losing money.</p><p>KEENE: I got eight ways to go here. Priya, I'm going to -- jump in here. Is his world like this? Could he write the book, \"The Four,\" because your world's given us money for free? I mean, money for free, right?</p><p>MISRA: That's the spare point, yes, I think (inaudible) capital is very low. But it's -- it's a key point, yes, productivity pick up. And I think all this big economy, and people look at what's happening with the four or five and say, look, productivity is pretty high, there's a lot of innovation. So even though the aggregate numbers look low, don't worry, it's actually going to pick up. Well, it may not pick up because the innovation is only happening in these four or five. On an average, I'm not sure productivity is picking up.</p><p>KEENE: Two quick questions, is your world good for her India? She's one of the elite of India coming out of their academics. Is the four and the five and the six, India is going to be dominant over China in 20 years. Is your world good for India?</p><p>GALLOWAY: What's interesting is if you look at China, the lesson there is don't let these companies in, steal their IPE and then capture the economic value yourself, and you hate to say that. But if you're Italy, do you let these guys in, let them destroy your media, your -- your ad jobs and let a lot of shareholder value flow out, or do you adopt the Chinese model of benchmarking and taking it for yourself?</p><p>KEENE: Ten second, Yahoo!'s future?</p><p>GALLOWAY: It's -- it's done. It's -- it's where it should be, it's been traded up to a better company and it's going to be, you know, it's going to be a moment in time and that it's done.</p><p>KEENE: Scott Galloway, your (inaudible) never going to be winner in New York. It's going to be summer forever, \"The Four,\" there it is, Scott Galloway, New York University. Priya Misra will continue with us. Mr. Galloway has to take Uber downtown to NYU.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Let's get to our single best chart quickly here. Priya Misra of TD Securities, it's the 10-year yield and the great moderation back to 1980. Over here, the two yellow lines are maybe the land of a view of the end of the great moderation. Mr. Gross was here at 2.60 percent as a key indicator, and he brought that down to a key level of 2.4 percent. I know you don't want to parse that narrow, Priya, but the idea of not a lift in rates but just a chronic steadiness of higher rates is of more interest, isn't it?</p><p>MISRA: Yes, definitely. We're definitely in that (inaudible), that it's - - it's a lower bend, you know, whether it's (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: And Bill said that as well. He didn't predict Walter Heller rates.</p><p>MISRA: So I think the -- the argument for that is that our star or neutral rate is actually much lower. Part of that is inflation, part of that I would argue is even real rates, neutral real rates are lower globally. You're looking at a decline in -- in demographics, you're certainly looking at a decline in productivity that I think is actually far more structured than this idea that we're just not measuring it right, and I think central banks have sort of won the war on inflation, and then some, I think that someone would actually like more inflation than they have. So if you -- you know, this is a global issue -- yes?</p><p>LACQUA: So if it's structural, what does that mean?</p><p>MISRA: It means that, you know, we'll be perpetually waiting for that productivity lift, so I think central banks will normalize to a point, and then they'll wait for that productivity lift to actually take the -- the -- the funds rate higher, and that's when they struggle. So I think globally, you're seeing this effort towards normalization. That's why the dollar is doing what it's doing. And then I think we're going to be in this band, and you know, potentially waiting for the next recession. But you don't have to have a recession. You can just sort of be at equilibrium at one and a half percent real GDP, for example, for the U.S.</p><p>KEENE: A done deal, is December a done deal or do they move it to November? I mean, why not move it to November and get it done with?</p><p>MISRA: Well, the market is not at all priced for November. So they have to tell us today in the minutes that they're very close to November. You've got a press -- press conference, you've also got the SEP, so once you get the projections in December and the Fed says, look, we're looking for inflation to pick up, I think they could justify a hike.</p><p>KEENE: I'm glad you mentioned that, and we'll look for the minutes this afternoon, and some value. Priya Misra with us with TD Securities, thank you so much. She'll continue with us with David Gura on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

We got Andrew Sheets on earlier, a little bit more of an equity angle, here with bonds, Priya Misra is with TD Securities and the head of all of their rates strategy, as well.  </p><p>      Are we in a normal rate environment?  The answer is, this has changed, this has changed, this has changed, but your world is still not normal, is it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  I think if you try and decompose interest rates into set of central bank expectations and term premium, we're in a new normal over that term premium is concerned.  There's a lot of money chasing yield.  And so, you know, treasuries at 2.30 are actually pretty cheap if you compare with bunds or -- or you compare with JGB, so I think that's sort of the new normal we're in.  When it's very hard, I think, for bond yields to rise even with central banks normalizing, if you got this very large balance sheet and global rates staying low.  So I think that's the new normal here.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK.  Well, Francine just brought this up, let's pull economics into Priya Misra's world.  Bring this up in the wall.  This -- we can't send this out the way the (inaudible) are set up.  This is the Taylor rule that Francine was showing earlier.  And here's the soup (ph) down here.  These are the equations that Priya memorized in Bangalore when she took her masters.  Here is Nehru right here.  Now, that's a Ned Phelps kind of economic number there.  What is your belief on the system and the idea that rates could nudge up as Bill Gross talks about when you look at the demographic realities of something like Nehru?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  I think Nehru is at the (inaudible) in observable quantity.  We all tried to estimate it.  The Fed, I think, has struggled.  The (inaudible) of Nehru significantly.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Does it signal lower interest rates sustained, or is Bill Gross right, the great moderation is ebbing away and we may go with higher rates?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  I'm not entirely convinced that -- that it's -- it's sort of ebbing away.  And the -- I guess the main reason is that if -- if you look at structural forces, productivity is very low, wage inflation, despite the fact, you were just talking about juries, the labor market is on fire, we still haven't had any wage inflation, really.  So, you know, you're not seeing wage inflation, you're seeing PCE actually head lower, we're estimating we'll continuing to head lower over the next six months.  So whatever your estimate of Nehru is, you know, it's probably lower than what we've all thought.  And that should mean that the neutral rate for The Fed or where the hiking cycle ends is actually much lower than historical.  </p><p>      So we may see a little bit of ebbing away, I think interest rates can certainly rise, 25-30 basis points, we're not talking a hundred basis points.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right.  But, Priya, once the Fed hikes, is this now, you know, a stronger sustained trend?  And are they right to focus on stability?  You can argue that actually a lot of the indicators point to stability and they are preferring that to actually looking at that inflation given what you just said about PCE?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  Right.  That's a fair point.  I think we start to struggle with whether that's the reason why the Fed wants to normalize here.  There is no reason for the inflation point for them to continue to hike.  I think that it's -- it's partly there, but the Fed, I think, at least, under the current leadership does want to focus on sort of macro prudential reasons or -- or -- or tools to actually control financial stability and use monetary policy specifically for the economy, but I think your question becomes very valid once we're at a zero real rate.  So once the Fed has normalized, now they've certainly started normalizing the balance sheet, once they think we're at some normal interest rate, not neutral, but normal, I think then the question becomes, what's the catalyst to continue to tighten, you know, maybe financial conditions will -- will become important then. I think that's where Fed leadership becomes significantly important, which we know is -- is entirely influx here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  So what would be the catalyst to tighten, Priya?  And is -- and do -- you know, should they worry about distortion, for example, in the markets?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  You know, I think to an extent, they are still normalizing.  I still think that they should use macro prudential tools, now, you know, the tool -- the -- the Fed does have the regulatory site.  If they ease that significantly, and certainly with -- with Randy Quarles, with, you know -- if we you see significant easing off of financial regulation, I think then the Fed absolutely should take that into account.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Priya Misra with us, and we'll continue this discussion linking in fixed income into the (inaudible), particularly for the markets, and we saw that 22,800 on the Dow yesterday.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Watching on our set, Priya Misra of TD Securities, and within full faith in credit and sovereign debt within the United States, this goes to the opportunity to buy more beleaguered with the stress yield.  But I keep hearing this phrase in your literature and others of record tight where the -- the -- the U.S. yield is here or the U.K. yield is here, and things like Catalonia, the yield comes in. Is that still where we are?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  I think we are.  But when it comes to political risk, I think that's very difficult to price.  So I'm not sure you're supposed to be buying Spanish bonds just yet.  I mean, the market has corrected significantly, we're not at any wide levels for Spain.  I mean, if 1.55 is triggered, I think you get a lot more political risk getting priced in, so (inaudible) can still widen up.  I think the question is when the ECB comes in, in two weeks, the entire global rate market is actually watching that.  Now, if political risk is at its peak, can, you know, Draghi actually tapers, can we talk about rate hikes here? And that is ...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  If the -- if the E.U. steps in, if the ECB steps in, do you get a whole feeling of this, everything moves up?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  Yes.  I think if they do taper and -- and the question really is not so much the pace of tapering, it's when is the next rate hike.  You know, so if they were to taper but they're not hiking until 2019, I think then rates really have a sort of less room to move.  But if we're tapering just over the six-month period, I think then bunds came back up and that's taking all treasuries with it, gains with it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK.  Priya Misra with us on the fixed income market.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I want to bring in a book right now, and this is classic Scott Galloway.  You got the tuition chart here.  The professor from NYU Stern with the cost of college chart, and then he comes over here and he observes, I remind myself that NYU are charging kids $500 a minute for me and a projector.  This is ridiculous, he says, and actually uses French a little bit skewed towards -- I can't say that on TV.  Now, joining us, Scott Galloway of NYU and, of course, the book is \"The Four.\"    </p><p>      What did you learn in writing the book?  A guy as tuned in with you, as wired in as you, when you write about the four big ones, the DNA of Amazon, et cetera, et cetera, what was the observation that surprised you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  That these countries play by a different set of rules, they're not subject to the same scrutiny, the rest of businesses that we now worship at the altar of innovation versus kindness and character.  And there is the way the business is treated and there's the way that innovators and these tech companies are treated.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Will that be snapped at one point?  There's a lot of tension here right now between on Washington and the -- the glory boys of Silicon Valley, the glory men and women, I should say, of Silicon Valley.  Is there a point where those rules will break?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Yes, I think the warm has turned, Tom, and I think the breaking point was the weaponization by an intelligence unit of the Russian government of some of these platforms, although I think the regulation or the fines aren't going to come from where we think they're going to come from.  I think they're going to come out of the E.U., who registers a lot of the downside that appears around the privacy, some of the job destruction, but a fraction of the upside. We register a lot of benefit here in the U.S. but the E.U. doesn't.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  You've got great charts in the book that really showed the dominance under some of the metrics here.  I love this, follow your talent, not your passion.  What is Jeff Bezos' passion?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Total and complete world domination.  I think we're headed towards a singularity with Amazon.  I think the consumer stocks, the S&amp;P 500, the most dominant factor now is no longer interest rates, no longer even the underlying performance of the consumer company itself, but what Amazon is doing or threatening to do.  Kroger lost a third of its value in between the time that Amazon announced the acquisition of Whole Foods and when it closed.  Amazon threatens to go into the drug -- drug business, and you have drugstores declined 4-5 percent.    </p><p>      I think Amazon can outperform Jedi mind tricks, and that is look at a company, just wish ill on it, and begin inflicting pain without even going into that sector.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Scott, congratulations on the book.  I really like Chapter Six.  So this Chapter Six is entitled \"Light Me.\"  And you say stealing is a core competence of high growth tech firms.  This is I.P. but it is also our data.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>: Yes, well, if -- if -- if you think about what these companies have done and what we're saying to these companies, a fine of a hundred and sixteen million dollars, Facebook says to the E.U. Commission, \"Don't worry about our ability to share data between WhatsApp that we're trying to acquire and the core platforms, as it's impossible.\"  The -- the acquisition gets approved by the E.U. and then sub-spoiler alert, they figure it out.  And the E.U. fines them a hundred and sixteen million dollars on a $19 billion acquisition. This is the equivalent of a 25-cent parking tick for a hundred dollar an hour meter.  We have said to these companies that the smart thing to do for shareholder value is to break the law and to lie to us.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right.  And -- and that will -- are you suggesting this will actually continue and there's no, you know, there's no way of avoiding this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Well, I think you're about to see the mother of all fines come out of Europe.  The -- the regulator who I would argue whose testicles have descended as Margrethe Vestager.  I think she is the only one that is really going after these companies.  I don't think the current administration has the will or the collective I.Q. around technology to take on big tech.  I think big tech is smarter, has more resources than -- than -- than Washington is able to compete with.  I think the -- the regulation, the intervention of fines are going to come out of the E.U.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Everybody is reading this book, I kid you not.  I see it within our -- our studios here in New York, \"The Four\" by Scott Galloway, and it is glorious that the TD Securities, Priya Misra, is reading \"The Four.\"  Ask your question of Professor Galloway, Priya, after what you've ground through up through chapter this, chapter that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  Sure.  So I'm not a stock analyst, but I think from a macro perspective, the point that you highlight is very valuable. You're getting these monopolies or oligopolies across industries.  I think from a macro standpoint, that's keeping inflation pretty low, but my question from 101 Economics is, at some point, they extract monopoly rent.  When does that happen?  Right now, Whole Foods has -- has sort of kept -- kept inflation low.  At what point does Amazon take over the world and then we start seeing higher inflation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Well, that's a threat, but to your point, we haven't seen it so far, because anti-trust law is largely based on, if it's good for the consumer, we leave them alone.  And it's hard to argue these companies haven't been good for the consumer.  But when two thirds of all online growth goes to one player, when the third of all retail growth goes to one player, and a hundred and four percent of all digital marketing growth goes to Facebook and Google, meaning, if you're in digital marketing, you don't work for one of those two companies, you join newspapers and magazines and that your business is in structural decline, one wonders what happens when we wake up and we have four to five companies running the consumer economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  We're going to micro economics here in honor to Priya Misra, Priya's question is absolutely brilliant.  There's a tip point where you flip from the benefits of Amazon over to it being damaging to the greater industry of any given nation.  You and I know, you and I know, it's not a tip point, it's not a single point, it's gradual. And I would suggest, Scott, it will be expressed through the labor economy.  What do you see now in the labor economy when I get X number of thousand people lined up in Fall River, Massachusetts to fill cardboard boxes?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Well, these companies -- job destructions through innovation is nothing new.  We've just never seen companies this good at it.  Amazon needs one person for every two or three that Macy's needs to transact the same amount of business.  So the -- just the level of job destruction is incredible.  And look at -- look at the icons of yesterday, Tom, General Motors, $50 billion in market cap, a quarter of a million, middle-class households been created, Facebook, $450 billion in market cap, 22,000 jobs.  So we're under the impression there's a lot more people working at these companies.    </p><p>      The total population of these four companies would -- could fit in the Lower East Side, yet it's got the -- the market capitalization, the size of the GDP of India.  So if you want to talk about an outsized valuation relative to the number of people, it's staggering. It's great if you own real estate in Portola Valley, it's great of you work for one of these companies.  The question is, is it good for the rest of us?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right.  Scott, the -- the -- you say that basically (inaudible) the European Commission that really wants to go after a lot of these big tech firms in terms of data, but there will be a lot more questions regarding some of the Russia links, as you mentioned briefly, for example, with Facebook.  How can the tech firms try to keep Washington at bay?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Well, I think there's -- I think it depends on the firm.  If I were on the board of Amazon, I would prophylactically spend aid (ph) of U.S.  I think they should break themselves up first. I think with all -- generally, the key to all crisis management is to be seen as over correcting, so the series of half measures coming out of Facebook saying they would -- they would hire 250 people and then it's gone to a thousand, which I would affectionately referred to as pissing in the ocean.  This is a company that could spend a half a billion dollars on A.I. to identify and flag content, hire 10,000 people and it might reduce their cash flow by 10 percent.  </p><p>      We're talking about not the realm of the possible to stop this but the realm of the profitable.  And they're still claiming it would be impossible.  Bloomberg wasn't weaponized by Russia, the \"New York Times\" wasn't weaponized by Russia.  They can absolutely figure this out.  And they need to skip to that right away.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Shout Out to Matt Winkler and John Mickelthwait who helped us not be weaponized by Russia.  We're going to continue this conversation with Scott Galloway, let's remember his great work with us, his perspective on Yahoo! and the end of the career for Marissa Mayer.  We're going to continue with Priya Misra, TD Securities, with us, Mr. Galloway, the book is \"The Four.\"  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Now, let's get more on the story and the future for Uber with Scott Galloway, he's NYU Stern Marketing professor, he also wrote this great book called \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,\" and also Priya Misra of TD Securities in New York.  </p><p>      Scott, when you look at Uber, so there's quite a lot of allegations against Uber.  What does Uber need to do now to regain public trust, or do they need to regain first of all the trust of regulators?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  I think they've taken some key steps, the first is replacing the CEO with someone who's seen as sort of, you know, adult supervision.  It feels like the board had two great additions which were put on the board by Travis, John Thain, Ursula Burns, two incredibly seasoned executives, but this was a failure on corporate governance.  This was incredibly poor behaviour.  It became all about the CEO at a point when the company had a lot of shareholders and families dependent upon the well-being of the company.  The board is supposed to be adult supervision and (inaudible) and the board has become until now a place where reputations got to die.  So get their corporate governance in order, a better CEO, and I think they've -- I think they've done both of those things.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  You talk about Uber as the fifth horseman, maybe the -- the one that comes on with the four, and then you walk beautifully through the history of Uber.  Meghnad Desai at LSE would say one question to Scott Galloway, are they profitable or does profit not matter to the four or to the five?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  It's a great point, Tom.  We've -- Amazon has basically taught the entire ecosystem, that's changed the compact between the market and investors and that it's replaced profits with vision and leadership.  And this has snaked all the way back into the private ecosystem.  I ran a venture back company.  I used to run a venture back company, and the only way I could raise money was if I -- if I promised to lose more money and spend more and grow more.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK.  Is that one-off or is the Amazon model of avoiding operating income margins, et cetera, et cetera, is that replicable over to Uber and to others?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  It appears to be the model that Salesforce is chasing, and I would argue the entire private markets are now have adopted this (inaudible) of grow really fast, established leadership, winner take all regardless of profitability.  And it's becoming -- I don't think this -- I don't think this -- this song ends well.  But the whole point is grow no matter what the cost.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  And, Francine, what's critical here -- Francine, what's absolutely critical here is we don't know how this is going to end.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Right.  Which was actually my question to Scott, Tom, is that if you say, you don't think this is going to end well, what do you mean with that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  Well, and Priya might have some thoughts on this.  But the end of the last, you know, the end of the last century, you know, at one point when the markets seized up, there, you know -- then the tide went out, if you -- if -- if, you know, if you will, there are a lot of companies caught very shorthanded.  And you could probably go through 80 percent of the C startups right now and they're losing money.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I got eight ways to go here.  Priya, I'm going to -- jump in here.  Is his world like this?  Could he write the book, \"The Four,\" because your world's given us money for free?  I mean, money for free, right?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  That's the spare point, yes, I think (inaudible) capital is very low.  But it's -- it's a key point, yes, productivity pick up. And I think all this big economy, and people look at what's happening with the four or five and say, look, productivity is pretty high, there's a lot of innovation.  So even though the aggregate numbers look low, don't worry, it's actually going to pick up.  Well, it may not pick up because the innovation is only happening in these four or five.  On an average, I'm not sure productivity is picking up.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Two quick questions, is your world good for her India? She's one of the elite of India coming out of their academics.  Is the four and the five and the six, India is going to be dominant over China in 20 years.  Is your world good for India?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  What's interesting is if you look at China, the lesson there is don't let these companies in, steal their IPE and then capture the economic value yourself, and you hate to say that.  But if you're Italy, do you let these guys in, let them destroy your media, your -- your ad jobs and let a lot of shareholder value flow out, or do you adopt the Chinese model of benchmarking and taking it for yourself?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Ten second, Yahoo!'s future?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALLOWAY</emphasis>:  It's -- it's done.  It's -- it's where it should be, it's been traded up to a better company and it's going to be, you know, it's going to be a moment in time and that it's done. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Scott Galloway, your (inaudible) never going to be winner in New York.  It's going to be summer forever, \"The Four,\" there it is, Scott Galloway, New York University.  Priya Misra will continue with us.  Mr. Galloway has to take Uber downtown to NYU.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Let's get to our single best chart quickly here.  Priya Misra of TD Securities, it's the 10-year yield and the great moderation back to 1980.  Over here, the two yellow lines are maybe the land of a view of the end of the great moderation.  Mr. Gross was here at 2.60 percent as a key indicator, and he brought that down to a key level of 2.4 percent.  I know you don't want to parse that narrow, Priya, but the idea of not a lift in rates but just a chronic steadiness of higher rates is of more interest, isn't it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  Yes, definitely.  We're definitely in that (inaudible), that it's -- it's a lower bend, you know, whether it's (inaudible).    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  And Bill said that as well.  He didn't predict Walter Heller rates.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  So I think the -- the argument for that is that our star or neutral rate is actually much lower.  Part of that is inflation, part of that I would argue is even real rates, neutral real rates are lower globally.  You're looking at a decline in -- in demographics, you're certainly looking at a decline in productivity that I think is actually far more structured than this idea that we're just not measuring it right, and I think central banks have sort of won the war on inflation, and then some, I think that someone would actually like more inflation than they have.  So if you -- you know, this is a global issue -- yes?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  So if it's structural, what does that mean?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  It means that, you know, we'll be perpetually waiting for that productivity lift, so I think central banks will normalize to a point, and then they'll wait for that productivity lift to actually take the -- the -- the funds rate higher, and that's when they struggle.  So I think globally, you're seeing this effort towards normalization.  That's why the dollar is doing what it's doing.  And then I think we're going to be in this band, and you know, potentially waiting for the next recession.  But you don't have to have a recession.  You can just sort of be at equilibrium at one and a half percent real GDP, for example, for the U.S.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  A done deal, is December a done deal or do they move it to November?  I mean, why not move it to November and get it done with?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MISRA</emphasis>:  Well, the market is not at all priced for November.  So they have to tell us today in the minutes that they're very close to November.  You've got a press -- press conference, you've also got the SEP, so once you get the projections in December and the Fed says, look, we're looking for inflation to pick up, I think they could justify a hike. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I'm glad you mentioned that, and we'll look for the minutes this afternoon, and some value.  Priya Misra with us with TD Securities, thank you so much.  She'll continue with us with David Gura on Bloomberg Radio.      </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.
