Android creator Andy Rubin was allegedly involved in running a \"sex ring\" with at least one woman, and is accused of cheating his ex-wife out of millions of dollars in their prenuptial agreement, according to a civil complaint unsealed on Tuesday in connection with another case. The documentswere first shared by Buzzfeed News' Ryan Mac[3]. A lawyer for Rubin says that the complaint is full of \"false claims.\" \"This is a family law dispute involving a wife who regrets her decision to execute a prenuptial agreement. It is full of false claims and we look forward to telling our side of the story,\" a lawyer for Rubin told Business Insider.

The details regarding Rubin's alleged extramarital affairs shed new light on last year's New York Times report[5] which claimed the Android creator had been involved in \"ownership relationships\" with multiple women during his marriage. According to the complaint, Rubin would \"pay for their expenses in exchange for offering them to other men.\" Central to the complaint is the accusation that Rubin cheated Rie Rubin, his now-former wife, out of a lot of money by having her sign a prenuptial agreement days before their wedding, while she was pregnant with their child, without adequately disclosing that his lawyer had represented him in a previous divorce. That conflict of interest, as well as the rest of the story, form a basis for invalidating the agreement, Rie Rubin argues in the complaint. With the complaint, Rie Rubin is seeking to invalidate that prenuptial agreement, with which she says that Rubin was able to exclude some of his personal assets from being covered by the agreement \u2014 including what appears to be his portion of the proceeds from the sale of Rubin's previous company Danger to Microsoft in 2008[6].  Specifics of that deal were redacted in the documents. However, the documents say that Rubin's net worth went from about $10.3 million at the time of their marriage, up to an estimated $350 million today. Last fall, when news broke that Google paid Rubin a $90 million exit package despite multiple cases of harassment reportedly having been brought against him, a major controversy was stirred internally at the tech giant. Some 20,000 employees worldwide staged a walkout in protest of Rubin's payout and the company's overall handling of harassment cases, especially amongst executives. At the time, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said[7] that over the previous two years, 48 employees had been fired for sexual misconduct, 13 of whom held senior positions at the company.

In the past few years, Margrethe Vestager, a Danish politician and European Commissioner for Competition, has fined Google and in the process, found how the company is too big and tends to be a data broker. The hyper connected world that we live in is almost impossible to imagine without Google. It provides mail (read: Gmail), mapping solution (read: Google Maps), photo sharing platform (read: Google Photos), and others. </p><p>It is the developer of world's biggest mobile platform (read: Android), and holds the key to the biggest video platform (read: YouTube). If Microsoft[2] was synonymous with the desk, then Google is synonymous with your pocket. Whether you use an Android or an iPhone, there is Google involved in it somehow. Even if you don't use any Google product then some other product could be powered by Google's Cloud service. Despite all the record fines being imposed on it, Google[3] has often challenged those verdicts. The company which has a corporate motto of 'Don't be Evil' sometimes makes you wonder whether it is evil or not. Setting Google's business practices aside for a moment, it needs to be noted that you cannot do a lot of things without giving consent to Google. An easier example is Google Maps, which gives directions from point A to point B by recording your GPS location and it does so, after explicitly taking consent. The unanswered question is whether it stops recording your location after you reached your destination and turned off location services. I'm not trying to justify Google here and in fact, I would want them to be more stringent with the way they handle user data, whether it's on Gmail, Google Maps or Android and this week, we saw some signs of it. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bgr.in/how-to/how-to-install-android-q-developer-beta-on-all-google-pixel-devices-right-now/\">https://www.bgr.in/how-to/how-to-install-android-q-developer-beta-on-all-google-pixel-devices-right-now/</url> Also Read How to install Android Q Developer Beta on all Google Pixel devices right now[4] On Thursday, Google announced the first developer beta of Android Q[5] for its Pixel smartphones. The beta comes even as the company struggles to update the Android distribution numbers for nearly five months now. The beta arrives at a time when most popular smartphones are running at least two generation old version or Android and have little or no opportunity to get the taste of newest flavor of Android. Nevertheless, it shows what Google aims to do with software for the year ahead and most importantly, shows that privacy is an issue it aims to tackle directly. Android Q addresses privacy issues becomes clear by seeing that new iPhone and, where Apple argues that privacy matters. When you install Android Q for the first time on any of the three generations of Pixel smartphones, you will not notice much difference. In fact, the UX is so similar that Google didn't even bother to put an Easter egg. There are signs of Q only at the start screen and in About Phone section. But when you look at Settings menu, there are two profound changes - location and privacy now have dedicated sections. When you tap on them, they are filled with options that are there in current builds of Android Pie. But a leaked build of Android Q[6] hints at a 'Privacy Dashboard' that will let you tackle permission distribution in the form of charts and graphs. Since this is just the first beta and there are reportedly plans for five to six betas before the final release, we could see this feature in future builds.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://st1.bgr.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Android-Q-screen-recording-intext.jpg\">https://st1.bgr.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Android-Q-screen-recording-intext.jpg</url> Image Credit: Rehan Hooda Also, when you open camera app for the first time after installing Android Q beta, you will see a revamped permission setting. Android 9 Pie[7] presented a singular option for location access with options for allow and deny. With Android Q, it changes for good with three different options: Allow, allow only while the app is in use and Deny. The granular option shows how Google will let other apps apart from its own to get user location on Android going forward. In theory, Facebook or Foursquare won't be able to collect your location when you are not using them. It needs to be seen whether that translates into real world use case considering how some apps have been found to use different methods to break the rules. Google has already spoken a great deal about data privacy with Android Q release. One of the leaked AOSP builds showed Google planning to add a real-time notification that would show which apps are using sensitive information such as location. It is not here yet but when it becomes available with future build, Google will only further bridge the gap in privacy practice with iOS, Apple[8]'s mobile operating system. Google is also expected to impose tighter background restrictions, meaning apps will not be able to launch activities in the background. A lot of these measures will not only improve the health of user privacy on Android, but it will also improve battery life.Watch: Android Q How to Install A lot of changes that we are seeing in the very first build of Android Q and the big changes that could arrive in the future build might have to do with the sentiment around the company. Big tech companies, be it Google or Facebook or Amazon, are in the crosshairs of politicians around the world, for their inability to curb misinformation and apparent powers in their respective industry. Some officials even wonder if these companies are monopolies in their individual business domains and lack of competition indicates they are. With Europe passing GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), individuals now have more control over how their data is collected and processed by these tech companies. Data is at the center of everything these tech companies do and access to more data will only make them more powerful as they build Artificial Intelligence[9] into all their services and AI is basically a machine that needs to learn and process data to get better. Privacy is the fundamental right of every person in this world and tech companies should find a way to explicitly get approval before collecting them. The very first build of Android Q shows Google is listening and that is a good start. Actions speak louder than words and, in this case, Google seems to be adopting actions while Menlo Park-headquartered Facebook seems like all words.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://st1.bgr.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Android-Q-screenshot-intext.jpg\">https://st1.bgr.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Android-Q-screenshot-intext.jpg</url> Image Credit: Rehan Hooda Apart from privacy, Google has taken tiny steps to match some seamless features available on iOS. For instance, there is now an option to enable native screen recording from within feature flags in developer options. The Now Playing audio now appears on the always on display while notification shade shows how long the device will last instead of just the battery percentage. One annoying change is when you take screenshot on Android Q, Google takes form of native display, meaning it retains the notch and the screenshots on Pixel 3 XL are downright ugly[10]. I think Google will revert to older screenshot and is probably playing with users. Every change within Android Q seems small but they are significant. They will make the user experience rich, but I fear that all this goodness will be restricted to Google's own Pixel smartphones.

Well, Andy Weissman of Union Square Ventures focuses on early stage investments in the internet, services and information technology sectors. And he is today in the Bloomberg Sooner Than You Think conference at Cornell Tech's new campus on Roosevelt Island. He has been talking about New York City as a technology hub. It has sort of been maybe in the shadow of Silicon Valley to some extent, but certainly has pretty robust presence. Andy, thank you for joining us. Now, when you look at New York and Silicon Valley is sort of opposite poles on the opposite coast here, they do have some similarities, certainly in the terms of costs. So do you find now that New York is not just competing with California but competing with other locations around the country to a larger extent?</p><p>ANDY WEISSMAN, PARTNER, UNION SQUARE VENTURE: Well, I think part of the question is how you define competition and in this case I think each region can be unique, New York is clearly unique, it's different than Silicon Valley. And so I find the competition between New York and Silicon Valley to be a bit of a nothing burger if you will.</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG HOST: Well, framing it from a geographical perspective, obviously, one of the big stories in the economy right now is the extraordinary dominance and influence of the major players in tech, your Amazons, Facebooks, Alphabets, Apples, I think that's them. And the difficulty that people -- that companies are having in competing with them, we have seen how snap, for example, it's kind of withering on the vine against intense competition against Facebook. How do you see that challenger from the perspective of finding early-stage companies?</p><p>WEISSMAN: Well, so this is one of the things I think that's different about the environment we're in right now is that the encumbrance, some of whom you mentioned and others are actually much stronger than they've been. Much stronger, meaning, they're more profitable, they have a lot more cash and then most importantly, I think they're now schooled in the art of disruption, which used to be one of the novel things about the startups we invested in. And so I think as an early-stage investor, you look for characteristics of companies where they won't compete with, you know, the Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, those are harder to find than ever before. It is one of the reasons why this thing called block chain that's so interesting because it's an inverse in a way, it could be real competitive dynamic that's very different. But in the other end, it's definitely more difficult. We've been telling our investors that this is a dynamic that we've seen that may could affect venture returns in general.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Yes. When you think about these companies, they just do all kind of things, from transportation to retail to funding, they're on entertainment. Is Blockchain and Cryptos, is that really the one area that you don't see them dabbling in at all?</p><p>WEISSMAN: Well, I think the thing definitionally, it's very hard for them too because Blockchain as its course and inverse or the way they operate, all those companies are data companies, they collect data and use those data to monetize and create businesses. Blockchain is an open database and so there is no ownership of the data. In fact, by definition, the date is open and anyone can see it. And so if there is a different competitive dynamic, it -- I think it's the idea that companies that make their business around data can compete against a Blockchain at ecosystem where that date is open. There lots of other questions to ask around Blockchain as well, but I think that's the fundamental that has a lot of entrepreneurs and a lot of investors like ourselves excited. There are other areas as well, but that's the one where that competitive dynamic is very, very different.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG HOST: Andy, it's increasing challenge then as you kind of alluded to, actually in terms of when you're looking at a prospect for investment here. The opportunity, the nary in terms of those that don't in any way compete with the increasing size and scale of some of the big tech players, and just having capital now as a venture capitalist kind of built in (INAUDIBLE) you have to offer something different.</p><p>WEISSMAN: Yes, that's been the big change in my experience in the past 10 or 15 years is the capital is no longer scarce, the tension is the scare asset as my partner Albert likes to say. And so my capital is the same color as your capital. And so as VC, I think you have to differentiate around different things. And so for example, we differentiate around having very small funds, we only have one office in New York and we're very thesis-idea driven, hopefully that's enough, but I think you have to differentiate around different access. Access and capital is probably the least relevant one of any. Now this is great for entrepreneurs, amazing, incredible time to be an entrepreneur and you're looking for capital because the number of resources you have has increased dramatically. So it's definitely a harder time for VCs.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Andy, I'm curious about --</p><p>WEISSMAN: Not that I'm asking for your sympathy, but I'm probably --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WEISENTHAL: None given.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: (INAUDIBLE) your own promotion --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WEISENTHAL: None give, but I'm curious --</p><p>WEISSMAN: I will take it if you give me a little, I will talk it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WEISENTHAL: No, that's all right. I'm curious about how your recent --</p><p>WEISSMAN: Yes, I didn't think that.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: -- political situation these days because one of the other interesting things is that tech, I think for the first time and longtime has sort of supplanted that role that perhaps finance had whereas an industry that was really popular to bash. And you see, you know, pundits and politicians on the left and right talk about antitrust, talking about companies squelching free speech, all kinds of reasons to be politically angry at tech companies. How do you think about that and how it affects, you know, sort of the tech landscape from your perspective?</p><p>WEISSMAN: Well, you know, I think it's a really interesting question. In a couple of aspects, one is, i think these tech companies touch more parts of our lives then therefore as they grow and as they become more powerful, they affect people in a way that feels more visceral because they've touched us. How many times have you touched Facebook today? How many times have you touched Google? How many times have I touched Amazon? Quite a few times. Now, does that mean there -- are they anti-competitive? I think that question is much more difficult to answer. But clearly because they touch us in many ways, we feel the competitive situation, I think a little differently and therefore that anger may expressed itself in different ways. I don't know if that anger is actually an expression of bad practices by these companies or something else that's bubbling up in the things that we use every day.</p><p>HYMAN: I'm curious though, Andy, if you do see an actual result of this public anger, if you see increased regulation, if you see antitrust action, et etcetera, how do you feel about that as a VC, as someone who deals with smaller startup players, do think the interests of these tech giants that we're talking about and folks who were in your position, do you think they'd diverge?</p><p>WEISMANN: Well, I mean, we compete against them and so if you believe on a theoretical level that anything that enables our companies to compete better is a good thing, then I guess, yes. The answer is yes. I think it's a little more complicated because I'm not sure again that these companies are anti-competitive in ways that we historically think they are. So how would we do that? We think one thing that's important is that given that these companies are data companies and given that individuals were giving them our data that maybe individuals have a different right to our data than we ever had before. And maybe we should have different rights to take our data with us to be portable with our data, to understand our data, to have computers access our data. My partner Albert likes to call it, the right to be represented by a BOT or an API. I think that's where -- I think solutions maybe find in -- maybe found the things like that that are actually a little more market-based than splitting a company up.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you think actually regulation is a long way off, simply because it's tough to achieve.</p><p>WEISSMAN: You know, I would've said yes, but I pick up the newspaper every day this week and there seems to be some groundswell for it. The issue I have is I don't know -- can we count on the regulators to regulate these companies in a proper way because they look so different? Is Google a search engine or is it a car company? Is Amazon a bookseller or a provider of cloud services? You know, Facebook, what is it, you know. And so because they are different, what would you do? And therefore the chances that you can make a really -- mistake that's really bad for consumers. It feels like that's higher. So it requires I think a different type of thought. And so one exercise is to think about of us consumers, we could take our data that we give to this services and use them in other places, is that a solution? I don't know, but it's an idea that maybe is a little more practical.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Fascinating. Great to chat to you, Andy. Thank you so much. Andy Weissman and their partner at Union Square Ventures.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Well, Andy Weissman of Union  Square Ventures focuses on early stage investments in the internet,  services and information technology sectors.  And he is today in the  Bloomberg Sooner Than You Think conference at Cornell Tech's new campus on  Roosevelt Island.  He has been talking about New York City as a technology  hub.  It has sort of been maybe in the shadow of Silicon Valley to some  extent, but certainly has pretty robust presence.  Andy, thank you for  joining us.  Now, when you look at New York and Silicon Valley is sort of  opposite poles on the opposite coast here, they do have some similarities,  certainly in the terms of costs.  So do you find now that New York is not  just competing with California but competing with other locations around  the country to a larger extent?</p><p> ANDY WEISSMAN, PARTNER, UNION SQUARE VENTURE: Well, I think part of the  question is how you define competition and in this case I think each region  can be unique, New York is clearly unique, it's different than Silicon  Valley.  And so I find the competition between New York and Silicon Valley  to be a bit of a nothing burger if you will.</p><p> JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG HOST: Well, framing it from a geographical  perspective, obviously, one of the big stories in the economy right now is  the extraordinary dominance and influence of the major players in tech,  your Amazons, Facebooks, Alphabets, Apples, I think that's them.  And the  difficulty that people -- that companies are having in competing with them,  we have seen how snap, for example, it's kind of withering on the vine  against intense competition against Facebook.  How do you see that  challenger from the perspective of finding early-stage companies?</p><p> WEISSMAN: Well, so this is one of the things I think that's different about  the environment we're in right now is that the encumbrance, some of whom  you mentioned and others are actually much stronger than they've been.   Much stronger, meaning, they're more profitable, they have a lot more cash  and then most importantly, I think they're now schooled in the art of  disruption, which used to be one of the novel things about the startups we  invested in.  And so I think as an early-stage investor, you look for  characteristics of companies where they won't compete with, you know, the  Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, those are harder to find than ever before.   It is one of the reasons why this thing called block chain that's so  interesting because it's an inverse in a way, it could be real competitive  dynamic that's very different.  But in the other end, it's definitely more  difficult.  We've been telling our investors that this is a dynamic that  we've seen that may could affect venture returns in general.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Yes.  When you think about these companies, they just do all  kind of things, from transportation to retail to funding, they're on  entertainment.  Is Blockchain and Cryptos, is that really the one area that  you don't see them dabbling in at all?</p><p> WEISSMAN: Well, I think the thing definitionally, it's very hard for them  too because Blockchain as its course and inverse or the way they operate,  all those companies are data companies, they collect data and use those  data to monetize and create businesses.  Blockchain is an open database and  so there is no ownership of the data.  In fact, by definition, the date is  open and anyone can see it. And so if there is a different competitive  dynamic, it -- I think it's the idea that companies that make their  business around data can compete against a Blockchain at ecosystem where  that date is open.  There lots of other questions to ask around Blockchain  as well, but I think that's the fundamental that has a lot of entrepreneurs  and a lot of investors like ourselves excited.  There are other areas as  well, but that's the one where that competitive dynamic is very, very  different.</p><p> JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG HOST: Andy, it's increasing challenge then as  you kind of alluded to, actually in terms of when you're looking at a  prospect for investment here.  The opportunity, the nary in terms of those  that don't in any way compete with the increasing size and scale of some of  the big tech players, and just having capital now as a venture capitalist  kind of built in (INAUDIBLE) you have to offer something different.</p><p> WEISSMAN: Yes, that's been the big change in my experience in the past 10  or 15 years is the capital is no longer scarce, the tension is the scare  asset as my partner Albert likes to say.  And so my capital is the same  color as your capital.  And so as VC, I think you have to differentiate  around different things.  And so for example, we differentiate around  having very small funds, we only have one office in New York and we're very  thesis-idea driven, hopefully that's enough, but I think you have to  differentiate around different access.  Access and capital is probably the  least relevant one of any.  Now this is great for entrepreneurs, amazing,  incredible time to be an entrepreneur and you're looking for capital  because the number of resources you have has increased dramatically.  So  it's definitely a harder time for VCs.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: Andy, I'm curious about --</p><p> WEISSMAN: Not that I'm asking for your sympathy, but I'm probably --</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WEISENTHAL: None given.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CHATTERLEY: (INAUDIBLE) your own promotion --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WEISENTHAL: None give, but I'm curious --</p><p> WEISSMAN: I will take it if you give me a little, I will talk it.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WEISENTHAL: No, that's all right.  I'm curious about how your recent --</p><p> WEISSMAN: Yes, I didn't think that.</p><p> WEISENTHAL: -- political situation these days because one of the other  interesting things is that tech, I think for the first time and longtime  has sort of supplanted that role that perhaps finance had whereas an  industry that was really popular to bash.  And you see, you know, pundits  and politicians on the left and right talk about antitrust, talking about  companies squelching free speech, all kinds of reasons to be politically  angry at tech companies.  How do you think about that and how it affects,  you know, sort of the tech landscape from your perspective?</p><p> WEISSMAN: Well, you know, I think it's a really interesting question.  In a  couple of aspects, one is, i think these tech companies touch more parts of  our lives then therefore as they grow and as they become more powerful,  they affect people in a way that feels more visceral because they've  touched us.  How many times have you touched Facebook today?  How many  times have you touched Google?  How many times have I touched Amazon?   Quite a few times.  Now, does that mean there -- are they anti-competitive?   I think that question is much more difficult to answer.  But clearly  because they touch us in many ways, we feel the competitive situation, I  think a little differently and therefore that anger may expressed itself in  different ways.  I don't know if that anger is actually an expression of  bad practices by these companies or something else that's bubbling up in  the things that we use every day.</p><p> HYMAN: I'm curious though, Andy, if you do see an actual result of this  public anger, if you see increased regulation, if you see antitrust action,  et etcetera, how do you feel about that as a VC, as someone who deals with  smaller startup players, do think the interests of these tech giants that  we're talking about and folks who were in your position, do you think  they'd diverge?</p><p> WEISMANN: Well, I mean, we compete against them and so if you believe on a  theoretical level that anything that enables our companies to compete  better is a good thing, then I guess, yes.  The answer is yes.  I think  it's a little more complicated because I'm not sure again that these  companies are anti-competitive in ways that we historically think they are.   So how would we do that?  We think one thing that's important is that given  that these companies are data companies and given that individuals were  giving them our data that maybe individuals have a different right to our  data than we ever had before.  And maybe we should have different rights to  take our data with us to be portable with our data, to understand our data,  to have computers access our data.  My partner Albert likes to call it, the  right to be represented by a BOT or an API.  I think that's where -- I  think solutions maybe find in -- maybe found the things like that that are  actually a little more market-based than splitting a company up.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: So you think actually regulation is a long way off, simply  because it's tough to achieve.</p><p> WEISSMAN: You know, I would've said yes, but I pick up the newspaper every  day this week and there seems to be some groundswell for it.  The issue I  have is I don't know -- can we count on the regulators to regulate these  companies in a proper way because they look so different?  Is Google a  search engine or is it a car company?  Is Amazon a bookseller or a provider  of cloud services?  You know, Facebook, what is it, you know.  And so  because they are different, what would you do?  And therefore the chances  that you can make a really -- mistake that's really bad for consumers.  It  feels like that's higher.  So it requires I think a different type of  thought.  And so one exercise is to think about of us consumers, we could  take our data that we give to this services and use them in other places,  is that a solution?  I don't know, but it's an idea that maybe is a little  more practical.</p><p> CHATTERLEY: Fascinating.  Great to chat to you, Andy.  Thank you so much.   Andy Weissman and their partner at Union Square Ventures.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Well, Andy Weissman of Union Square Ventures focuses on early stage investments in the internet, services and information technology sectors. And he is today in the Bloomberg Sooner Than You Think conference at Cornell Tech's new campus on Roosevelt Island. He has been talking about New York City as a technology hub. It has sort of been maybe in the shadow of Silicon Valley to some extent, but certainly has pretty robust presence. Andy, thank you for joining us. Now, when you look at New York and Silicon Valley is sort of opposite poles on the opposite coast here, they do have some similarities, certainly in the terms of costs. So do you find now that New York is not just competing with California but competing with other locations around the country to a larger extent?</p><p>ANDY WEISSMAN, PARTNER, UNION SQUARE VENTURE: Well, I think part of the question is how you define competition and in this case I think each region can be unique, New York is clearly unique, it's different than Silicon Valley. And so I find the competition between New York and Silicon Valley to be a bit of a nothing burger if you will.</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG HOST: Well, framing it from a geographical perspective, obviously, one of the big stories in the economy right now is the extraordinary dominance and influence of the major players in tech, your Amazons, Facebooks, Alphabets, Apples, I think that's them. And the difficulty that people -- that companies are having in competing with them, we have seen how snap, for example, it's kind of withering on the vine against intense competition against Facebook. How do you see that challenger from the perspective of finding early-stage companies?</p><p>WEISSMAN: Well, so this is one of the things I think that's different about the environment we're in right now is that the encumbrance, some of whom you mentioned and others are actually much stronger than they've been. Much stronger, meaning, they're more profitable, they have a lot more cash and then most importantly, I think they're now schooled in the art of disruption, which used to be one of the novel things about the startups we invested in. And so I think as an early-stage investor, you look for characteristics of companies where they won't compete with, you know, the Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, those are harder to find than ever before. It is one of the reasons why this thing called block chain that's so interesting because it's an inverse in a way, it could be real competitive dynamic that's very different. But in the other end, it's definitely more difficult. We've been telling our investors that this is a dynamic that we've seen that may could affect venture returns in general.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Yes. When you think about these companies, they just do all kind of things, from transportation to retail to funding, they're on entertainment. Is Blockchain and Cryptos, is that really the one area that you don't see them dabbling in at all?</p><p>WEISSMAN: Well, I think the thing definitionally, it's very hard for them too because Blockchain as its course and inverse or the way they operate, all those companies are data companies, they collect data and use those data to monetize and create businesses. Blockchain is an open database and so there is no ownership of the data. In fact, by definition, the date is open and anyone can see it. And so if there is a different competitive dynamic, it -- I think it's the idea that companies that make their business around data can compete against a Blockchain at ecosystem where that date is open. There lots of other questions to ask around Blockchain as well, but I think that's the fundamental that has a lot of entrepreneurs and a lot of investors like ourselves excited. There are other areas as well, but that's the one where that competitive dynamic is very, very different.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG HOST: Andy, it's increasing challenge then as you kind of alluded to, actually in terms of when you're looking at a prospect for investment here. The opportunity, the nary in terms of those that don't in any way compete with the increasing size and scale of some of the big tech players, and just having capital now as a venture capitalist kind of built in (INAUDIBLE) you have to offer something different.</p><p>WEISSMAN: Yes, that's been the big change in my experience in the past 10 or 15 years is the capital is no longer scarce, the tension is the scare asset as my partner Albert likes to say. And so my capital is the same color as your capital. And so as VC, I think you have to differentiate around different things. And so for example, we differentiate around having very small funds, we only have one office in New York and we're very thesis-idea driven, hopefully that's enough, but I think you have to differentiate around different access. Access and capital is probably the least relevant one of any. Now this is great for entrepreneurs, amazing, incredible time to be an entrepreneur and you're looking for capital because the number of resources you have has increased dramatically. So it's definitely a harder time for VCs.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Andy, I'm curious about --</p><p>WEISSMAN: Not that I'm asking for your sympathy, but I'm probably --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WEISENTHAL: None given.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: (INAUDIBLE) your own promotion --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WEISENTHAL: None give, but I'm curious --</p><p>WEISSMAN: I will take it if you give me a little, I will talk it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WEISENTHAL: No, that's all right. I'm curious about how your recent --</p><p>WEISSMAN: Yes, I didn't think that.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: -- political situation these days because one of the other interesting things is that tech, I think for the first time and longtime has sort of supplanted that role that perhaps finance had whereas an industry that was really popular to bash. And you see, you know, pundits and politicians on the left and right talk about antitrust, talking about companies squelching free speech, all kinds of reasons to be politically angry at tech companies. How do you think about that and how it affects, you know, sort of the tech landscape from your perspective?</p><p>WEISSMAN: Well, you know, I think it's a really interesting question. In a couple of aspects, one is, i think these tech companies touch more parts of our lives then therefore as they grow and as they become more powerful, they affect people in a way that feels more visceral because they've touched us. How many times have you touched Facebook today? How many times have you touched Google? How many times have I touched Amazon? Quite a few times. Now, does that mean there -- are they anti-competitive? I think that question is much more difficult to answer. But clearly because they touch us in many ways, we feel the competitive situation, I think a little differently and therefore that anger may expressed itself in different ways. I don't know if that anger is actually an expression of bad practices by these companies or something else that's bubbling up in the things that we use every day.</p><p>HYMAN: I'm curious though, Andy, if you do see an actual result of this public anger, if you see increased regulation, if you see antitrust action, et etcetera, how do you feel about that as a VC, as someone who deals with smaller startup players, do think the interests of these tech giants that we're talking about and folks who were in your position, do you think they'd diverge?</p><p>WEISMANN: Well, I mean, we compete against them and so if you believe on a theoretical level that anything that enables our companies to compete better is a good thing, then I guess, yes. The answer is yes. I think it's a little more complicated because I'm not sure again that these companies are anti-competitive in ways that we historically think they are. So how would we do that? We think one thing that's important is that given that these companies are data companies and given that individuals were giving them our data that maybe individuals have a different right to our data than we ever had before. And maybe we should have different rights to take our data with us to be portable with our data, to understand our data, to have computers access our data. My partner Albert likes to call it, the right to be represented by a BOT or an API. I think that's where -- I think solutions maybe find in -- maybe found the things like that that are actually a little more market-based than splitting a company up.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you think actually regulation is a long way off, simply because it's tough to achieve.</p><p>WEISSMAN: You know, I would've said yes, but I pick up the newspaper every day this week and there seems to be some groundswell for it. The issue I have is I don't know -- can we count on the regulators to regulate these companies in a proper way because they look so different? Is Google a search engine or is it a car company? Is Amazon a bookseller or a provider of cloud services? You know, Facebook, what is it, you know. And so because they are different, what would you do? And therefore the chances that you can make a really -- mistake that's really bad for consumers. It feels like that's higher. So it requires I think a different type of thought. And so one exercise is to think about of us consumers, we could take our data that we give to this services and use them in other places, is that a solution? I don't know, but it's an idea that maybe is a little more practical.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Fascinating. Great to chat to you, Andy. Thank you so much.

Blockchain is an open database and  so there is no ownership of the data.  In fact, by definition, the date is  open and anyone can see it. And so if there is a different competitive  dynamic, it -- I think it's the idea that companies that make their  business around data can compete against a Blockchain at ecosystem where  that date is open.  There lots of other questions to ask around Blockchain  as well, but I think that's the fundamental that has a lot of entrepreneurs  and a lot of investors like ourselves excited.  There are other areas as  well, but that's the one where that competitive dynamic is very, very  different.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, BLOOMBERG HOST: Andy, it's increasing challenge then as  you kind of alluded to, actually in terms of when you're looking at a  prospect for investment here.  The opportunity, the nary in terms of those  that don't in any way compete with the increasing size and scale of some of  the big tech players, and just having capital now as a venture capitalist  kind of built in (INAUDIBLE) you have to offer something different.</p><p>WEISSMAN: Yes, that's been the big change in my experience in the past 10  or 15 years is the capital is no longer scarce, the tension is the scare  asset as my partner Albert likes to say.  And so my capital is the same  color as your capital.  And so as VC, I think you have to differentiate  around different things.  And so for example, we differentiate around  having very small funds, we only have one office in New York and we're very  thesis-idea driven, hopefully that's enough, but I think you have to  differentiate around different access.  Access and capital is probably the  least relevant one of any.  Now this is great for entrepreneurs, amazing,  incredible time to be an entrepreneur and you're looking for capital  because the number of resources you have has increased dramatically.  So  it's definitely a harder time for VCs.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Andy, I'm curious about --</p><p>WEISSMAN: Not that I'm asking for your sympathy, but I'm probably --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WEISENTHAL: None given.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: (INAUDIBLE) your own promotion --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WEISENTHAL: None give, but I'm curious --</p><p>WEISSMAN: I will take it if you give me a little, I will talk it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WEISENTHAL: No, that's all right.  I'm curious about how your recent --</p><p>WEISSMAN: Yes, I didn't think that.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: -- political situation these days because one of the other  interesting things is that tech, I think for the first time and longtime  has sort of supplanted that role that perhaps finance had whereas an  industry that was really popular to bash.  And you see, you know, pundits  and politicians on the left and right talk about antitrust, talking about  companies squelching free speech, all kinds of reasons to be politically  angry at tech companies.  How do you think about that and how it affects,  you know, sort of the tech landscape from your perspective?</p><p>WEISSMAN: Well, you know, I think it's a really interesting question.  In a  couple of aspects, one is, i think these tech companies touch more parts of  our lives then therefore as they grow and as they become more powerful,  they affect people in a way that feels more visceral because they've  touched us.  How many times have you touched Facebook today?  How many  times have you touched Google?  How many times have I touched Amazon?   Quite a few times.  Now, does that mean there -- are they anti-competitive?   I think that question is much more difficult to answer.  But clearly  because they touch us in many ways, we feel the competitive situation, I  think a little differently and therefore that anger may expressed itself in  different ways.  I don't know if that anger is actually an expression of  bad practices by these companies or something else that's bubbling up in  the things that we use every day.</p><p>HYMAN: I'm curious though, Andy, if you do see an actual result of this  public anger, if you see increased regulation, if you see antitrust action,  et etcetera, how do you feel about that as a VC, as someone who deals with  smaller startup players, do think the interests of these tech giants that  we're talking about and folks who were in your position, do you think  they'd diverge?</p><p>WEISMANN: Well, I mean, we compete against them and so if you believe on a  theoretical level that anything that enables our companies to compete  better is a good thing, then I guess, yes.  The answer is yes.  I think  it's a little more complicated because I'm not sure again that these  companies are anti-competitive in ways that we historically think they are.   So how would we do that?  We think one thing that's important is that given  that these companies are data companies and given that individuals were  giving them our data that maybe individuals have a different right to our  data than we ever had before.  And maybe we should have different rights to  take our data with us to be portable with our data, to understand our data,  to have computers access our data.  My partner Albert likes to call it, the  right to be represented by a BOT or an API.  I think that's where -- I  think solutions maybe find in -- maybe found the things like that that are  actually a little more market-based than splitting a company up.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you think actually regulation is a long way off, simply  because it's tough to achieve.</p><p>WEISSMAN: You know, I would've said yes, but I pick up the newspaper every  day this week and there seems to be some groundswell for it.  The issue I  have is I don't know -- can we count on the regulators to regulate these  companies in a proper way because they look so different?  Is Google a  search engine or is it a car company?  Is Amazon a bookseller or a provider  of cloud services?  You know, Facebook, what is it, you know.  And so  because they are different, what would you do?  And therefore the chances  that you can make a really -- mistake that's really bad for consumers.  It  feels like that's higher.  So it requires I think a different type of  thought.  And so one exercise is to think about of us consumers, we could  take our data that we give to this services and use them in other places,  is that a solution?  I don't know, but it's an idea that maybe is a little  more practical.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Fascinating.  Great to chat to you, Andy.  Thank you so much.   Andy Weissman and their partner at Union Square Ventures.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Well, Andy Weissman of Union Square Ventures focuses on early stage investments in the internet, services and information technology sectors.  And he is today in the Bloomberg Sooner Than You Think conference at Cornell Tech's new campus on Roosevelt Island.  He has been talking about New York City as a technology hub.  It has sort of been maybe in the shadow of Silicon Valley to some extent, but certainly has pretty robust presence. Andy, thank you for joining us.  Now, when you look at New York and Silicon Valley is sort of opposite poles on the opposite coast here, they do have some similarities, certainly in the terms of costs.  So do you find now that New York is not just competing with California but competing with other locations around the country to a larger extent?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISSMAN</emphasis>: Well, I think part of the question is how you define competition and in this case I think each region can be unique, New York is clearly unique, it's different than Silicon Valley.  And so I find the competition between New York and Silicon Valley to be a bit of a nothing burger if you will.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Well, framing it from a geographical perspective, obviously, one of the big stories in the economy right now is the extraordinary dominance and influence of the major players in tech, your Amazons, Facebooks, Alphabets, Apples, I think that's them.  And the difficulty that people -- that companies are having in competing with them, we have seen how snap, for example, it's kind of withering on the vine against intense competition against Facebook.  How do you see that challenger from the perspective of finding early-stage companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISSMAN</emphasis>: Well, so this is one of the things I think that's different about the environment we're in right now is that the encumbrance, some of whom you mentioned and others are actually much stronger than they've been.  Much stronger, meaning, they're more profitable, they have a lot more cash and then most importantly, I think they're now schooled in the art of disruption, which used to be one of the novel things about the startups we invested in.  And so I think as an early-stage investor, you look for characteristics of companies where they won't compete with, you know, the Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, those are harder to find than ever before.  It is one of the reasons why this thing called block chain that's so interesting because it's an inverse in a way, it could be real competitive dynamic that's very different.  But in the other end, it's definitely more difficult.  We've been telling our investors that this is a dynamic that we've seen that may could affect venture returns in general.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Yes.  When you think about these companies, they just do all kind of things, from transportation to retail to funding, they're on entertainment.  Is Blockchain and Cryptos, is that really the one area that you don't see them dabbling in at all?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISSMAN</emphasis>: Well, I think the thing definitionally, it's very hard for them too because Blockchain as its course and inverse or the way they operate, all those companies are data companies, they collect data and use those data to monetize and create businesses.  Blockchain is an open database and so there is no ownership of the data.  In fact, by definition, the date is open and anyone can see it. And so if there is a different competitive dynamic, it -- I think it's the idea that companies that make their business around data can compete against a Blockchain at ecosystem where that date is open.  There lots of other questions to ask around Blockchain as well, but I think that's the fundamental that has a lot of entrepreneurs and a lot of investors like ourselves excited.  There are other areas as well, but that's the one where that competitive dynamic is very, very different.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Andy, it's increasing challenge then as you kind of alluded to, actually in terms of when you're looking at a prospect for investment here.  The opportunity, the nary in terms of those that don't in any way compete with the increasing size and scale of some of the big tech players, and just having capital now as a venture capitalist kind of built in (INAUDIBLE) you have to offer something different.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISSMAN</emphasis>: Yes, that's been the big change in my experience in the past 10 or 15 years is the capital is no longer scarce, the tension is the scare asset as my partner Albert likes to say.  And so my capital is the same color as your capital.  And so as VC, I think you have to differentiate around different things.  And so for example, we differentiate around having very small funds, we only have one office in New York and we're very thesis-idea driven, hopefully that's enough, but I think you have to differentiate around different access. Access and capital is probably the least relevant one of any.  Now this is great for entrepreneurs, amazing, incredible time to be an entrepreneur and you're looking for capital because the number of resources you have has increased dramatically.  So it's definitely a harder time for VCs.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: Andy, I'm curious about --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISSMAN</emphasis>: Not that I'm asking for your sympathy, but I'm probably --  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: None given.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: (INAUDIBLE) your own promotion --   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: None give, but I'm curious --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISSMAN</emphasis>: I will take it if you give me a little, I will talk it.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: No, that's all right.  I'm curious about how your recent --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISSMAN</emphasis>: Yes, I didn't think that. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>: -- political situation these days because one of the other interesting things is that tech, I think for the first time and longtime has sort of supplanted that role that perhaps finance had whereas an industry that was really popular to bash.  And you see, you know, pundits and politicians on the left and right talk about antitrust, talking about companies squelching free speech, all kinds of reasons to be politically angry at tech companies.  How do you think about that and how it affects, you know, sort of the tech landscape from your perspective?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISSMAN</emphasis>: Well, you know, I think it's a really interesting question.  In a couple of aspects, one is, i think these tech companies touch more parts of our lives then therefore as they grow and as they become more powerful, they affect people in a way that feels more visceral because they've touched us.  How many times have you touched Facebook today?  How many times have you touched Google? How many times have I touched Amazon?  Quite a few times.  Now, does that mean there -- are they anti-competitive?  I think that question is much more difficult to answer.  But clearly because they touch us in many ways, we feel the competitive situation, I think a little differently and therefore that anger may expressed itself in different ways.  I don't know if that anger is actually an expression of bad practices by these companies or something else that's bubbling up in the things that we use every day.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HYMAN</emphasis>: I'm curious though, Andy, if you do see an actual result of this public anger, if you see increased regulation, if you see antitrust action, et etcetera, how do you feel about that as a VC, as someone who deals with smaller startup players, do think the interests of these tech giants that we're talking about and folks who were in your position, do you think they'd diverge?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISMANN</emphasis>: Well, I mean, we compete against them and so if you believe on a theoretical level that anything that enables our companies to compete better is a good thing, then I guess, yes.  The answer is yes.  I think it's a little more complicated because I'm not sure again that these companies are anti-competitive in ways that we historically think they are.  So how would we do that?  We think one thing that's important is that given that these companies are data companies and given that individuals were giving them our data that maybe individuals have a different right to our data than we ever had before.  And maybe we should have different rights to take our data with us to be portable with our data, to understand our data, to have computers access our data.  My partner Albert likes to call it, the right to be represented by a BOT or an API.  I think that's where -- I think solutions maybe find in -- maybe found the things like that that are actually a little more market-based than splitting a company up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: So you think actually regulation is a long way off, simply because it's tough to achieve.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISSMAN</emphasis>: You know, I would've said yes, but I pick up the newspaper every day this week and there seems to be some groundswell for it.  The issue I have is I don't know -- can we count on the regulators to regulate these companies in a proper way because they look so different?  Is Google a search engine or is it a car company? Is Amazon a bookseller or a provider of cloud services?  You know, Facebook, what is it, you know.  And so because they are different, what would you do?  And therefore the chances that you can make a really -- mistake that's really bad for consumers.  It feels like that's higher.  So it requires I think a different type of thought. And so one exercise is to think about of us consumers, we could take our data that we give to this services and use them in other places, is that a solution?  I don't know, but it's an idea that maybe is a little more practical.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>: Fascinating.  Great to chat to you, Andy.  Thank you so much.

Advocates hope the complaints will shed light on the opaque ways that personal data is traded through third parties online both in the EU and the US.The General Data Protection Regulation is a sweeping personal data privacy law[1] that came into force in late May in the EU. For the rest of the world, it's viewed as a bellwether for whether Big Tech can be held in check when immense data leaks seem to happen with painful regularity[2].Formal complaints to European regulators under the GDPR by UK non-profit Privacy International were also filed[3] against ad-tech companies Criteo, Quantcast and Tapad as well as credit agencies Equifax (the subject of a massive breach just last year) and Experian.\"Our complaints target companies that, despite exploiting the data of millions of people, are not household names and therefore rarely have their practices challenged,\" said Ailidh Callander, legal officer at Privacy International, in an email to Engadget. </p><p>\"These companies' business models are premised on data exploitation.\"Data brokers aggregate personal information from other sources -- for instance, websites you've visited or credit card records -- to create a complex profile on who they think you are[4]. That profile may include political leanings and income, and subsequently get sold to brands or social networks. Acxiom claims[5] to have data on about 700 million people globally. Consumers often don't hand data directly to these companies via their own websites -- the way one would with, say, Facebook -- which allows the data trading to operate in relative obscurity.This alleged lack of consent is precisely what Privacy International is targeting. The non-profit also claims that these companies lack \"legitimate interest\" (in legal terms) for processing the personal data, which may infer political, ethnic and religious affiliations. The companies fail to comply, according to Privacy International, with the principles of \"transparency, fairness, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy and confidentiality and integrity\" -- in other words, nearly all of the new privacy law's core foundations[6].\"The law has changed and these companies need to as well,\" said Callander. \"There is a gap between how [the] GDPR conceptualises data privacy and [how] these companies do and the onus is on them (if necessary, pushed by regulators) to close it.\"In public statements, Experian has said[7]: \"We have worked hard to ensure that we are compliant with GDPR and we continue to believe that our services meet its requirements.\" Criteo has stated[8]: \"We have complete confidence in our privacy practices.\"Companies are still feeling out just how the law is going to be enforced, which is why test cases like this bear watching. Facebook and Google are among the other companies who have faced complaints[9] so far. A spokesman from the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, where many American tech firms keep European headquarters, said the regulators have already received 2,500 breach notifications and 1,200 complaints related to the GDPR since May.

As I have <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/4284812/donald-trumps-confidence-game-h/\"> pointed out before</url>, one of the most diabolically effective traits of our president is his ability to embed a single truth in a welter of lies.</p><p>His remarks last week at the Economic Club of New York were case in point. I wasn\u2019t there, but I saw from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-economic-club-new-york-new-york-ny/\"> transcript</url> that his take on his own economic record got a lot more applause than I would have expected. That may be because the stock market has remained, against many predictions (including my own) at record highs, and the ECNY crowd is full of investors. </p><p>But the president twisted a few things in regards to the reasons for that boom, and the ramifications of it. The Fed, as usual, got the sharp end of the stick for its \u201cnear record number of rate increase and quantitative tightening.\u201d In fact, I think that one key reason the markets are where they are at the moment is that the Fed has now moved on to openly monetising the US deficit, something that will probably result in currency depreciation (I think my own short term predictions will fare better there). </p><p>Already people such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-04-03/stanley-druckenmiller-most-unsustainable-situation-i-have-seen-ever-my-career\"> Stan Druckenmiller</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dimon-us-has-serious-issues-2016-4\"> Jamie Dimon</url> are warning about the longer-term impact of America\u2019s debt driven economy. But I worry about the short-term impact \u2014 if the markets stay up through 2020, that means we may get Trump 2. </p><p>The Fed, meanwhile, is looking hopelessly politicised, albeit not in the way you might think. Central bankers aren\u2019t doing Trump\u2019s bidding. But once the saccharine impact of the Trump tax cuts wore off, it became clear that unless the Fed started expanding its balance sheet again, the whole financialised card game that is the US economy at the moment would collapse. No matter what the long-term cost \u2014 the US dollar losing ground as a reserve currency, America looking like Venezuela \u2014 they feel morally bound to not let things fall apart on their watch. As Liaquat Ahmed explained in his book, \u201cLords of Finance,\u201d it has always been thus.</p><p>But back to Trump\u2019s speech: another truthful-seeming lie worth calling out is the president\u2019s assertion that \u201cblue-collar jobs are leading the way in the boom\u201d, including mining, energy, manufacturing and construction positions. </p><p>The first point is, in fact, true. Gigs at $15 an hour are the fastest growing job categories in the US. But the jobs are in retail and low end services, not mines or factories. </p><p>That matters bigly. The program on the Law and Regulation of Financial Institutions and Markets at Cornell has come up with a new metric for gauging that economic transition to low end service jobs \u2014 the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prosperousamerica.org/press_release_cpa_partners_on_release_of_national_jobs_quality_index\"> Cornell-CPA</url> US Private Sector Job Quality Index, which launched last week, found that at the beginning of the 1990s, a little more than half of all private sector jobs studied were below the median weekly wage. Today, it\u2019s 63 per cent. So, while we have \u201crecord low unemployment\u201d, as the president likes to remind us, it doesn\u2019t matter so much, because the work isn\u2019t high quality enough to generate real Main Street growth.</p><p>In short \u2014 we\u2019ve got quantity but not quality. Which is true about so many things these days, from the economy, to the president\u2019s own Tweets.</p><p>Ed, do you have a favourite truthful lie from the president?</p><p>Recommended Reading</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Fareed Zakaria\u2019s story of how he won, and then lost, the Zelensky interview and what it tells us about impeachment and Ukraine is worth a read in The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\"> Washington Post.</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>I also did my own Post column this week, for book promo, looking at how <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/13/will-be-litmus-test-capitalism/\"> Elizabeth Warren v.

They are obviously front and centre at the moment because of our president. But I\u2019ll be checking out their own fascinating and more heartening stories in these podcasts.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Edward Luce responds</p><p>Rana, That\u2019s a difficult question as Donald Trump has told quite a few truthful lies. His harassment of Fed chairman Jay Powell is a good example. Were it any other president, or had Trump been doing so in conventional rather than mobster terms (\u201cWho is our greater enemy? Fed chairman Powell, or Chinese president Xi?\u201d), a lot more people would be agreeing with him. US monetary policy has been too tight for too long \u2014 and probably remains so. </p><p>Another example is his attack on Hunter Biden\u2019s \u201ccorruption\u201d. Again, were it not for the fact that Biden\u2019s actions were a) legal and b) barely a molehill to the Trump family\u2019s Mount Everest of self-dealing, we might be agreeing with him. Washington was a swamp of what I call \u201csoft nepotism\u201d long before Trump arrived. But Trump, of course, makes everything dramatically worse. </p><p>Churchill once said that the truth is so precious it must be attended by a body of lies. With Trump, the big lie is so vital to him that it must be disguised with the occasional scrap of truth.</p><p>Your feedback</p><p>We\u2019d love to hear from you.

Will it come to pass? Calls to break up the big tech companies[1] may be overdone depending on which side of the regulatory and political aisle you are on. </p><p>But a loosening of the grip by Google and Facebook on the global advertising market will prove to be a good thing for a burgeoning ad tech industry. Any time a monopoly or, in this case, duopoly is unchallenged for too long it harms innovation[2]. That's certainly become true of ad tech of late. Google announced earnings at the end of April and, as expected, we saw its advertising businesses increasingly pressured[3] by newcomers like Amazon - sending the Alphabet stock down 15 per cent, its worst day decline in nearly seven years. To be clear, I'm a fan of Google and Facebook. They've done amazing things for global advertising, connecting billions of consumers seamlessly to brands and marketers. But that has sometimes come at the expense of opportunities for smaller ad tech providers and would-be innovators. The first signs of trouble for the duopoly became apparent during the previous earnings season in February, when Amazon reported that it earned more than $10 billion in 2018 income - most of which came from its advertising business. That raised eyebrows. Indeed, Amazon's e-commerce platform, which has a natural ability to gather consumer data, gives it an edge over Facebook. Google is more diversified with its search business and its Android mobile operating system, which powers most of the world's smartphones. But traffic acquisition costs for Google have been very obviously rising as a percentage of revenue. Competition is forcing both Facebook and Google's costs up in the advertising space. With Amazon as the new competitor, we will move into a healthier state of affairs with a little bit more room for smaller ad tech players to steal slices of the giants' pie. I'm a strong believe that ad tech start-ups and innovators have an important role to play in the future of advertising, with a few big challenges on the immediate horizon that they can help solve. One big challenge is around how to reduce ad loads on consumers, by which I mean how advertising evolves to continue delivering margins and profits while reducing the disruption caused to consumers. This tends to happen when ads are not delivered seamlessly in a way that flows with the content experience they are consuming, be it on a browser, TV, tablet, or mobile. For example, rather than interrupting a consumer watching a TV show with a regular advert, a mixed reality experience prompt could be offered that invites them to learn more about a product they just saw on their favourite TV show. It could be Tesla's latest electric car or Samsung's new folding smartphone. The technology already exists for the mixed-reality prompt to be delivered to the consumer's tablet or smartphone, though the content was being watched on their TV.

This kind of offline-to-online tracking technology already exists, but challenges remain around how to implement it in a way that is not creepy. Ads need to become more relevant and targeted, but there is also a deeper question about the need for advertising to be reinvented altogether. If there is to be a rebirth of the industry - revolution rather than evolution - ad tech players are going to play a key role in how that's conceptualised, achieved, and delivered. With a more competitive advertising industry, the guys at the top (Amazon, Google, and Facebook) will be forced to innovate more quickly and aggressively in terms of what they offer the buy and sell sides. This will mean many more ad tech acquisitions and greater market incentives for breakthrough technology to be built, bought, and sold. I'm optimistic about the end of the Google-Facebook duolopoly in advertising and so should you be - especially if you're one of the little guys. It will prove to be a big boon for ad tech.

He was visiting the Nashville location, and as it happened, the Music City outpost was slammed. The manager pulled up Whitney's information in the corporate system  \u2014 checked out, looked good \u2014 and told him to get out on the floor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> He went home with $140 that day. Soon he was splitting his time between Nashville's Rio Bravo and Le Peep, where his attitude impressed the well-heeled Belle Meade clientele. \"You seem like a smart guy,\" Whitney remembers a customer saying to him. \"Why are you waiting tables?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"See that over there?\" he replied, pointing to a book about the Web language HTML. \"I'm studying to become a programmer.\"</p><p> As fate would have it, the customer's last name was Frist.</p><p> Whitney started attending user group meetings, networking, and sharpening his programming skills. Eventually following a lead from one of his best tables, he applied for a job as a developer at HealthStream \u2014 a company run by Bobby Frist. He got the job in April 2001, a day after his son was born.</p><p> He worked there for a year \u2014 it was \"a confusing time in the company,\" Whitney says \u2014 before leaving for an agency called Anode where he would meet formative challenges.</p><p> \"The guy I replaced, I think, literally would choose another technology set for every single project,\" Whitney remembers. \"So I walked in and inherited ColdFusion technology, this weird database called 4th Dimension, Microsoft ASP, PHP, Java \u2014 like, if there was a technology you could build a Web app on, he had done it. The server room had Windows, and it also had Linux, and it had \u2014 I mean, it was unbelievably exotic. ...</p><p> \"I spent a lot of late nights when everyone else was gone, with the lights dim, trying to read all these books and understand all this technology that I did not understand. But I ended up learning it.\"</p><p> Flash forward to Oct. 23, 2012, a gala event at the downtown Schermerhorn Symphony Center. The occasion is the Nashville Technology Awards, and one of the night's biggest honors is Chief Technology Officer of the Year. Standing at the podium, facing the concert hall's grand tiers and sonically exacting fixtures, is this year's winner, Marcus Whitney. Within months, he'll have an even bigger prize \u2014 $5 million in Series B financing for his Nashville-based company, Moontoast.</p><p> As remarkable as Whitney's rise, though, is the number of peers now present to applaud him. Among the night's other winners will be Kate O'Neill. Her company [meta]marketer works with clients ranging from the Grand Ole Opry to Ingram Book Co. to optimize the way customers interact with their websites. Even the dazzling 20-foot video display that frames Whitney was created just blocks away, near the Entrepreneur Center on Broadway, in the offices of LMG Design Studio. Months before, LMG's Ken Gay had worked there perfecting Madonna's Super Bowl halftime show.</p><p> There too is Clint Smith, CEO of online email marketing company Emma. Maybe the most dramatic local tech success of recent years, Emma has gone national, with satellite offices in Portland, Ore., Denver, Austin and New York City. And yet Smith describes being at a neighborhood supper party a few years ago and having to explain what he does for a living.</p><p> \"Oh, you mean like a Constant Contact or an Emma?\" his neighbor asked \u2014 assuming Smith's office must be some lesser local version.</p><p> \"It's funny,\" Smith says, \"the assumption that [we] were in San Francisco or somewhere like that.\"</p><p> But he's not. He's in Nashville, where a close-knit \u2014 some might say incestuous \u2014 community of local tech pioneers has risen through the ranks. A new generation of small, nimble companies is bubbling up across the city, staffed by skeleton crews of obsessive coders and CEOs crazy enough to believe they can build the next big thing. They talk in a patois of acronymic geek-speak, venture capitalist jargon and affirmational sloganeering. The names may be unfamiliar to many Nashvillians \u2014 Cardagin, Evermind, Kiwi, Waffle, Zeumo \u2014 but their ethos is not.</p><p> They believe Nashville has what it takes to be a great technology city \u2014 and moreover, it's a point of pride. Scroll to the bottom of Populr.me, and you'll find a tagline more likely to be inlaid on a guitar or stitched on a bespoke tie than displayed on a website specializing in HTML5-based micropublishing: \"Proudly made in Nashville, TennesseeUSA.\" And as more break through to a national stage, they want to see others join them, and extend what they've done.</p><p> For that to happen, though, the city will have to figure out how to keep and attract tech talents who, at the moment, are more eagerly courted (and more richly compensated) in established development hubs. And as Nashville shows an aggressive new focus on tech cultivation and recruitment, its tech community must decide whether it's worth trading some of the city's sense of mutual supportiveness for a sharper competitive edge.</p><p> The rise of Moontoast says much about the tortuous development of Nashville's tech culture. In the early Aughts, once he'd signed on with Anode, Whitney found himself on a small team that was basically a startup operating within the company. They developed a digital signage platform called FireSign, and made their first installation at the Frist Center.</p><p> click to enlarge</p><p> * Photo: Eric England</p><p> * Marcus Whitney</p><p> \"I didn't realize it, but it really kind of determined what my professional path was going to be,\" Whitney says, \"into products and startup.\" After leaving Anode to start what he calls an \"ill-fated\" consulting firm, Whitney landed as one of the first employees at Emma. The company, whose name is a portmanteau of \"email\" and \"marketing,\" had been successfully launched by dot-com-crash survivors Clint Smith and Will Weaver, and it was ready to grow.</p><p> \"But the platform they had was built by an intern at Vanderbilt,\" Whitney says, \"who, the legend says, they paid in beer.\" After Whitney helped completely rewrite Emma's system, Smith and Weaver offered better than a few cases of Natty Light: They made him a partner. He went on to help hire out the remaining technical team, and stayed on for three years.</p><p> Then came the tweets heard 'round the world.</p><p> Whitney was at South by Southwest in 2007 when Twitter debuted. \"It was unbelievable,\" he says. \"It was the first time that I got to experience mobile devices literally determining where dollars were going to go locally.\" That got him thinking in new ways.</p><p> \"I believed that social was going to change the way that marketers worked completely,\" Whitney says. At the time, though, Emma was not in a position to capitalize. \"The right thing for them to do was to solidify the business,\" he explains, and they did \u2014 only without their new partner. Over a tumultuous 60-day period in 2007, Whitney left Emma, which was now serving 10,000 clients; started his own technology company, Remarkable Wit; and separated from his wife.</p><p> \"A very, very intense period in my life,\" he deadpans.</p><p> As Remarkable Wit was developing its client base, Whitney met two key figures, Joe Glaser and Bucky Baxter. Though known mostly for music \u2014 Glaser for his world-class guitar shop, Baxter as a first-call pedal steel player and former Bob Dylan sideman \u2014 they had an idea for a company that aligned exactly with Whitney's innovation thesis, which was: Social media would continue to grow; e-commerce would continue to grow; online marketing would continue to grow; and \"somewhere in there, in that intersection, there was a great technology opportunity.\"</p><p> Glaser and Baxter collected angel funding, and Whitney began operating what was basically a startup within his own startup. In March 2009, Baxter and Whitney launched Moontoast at South by Southwest, the event that had, in a sense, inspired its invention. By summer 2010, the company would have $6 million in Series A financing secured.</p><p> What Moontoast does for a client roster that includes Big Machine Records and Lexus is create direct-to-consumer campaigns and in-newsfeed apps. That second part seems obvious enough \u2014 everything, including email signups and purchases, happens seamlessly inside the Facebook newsfeed, without requiring consumers to jump to an external site.</p><p> \"It's very 'duh,' \" Whitney says, \"but still nobody's doing it but us.\" In fact, the \"duh\" aspect is the secret to a killer app, and the hardest to accomplish. The goal is something easy to use that masks its true complexity, thus making it difficult to copy or steal.</p><p> Later in 2010, Moontoast would open an office in Boston, with Whitney spending an average of 175 days a year traveling back and forth. The expansion led to speculation that Whitney was moving the company, a rumor he has worked hard to dispel.</p><p> \"I've always been working for Nashville,\" he says adamantly. He has never forgotten that he landed a job his first day here, or that user groups at Cummins Station helped him learn and grow.</p><p> \"I have a debt of gratitude to this city,\" he says. \"My life is here. I moved my parents here. I've got two children here. I've got a fianc)e here. My best friends are here.</p><p> \"The other thing,\" he adds, \"is that in order for me to have a great professional career, Nashville has to evolve as a startup city.\"</p><p> In a city notoriously resistant to change, that will be no small feat. But at least Whitney and his fellow Music City tech pioneers know what obstacles they face \u2014 and maybe how to overcome them.</p><p> By the time he sold it in 2007, Mark Montgomery's Echo Music had offices in Nashville, London, New York and Los Angeles, with clients ranging from Kanye West to Keith Urban. But in the Aughts, when he was pitching the monied classes of Nashville his fairly novel idea \u2014 targeted online music sales \u2014 he got mostly cold stares, or blank ones. He laughs remembering one incredulous response from a potential investor: \"You wanna sell what on the where?\"</p><p> click to enlarge</p><p> * Photo: Eric England</p><p> * Mark Montgomery</p><p> To be sure, Nashville has come a long way since Montgomery started selling \"what\" on the \"where\" more than a decade ago. Even so, three key problems persist in the wider startup ecosystem.</p><p> First, there is not enough technical talent in Nashville, especially at the senior level \u2014 the level of experience needed to produce the simplicity Marcus Whitney cites as the grail.</p><p> \"So you're better off trying to do something that's pretty damn difficult to pull off, but you make it feel simple,\" Whitney explains. \"Well, guess what? That doesn't require junior and midlevel developers. That requires software architects and great, experienced engineers who've been there and done that and been through fires.\"</p><p> The Nashville Technology Council publishes a quarterly Tech Jobs Report, which typically lists anywhere from 800 to 1,200 unfilled positions in Middle Tennessee. \"It's huge, and it's a challenge right now,\" says Liza Massey, the council's president and CEO. \"What we have got to get really good at now is not just creating our own tech graduates and employees, but bringing them in.\"</p><p> Montgomery is more blunt: \"I think we lack the technical co-founder and pure tech talent to really bring the market into a sort of nationally competitive realm.\" And as Nashville's profile has risen, senior talent has been recruited away.</p><p> \"Corey Watson, who used to be head engineer at Magazines.com, works for Twitter,\" Whitney says. \"Rick Bradley, he works for GitHub. ... I know that Facebook has approached developers in this market.\"</p><p> Second, not enough investment capital is going to small, risk-taking startups in Nashville.</p><p> \"The deals are way better than they were, but they're still not there,\" Montgomery says. Part of that has to do with an old-money mindset. At meetings for Partnership 2010 \u2014 the Chamber of Commerce's economic development initiative, now Partnership 2020 \u2014 Montgomery says he told the \"85 old white guys in suits\" this: \"Look, Nashville doesn't fund what it doesn't understand, and all it understands is health care services. And if you really want to be a national player, you've really got to start thinking outside of what your comfort zone is.\"</p><p> There's a reason that comfort zone is the shape and size it is. Landon Gibbs of the venture capital firm Clayton Associates explains it simply: \"Historically, Nashville has been a health care community \u2014 people have seen a lot of success.\" And investors are in the business of succeeding. Part of the hesitance has to do with the kind of in-between area tech startups represent. Venture capitalists typically don't want to invest below $1 million because the math doesn't make sense for them: It's too much risk for too little reward.</p><p> Third, Nashville isn't generating enough big ideas.</p><p> Relative to other markets, Montgomery writes in a recent Tumblr post, Nashville is still producing \"C-plus/B-minus ideas.\" And as the story of Clint Smith's neighbor demonstrates, even the really good, really successful ideas that originate here don't necessarily get associated with Nashville.</p><p> Whitney acknowledges all these challenges. But he says quality of ideas is not his biggest concern.</p><p> \"The ecosystem is more important than the idea,\" he says. \"When you launch a venture, you're starting with 5 percent true, true awareness of the reality of what this business could be, and 95 percent is uncertain. And over time, as you go to market, and you create, and you get the proprietary knowledge from sales interactions, you close in on something close to, I would say, 80 percent, at a max. ... In a strong ecosystem, you close that gap faster. You can adjust, and you're not so dependent on the strength of that initial idea.\"</p><p> Michael Burcham, president and CEO of the Entrepreneur Center, phrases it more tersely: \"Good ideas are worth about 20 bucks. It's all about execution.\" Taken together, the obstacles are daunting, Montgomery believes, but not insurmountable.</p><p> \"I think those things are all being worked on,\" he says, \"and quite frankly, I think we're on year three of a 20-year continuum.\"</p><p> Or is that year six? Many, like Kate O'Neill, believe the spark really ignited over the course of 12 hours in August 2007, when Nashville's isolated tech community first saw the strength of its numbers. The setting was a crowded, bustling, \"miserably hot\" Exit/In; the occasion, the very first BarCamp Nashville.</p><p> click to enlarge</p><p> * Photo: Eric England</p><p> * Kate O\u2019Neill</p><p> The BarCamp concept of bringing tech-minded people together for an \"unconference\" was born in the Bay Area. While the first Nashville iteration didn't follow the rules exactly \u2014 against form, the event featured scheduled speakers, including serial entrepreneur and Brazen Careerist founder Penelope Trunk \u2014 it laid an important section of the tech scene foundation.</p><p> \"The whole idea was to bring the community together,\" says Dave Delaney, a social media marketer who helped organize the first BarCamp Nashville along with Whitney (his recruiter to work at Emma) and O'Neill. \"Many of them met for the first time in person.\"</p><p> That physical connection proved crucial. In that pre-Facebook, pre-LinkedIn version of Nashville, the bloggers, coders, entrepreneurs and marketers in attendance mostly knew each other only digitally through a network of blogs. Many were aggregated by the WKRN-hosted hub Nashville Is Talking, spearheaded by Brittney Gilbert and later run by Christian Grantham, who now works in the aboveground moonshine business. But meeting in person, at BarCamp Nashville, brought needed new levels of networking.</p><p> \"That was a pretty key moment,\" O'Neill says. \"It was such a great connecting point for the Web and digital thinkers in town who didn't have a physical venue.\" At the time, she worked as a Web developer at Magazines.com, sharpening the analytics skills she would use to start her own company, [meta]marketer. (O'Neill took the award for Social Media Strategist of the Year at the 2012 Nashville Technology Awards Gala.)</p><p> \"Within a few years,\" O'Neill says, \"there's a slew of geek-related opportunities \u2014 Firefly Logic Geek Social, the Nashville Geek Calendar.\" Add to that mix Podcamp (a content-side version of the BarCamp concept) and well-attended meet-ups around Ruby on Rails and other programming languages, and serious momentum began to build.</p><p> Opportunities for meat-space networking spread. Delaney's Geek Breakfast template \u2014 coffee and computers, basically \u2014 has been exported as far away as London and Johannesburg, and he continues to host the events in Nashville monthly. That a schism would develop, albeit briefly, in 2010 between social media- and marketing-focused BarCampers and those more interested in hard coding only showed how much the community had grown.</p><p> But if any company proved what benefit real-life social networking could bring to the city's nascent tech scene, it was CentreSource. An early (and ongoing) BarCamp sponsor, CentreSource helped modernize Nashville's technology infrastructure and vocabulary.</p><p> As founder Nicholas Holland puts it, \"The open-source movement had not found a home yet in Nashville; on the flipside, it was roaring in tech centers like Silicon Valley, New York, Boston, Austin. We had early on decided to use the open-source stack.\" CentreSource was one of the first companies in Nashville to provide digital strategy for companies that, in many cases, didn't think they needed it.</p><p> \"Our competitors laughed and said no one would pay for strategy,\" Holland recalls. \"I don't know a single firm in town that doesn't charge for strategy now.\"</p><p> In 2010, .net magazine named CentreSource one of the top three design agencies in the world at a London ceremony. Here, it is just as well known for hosting Yazoo-fueled monthly events that draw upwards of 250 tech-minded Nashvillians \u2014 a forum where peers can blow off steam and toss around ideas. Yet even when beer isn't flowing, CentreSource has served as an important connecting point, thanks to Holland's allowing anyone to rent a desk in the company's collaborative workspace.</p><p> When relocated New Yorker Brian Daily, Jason Moore and former Nashville Technology Council president Tod Fetherling all started working on separate projects at the CentreSource offices, something interesting happened: They got to talking and realized their interests overlapped in important ways. With CentreSource as essentially their creative lab, they decided to start a company together. Stratasan, a cloud-based health care analytics company, launched in September 2010.</p><p> But if BarCamp provided what O'Neill calls a \"gelling of sorts,\" the gel only spread so far. For Nashville's tech scene to take off, it needed more institutional backbone. That need ushered in the next major development on the city's tech front.</p><p> Just as Montgomery had found himself frustrated with the investment community, Holland encountered a similar disconnect at the enterprise business level. He remembers going to a Nashville Technology Council board meeting and asking how many were going to BarCamp. \"Crickets,\" he says. \"They had zero idea about this occurring right under their nose. And it highlights the maturity process that Nashville has had to go through to understand this kind of entrepreneurial stuff.\"</p><p> Around 2008, when Holland was developing one of the first location-based iPhone games \u2014 GPS Assassins, which eventually sold to Seattle-based WorldBlender with around 24,000 active players \u2014 he pitched Vic Gatto of the venture capital firm Solidus Co. on the idea of investing. That's when Holland learned about the $1 million threshold for traditional venture capitalists. (Full disclosure: Solidus is an investor in SouthComm, parent company of the Nashville Scene, and Gatto serves on its board of directors.)</p><p> Gatto knew Solidus couldn't get in the tech startup game playing by the old rulebook. But he was also sympathetic to the plight of Holland and other tech startup founders. \"Vic was really the only VC that was going to BarCamp, showing up on panels and like, really starting to venture out into the space and connect the dots with us,\" Whitney says.</p><p> So Gatto led the way in establishing a microfund called JumpStart Foundry, which launched in March 2010 to help back new technology-based companies early in their development.</p><p> \"It was such a ragtag group of people \u2014 ridiculously wealthy guys next to guys with three failed startups,\" Holland says. \"We had no idea what we were doing.\" But for taking that chance with JumpStart, Holland calls Gatto \"one of the unsung heroes of Nashville.\"</p><p> JumpStart Foundry was built on a fairly simple, if unconventional, premise: A group of companies still in concept (or \"seed\") stage would pitch their ideas to the Foundry members. Then they'd leave the team while the Foundry debated.</p><p> \"We'd argue, and we'd yell, and somebody would have to say, 'I'm going to be the champion for X company,' \" Whitney explains. \"And then they'd walk back into the room and we'd say, 'OK, here's $15,000, here's your team from the Foundry, go make something great.\"</p><p> JumpStart was testing uncharted waters \u2014 uncharted in Nashville, at least. (It was modeled partly on programs like TechStars, started in Boulder, Colo., and Y Combinator, started in Silicon Valley.) \"None of the state regulators understood it,\" Holland says. \"Hell, half the startups in town were suspicious of it.\" But it was mixing things up, and the tech-funding gears, frozen for so long, slowly began to turn.</p><p> Meanwhile, a new venue and connecting point was finally taking shape. In August, the Entrepreneur Center, a project more than three years in the making, opened its doors on Lower Broad.</p><p> \"I don't think the public really saw it happening, but if you were in the know, it was really starting to come together,\" Whitney says. If 2007 was pivotal for the grassroots Nashville tech community, 2010 marked a similar turning point for the city's larger tech-hub aspirations.</p><p> \"You're starting to realize who has money, and you're starting to see angel deals getting done,\" Whitney says. \"And you're starting to kind of understand what this EC thing was really going to be about.\"</p><p> Sitting above street level at 105 Broadway, next door to Joey and Gavin DeGraw's bar/nightclub The National Underground, the Entrepreneur Center doesn't look like much from the outside. But every day, people are fighting for their professional lives inside.</p><p> President and CEO Michael Burcham is happy to rattle off the vital stats: more than 5,000 visitors in its first 24 months; 1,500 business concepts screened; 50 companies incubated and launched through the EC; total seed and angel money raised by EC startups approaching $20 million. He delivered these to a meeting of StartupAmerica leaders in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 5, where he says the name Nashville was on everyone's lips. (Perhaps Burcham couldn't help but \"break into the goofy grin of the newly popular,\" as The New York Times put \"it.\")</p><p> Of the 50 businesses that have come through the EC, \"well over half of them have already reached a break-even point and are now self-sustaining,\" Burcham reports. Jamplify, a social media platform that rewards users with tickets or other merchandise for creating buzz around bands, took home top honors at Midem, one of the world's largest music industry conferences, after going through JumpStart last summer.</p><p> Later this year, the Entrepreneur Center will reopen in Rolling Mill Hill, where it will join Emma, Hands On Nashville and the Center for Nonprofit Management. The new EC will be three times the size of the Lower Broad location, and include dedicated space for corporate employees to work away from their offices on new ideas.</p><p> \"There's a lot of cross-pollination we'll be doing on that hill,\" Burcham says, \"and our goal is to make Rolling Mill Hill, when we all get there together, sort of the creative campus of Nashville.\"</p><p> If there is broad agreement about the three main obstacles facing the tech community, there has certainly been internal disagreement about how best to address them. Montgomery says the Nashville Chamber of Commerce approached him looking for a recommendation on the workforce front. \"So we put together a pretty substantial thought process for them,\" he says with a shrug, \"and they're building a fucking website.\"</p><p> That website, WorkITNashville.com, launched officially on Feb. 5 with an event at the Frist, and packages Nashville as a vibrant hub bubbling over with music, arts, great neighborhoods and, most importantly, good tech jobs. Smith, Whitney and O'Neill are among the smiling faces beckoning prospective tech workers to town, along with a searchable database of open jobs.</p><p> Thinking he could help \"home-grow some talent,\" John Wark, a longtime programmer and part-time Belmont instructor, took matters into his own hands: He founded the Nashville Software School in January 2012 after talking with local entrepreneurs about the talent shortage. He runs an intensive vocational program specifically tailored to the specific needs of Nashville tech companies.</p><p> \"John's a doer,\" Montgomery says. \"Everyone else sat around and whined about it, and he figured it out.\"</p><p> The NSS focuses on practical skills. \"We're training people to get entry-level software developer or Web developer jobs,\" he says. \"There are no gen-ed requirements. We're teaching people how to program.\"</p><p> The first class started in June and consisted of 15 people. Most had never done any programming or even taken a Web design class. Several were musicians. Of the 14 students who graduated in November, however, eight had full-time jobs before Christmas. Two more have landed positions since the New Year, and all the remaining graduates are either doing contract work or actively interviewing.</p><p> A point of pride for Wark is that the NSS is, as far as he knows, the only program of its kind in the country operated as a nonprofit. That helps keep the cost relatively low for students. Partnering with local companies also helps offset those costs, though Holland says he'd like to \"cast a cone of shame on the large companies\" for not taking the lead.</p><p> On the financial side, JumpStart has helped, as has a similar microfund called Bullpen Ventures, which Holland used to incubate his new business, Populr \u2014 a platform that allows users to create drag-and-drop single-page websites called POPs, short for \"Published One-Pagers.\"</p><p> Wark admits the NSS is only \"one piece of the solution.\" Even if they bear a decent number of successes, a few well-run microfunds can only close the gap so much. But Burcham says there's another force that's already applying noticeable pressure on local investors: outside investors. He cites Jamplify as an example of a Nashville startup that quickly drew interest in New York \u2014 which in turn sparked interest in Nashville.</p><p> \"And while it takes a little time,\" Burcham says, \"nothing begins to move a market [like] seeing this sort of traction of things coming in and out of the market \u2014 other eyes looking in, saying 'We want that.' \"</p><p> That's a lesson Mike Butera is learning, as he introduces a product that's already turning heads across the country.</p><p> click to enlarge</p><p> * Photo: Michael W. Bunch</p><p> * Mike Butera and the Artiphon Instrument 1</p><p> \"So this is made in Nashville,\" Butera says, running his hands along the sleek mahogany-stained body of the Artiphon Instrument 1. \"The wood's cut right across the river. Cumberland Architectural Millwork is one of our partners and investors. And it's all designed here, by people who've worked for and designed some of the top audio consoles and consumer electronics.\"</p><p> The Instrument 1 is about the size of a ukulele, but instead of a sound hole it has a dock for an iPhone 5. Instead of strings, it has two touch- and velocity-sensitive pads: a narrow one for strumming, finger-picking or bowing; the other, about the width of a fretboard, for forming chords or playing individual notes on raised ridges that mimic strings but don't move.</p><p> The iPhone provides the sound processing, through two speakers that can handle up to 30 watts, but not the playing surface. A player can hold it like a guitar or under the chin like a violin, and through an almost endless variety of apps can make it sound like anything from an acoustic guitar to a squelchy, arpeggiated synthesizer. As evidenced by numerous videos posted to sites like TechCrunch \u2014 which brought Butera onstage during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas \u2014 the Instrument 1 largely elicits wide-eyed, slack-jawed delight. A gaggle of Scene staffers reacted much the same way, giggling in amazement.</p><p> Butera says he continues to be amazed by the response wherever he shows off the Instrument 1, which will sell for $800 and precede a less expensive consumer-grade version. Artiphon attracted so much attention at CES that the annual National Association of Music Merchants invited them to its Los Angeles trade show.</p><p> \"We think that you're ahead of the curve,\" Butera says NAMM organizers told him, \"and it's likely that you are pushing us out into a new category that in the next couple years is gonna be so obvious.\"</p><p> Still, despite all the glowing press, Butera says, \"it has been really difficult to figure out where to go for money in town. And part of that is, we have certain values about how we want to do it. We want to maintain ... our principles of environmental sustainability, domestic production, things like that.\" He likens Artiphon's position to that of local clothiers like Imogene + Willie or Otis James \u2014 companies whose signature is handcrafted quality, and who must reconcile rising demand with their principles.</p><p> \"We have the same struggle,\" Butera says. \"We can make these by hand. They're very expensive. ... If we could make it in Nashville, and it [only] cost $5 more, would we do it? Yes. But is anyone stepping up to provide those services to us? Would the investors support that? Do people care about that enough? It's just an ongoing question.\"</p><p> Pre-orders for the Instrument 1 begin later this quarter, and while bringing the project to life has brought its share of frustrations, Butera remains committed to Nashville even with the lure of outside money.</p><p> \"I have not yet gone to Silicon Valley with this for a reason,\" he says. \"I think it's better done here.\"</p><p> Here is the last American city dedicated to music, trying to become the next American city dedicated to technology. An unlikely progression? Perhaps not.</p><p> \"Musicians and coders are the same animal.\" Mark Montgomery says. \"When you look at it, they're both math equations. They have a very similar mind. And they have very similar quirks. Coders are wacky as hell, right? Musicians are wacky as hell.\"</p><p> If not wackiness, then maybe it's some combination of creativity, attention to detail and mastery of patterns that draws similar minds to music and programming. Which makes sense. After all, \"three chords and the truth\" just might be the purest line of code ever written in Nashville.</p><p> Singer-songwriter Matt Urmy started his own tech startup after becoming frustrated with the many apps he was using to manage his music career. The all-in-one solution he helped develop, Artist Growth, just launched its second version, which includes a deeper set of tools for management companies to also access and organize data for their artists \u2014 including booking dates, merchandise sales and inventory, even live performance royalties that can be reported as soon as the band walks offstage.</p><p> \"On the creative side in software design, it's very much like writing a song,\" Urmy says. \"After days and weeks and months of struggling with a line of code ... [getting the finished product ready is] like the final days of mastering.\" And there's another important similarity he sees: \"a strong sense of the tech community supporting and helping people to really grow this sector of Nashville.\"</p><p> Kate O'Neill agrees. \"My late husband and I were songwriters together,\" she says. \"I do feel like the songwriting and music community has played a massively significant role \u2014 the style of interaction, the collaboration tendencies within it. I don't think it's one to be downplayed.\"</p><p> \"It's a total parallel,\" Butera says. \"And the Nashville music industry was put on the map because people started to realize they could get a lot more done through those network effects, rather than just the lone songwriter.\"</p><p> \"I've worked in the Bay Area, Portland, Chicago ... but it has not felt like a truly supportive networked community like it does here,\" O'Neill says. \"It's noticeable in the songwriting community here, and it has carried over \u2014 the collaborative songwriting culture here. Inevitably what happens is we tell our respective stories, but the upshot always seems to be, 'How can we work together?' \"</p><p> In April 2012, Bridgette Sexton opened a post on the official Google blog with this observation: \"Nashville and Silicon Valley have a lot in common. They're both filled with smart, creative people building businesses together. Nashville's start-up scene may be less well known, but it's bursting with energy and creativity like the rest of the city.\" Sexton had just been here for a Google for Entrepreneurs event at aVenue that sold out in four minutes.</p><p> It's a sign, among many, that the momentum felt in the startup scene is real. Nashvillians who once were surprised to read Alex Ross columns about their hometown orchestra in The New Yorker can now read about Nashville startups in TechCrunch, Venture Beat and Forbes. Recently, Apple featured the real-time multi-angle video-compiling app Streamweaver, designed and based in Nashville, at the top of iTunes' App Store.</p><p> The wins are starting to pile up, too. \"Rivals[.com] sold for $100 million to Yahoo,\" Montgomery says. \"My company sold for 25. StudioNow for 37.5. You know, every time that happens, the boats go up a little bit.\" In January, Moontoast secured $5 million in Series B funding. That same month, Streamweaver raised $1.3 million in Series A funding, which was led by former Facebook privacy officer Chris Kelly. Franklin-based recipe app Just a Pinch recently raised more than $1.5 million. Populr has already raised $475,000.</p><p> \"As investors are getting more comfortable and seeing that risk profile getting lowered,\" says Clayton Associates' Gibbs, \"you're going to see more dollars flowing into the technology community.\"</p><p> \"We have to not get complacent and not start patting ourselves on the back,\" Montgomery says. \"Fuck that. Now is the time to push the pedal to the metal.\"</p><p> Whitney's optimism is similarly cautious. \"We all know each other, we know each other's families \u2014 it's a cool, cool community,\" he says. \"I'll tell you what the con is: We're not aware of how competitive, how aggressive these other markets are. And so we don't really execute, generally speaking, with the same type of precision and aggression. We're a little more relaxed. There are benefits to that! But I think sometimes we're just not really aware of what it takes to compete at that level. And that's a little concerning.\"</p><p> O'Neill doesn't quite see it that way. \"As much as there may be more maturity and sophistication in other markets,\" she says, \"the greatest advantage we have here is connectedness.\"</p><p> That connectedness, along with a lot of hard work, has 2013 primed to be a big year for tech in Nashville. Where that could lead is anyone's guess.

He got a lot right - predicting Hampstead Heath would be transformed into \"a people's park\" and that there would be a fight to clean the air. He guessed that in the city of the future people would wear \"neither hats nor bonnets\" and that \"innumerable electric wires\" would make communication easy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One error stands out. He was sure that London's streets would flow freely in the shiny tomorrow's world of far-off 1957: full of electric trams, special lanes for lorries and a separate \"convenient and spacious drive\" for carriages. He would have been shocked by the gridlock and danger we put up with instead today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's play the game now. What will London's roads be like in 10 or 100 years? It's a good moment to ask because right now a rich industry is springing up based upon a revolution in travel that those involved in are betting on heavily. Venture capital investors are pouring money into tech start-ups they think have the answer. The age of the private car in cities, they claim, is almost over. We need to get ready for a new generation.</p><p>So if you drive in London, pay attention, because if these futurists are right, the city of today will soon seem as old-fashioned as those black-andwhite pictures of a city full of horse and carts.</p><p>The transformation is starting now, with a push to get polluting diesel vehicles off our streets. The Department for Transport is conducting its biggest review in a generation and has said this could lead to electric scooters being allowed on UK roads for the first time. Next month the Ultra Low Emission Zone comes into effect in central London, and from 2021 it's meant to cover all of the capital inside the North and South Circular Roads. You'll still be able to drive if your car meets the new standards or you pay a \u00a312.50 daily fee - but it could be just the start of something much more radical.</p><p>The next step, set out in the Mayor's transport strategy, is to make central London a zero-emissions area by 2025 and London a zero-carbon city by 2050 - with none of today's polluting vehicles. \"We'll only bring it in when vehicle technology is available,\" promises Paul Cowperthwaite, who is in charge of road charging at Transport for London. But the race is on to find the things which will make it possible.</p><p>Will they be self-driving robot pods, picking us up at the click of a button? Or zippy electric scooters? Will more people cycle with e-bikes? And will there still be cars, even if they are electric ones? Or maybe the move to homeworking means we won't be moving about as much at all? The first step will be the phasing out of petrol and diesel cars. In 10 years, predicts Steve Gooding at the RAC Foundation, charging electric cars won't be the \"nightmare\" it is in London today. \"Almost every lamppost could have a trickle charge capacity,\" he says - park and plug in.</p><p>After that he imagines \"driverless buses which have conductors\" coming to the city of the future, though he's not alone in wondering if self-driving socalled autonomous cars, now being backed by big tech firms, might struggle to cope with London's narrow, twisty streets. If cars keep stopping every time a pedestrian walks out in front of them, it might take them \"a couple of days to get across Covent Garden\".</p><p>Part of the problem, says Isabel Dedring, global transport leader at engineers Arup, and previously London's deputy mayor for transport, is that too much excitement is coming from \"zillions of technology ideas\" from companies. They are \"seeking to reinvent how we move in cities, promising things that are about to be here like flying cars\" - but they should be thinking instead about the problems these gadgets are supposed to solve. You could dream up a way to deliver fruit to people in offices by drone, she says - \"but no one is going to want drones everywhere in the air\".</p><p>So what's actually going to be useful in the future? According to Azmat Yusuf, the founder of the company launching Citymapper Pass, a joined-up way to allow Londoners to pay for all sorts of transport services from bikes to the Tube and shared taxis in one bill, \"we are seeing huge progress on electric transport\" but \"autonomy is going to be harder to predict, especially in complex cities like London\".</p><p>He sees potential in one technology a lot of people are chasing this year, what's called \"micromobility\". Things such as powered scooters, \"which seemed toys even two years ago\", are catching on in other cities though in London their use is banned. \"If it's not scooters,\" he says, \"it might be a different kind of device more suited for London\".</p><p>The aim is to solve what transport planners call \"the last mile\" - which right now is one of the big reasons people decide to drive rather than use public transport. There might be a quick train for most of the journey but if it is a mile and a bit walk to the station at each end, and it's raining, the car seems easier even if it is slower and polluting.</p><p>Find a clever way to get you to the station, though, and suddenly cars aren't needed. It might be electric taxis offering shared rides, it might be light electric bikes you can pick up at docking stations or it might be scooters - or, of course, something else that might make its inventors rich.</p><p>E-scooters, though, do have a problem: \"Some do 40mph,\" says Dedring. \"On sidewalks that's not a good idea\" - and does anyone want to ride on a flimsy board on rough roads mixed up with lorries and buses? That's one reason London's transport bosses have held back from allowing them - although plenty are already being used anyway. Other cities aren't so cautious: Madrid has just given permits to more than a dozen e-scooter hire schemes.</p><p>Cities don't work when anyone can do anything they like - or at least creative chaos has its limits. To raise air quality, clean up streets and make getting around quick, we need rules, even if they are informal ones such as standing on the right on Tube escalators. \"Regulators are on the back foot,\" says Dedring. Cities around the world are trying to show they are modern by backing test examples of each cool new thing - \"every city needs a driverless car trial or you are a loser\" - but the trick isn't to pick technologies, it's to set broad plans shaped around the things we might need in the future.</p><p>Rules might sort out one tough problem - how to get rid of diesel lorries, which don't convert easily to electric power, by moving cargo onto electric distribution vans from big hubs outside cities instead.</p><p>\"What would be the three or four things where London can lead?\" Dedring asks. Our city was an early adaptor of congestion charging - the system still hasn't been matched anywhere. So expand that, maybe a smarter system based on when and how far you drive inside the M25.</p><p>We are world leaders in public transport payments by contactless card. And we are ahead in measuring and dealing with bad air quality - to the point where London's air will be better than most cities. When that happens, will political pressure to go further drop away? According to Axel Bentsen, who founded Urban Sharing - a start-up based in Oslo that aims to provide ways to manage the shared use of new-tech forms of travel - we can't predict what will work. But we can make sure we don't get chaos: as happened a year ago when Chinese bike firms started flooding the streets with neon-coloured hire cycles. The future shouldn't be a freefor-all but a way of putting the right things in the right places.</p><p>Will those things still include cars? In Oslo, they are trying to keep vehicles out of the city centre altogether - replacing parking spots with bike lanes. It might sound a step too far for much bigger, far more congested London. But here, too, he says, it won't be long before we look at the days of uncontrolled car use in the way we now see the time when you could smoke on the Tube and in restaurants. \"It now seems crazy,\" he says. \"In 10 years children will ask their parents: 'You used to park here? really?' It's the same as smoking.\"</p><p>@Julian_Glover</p><p>The aim is to bring in eco solutions for 'the last mile', that stretch of journey which feels easier to do by car</p><p>Almost every lamppost in London could have a trickle charge capacity - park and plug in an electric car</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Innovation: a Lime electric scooter.

But we can make sure we don't get chaos: as happened a year ago when Chinese bike firms started flooding the streets with neon-coloured hire cycles. The future shouldn't be a free-for-all but a way of putting the right things in the right places.</p><p>Will those things still include cars? In Oslo, they are trying to keep vehicles out of the city centre altogether - replacing parking spots with bike lanes. It might sound a step too far for much bigger, far more congested London. But here, too, he says, it won't be long before we look at the days of uncontrolled car use in the way we now see the time when you could smoke on the Tube and in restaurants. \"It now seems crazy,\" he says. \"In 10 years children will ask their parents: 'You used to park here? really?' It's the same as smoking.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTONL-52660504</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP3-RT21-F021-638T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1428\"/><timeReceived>12:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>standard.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"27119\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The star players are facing demands for greater accountability and transparency. America is playing catch-up with the European Union whose competition commissioner,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">Margrethe Vestager,</url> has ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes, fined Facebook over its acquisition of WhatsApp and imposed billions of dollars' worth of antitrust penalties on Google.</p><p>In the US, executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter have now all testified before Congress during the past year. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, has called on Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation to protect consumers. In the meantime, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">is reportedly close to finishing</url> a privacy investigation into Facebook, which could lead to a major fine.</p><p>In a measure of how the mood on Capitol Hill is shifting, Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, faced several questions about big tech during his <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">Senate confirmation hearing,</url> a stark contrast to former attorney general Jeff Sessions' hearings two years ago when the issue did not arise.</p><p>Barr told the judiciary committee: \"I don't think big is necessarily bad, but I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers. \"</p><p>Tellingly, the questions to Barr were posed by senators from the Republican heartlands: Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Mike Lee of Utah. And last year, when Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the Senate, <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">some of the sharpest cross-examination</url> came from Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina.</p><p>On the Democratic side, senators Richard Blumenthal, Cory Booker and Warren have expressed a desire to clip the companies' wings, especially after the <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">Cambridge Analytica scandal</url> during the 2016 presidential election. </p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">took on</url>Amazon over its minimum wage and won. House newcomer Ocasio-Cortez       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">spoke out against</url>New York city's $3bn welcome package to Amazon, earning unlikely praise from an unlikely quarter.</p><p>\"I hate to admit it, but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a very good point,\" Fox News host Tucker Carlson said. \"It's hard to argue with the internal logic. The richest man in the world just got $2bn in taxpayer subsidies. How does that work?\"</p><p>An illustration depicting Carlson and Warren in bed together was published last month by the New Republic along with the headline, <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">\"The One Issue the Left and Right Can Agree On\"</url>, and an article written by Matt Stoller, policy director of the Open Markets Institute.</p><p>In an interview, Stoller suggested that big tech is bringing together conservatives' anti-monopoly streak with progressives' suspicion of big business and wealth inequality. \"You're seeing a real ideological change and I don't think it's isolated. It's a rightwing and centrist and leftwing thing. People are realising we've been ignoring power in our society and the power held by tech platforms that control the flow of information.\"</p><p>Facebook, which rules social networking, and Google, by far the biggest search engine, enjoy a near duopoly of online advertising, while Amazon is the dominant online retailer and stands accused of <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">putting the high street out of business.</url> Stoller said: \"I think people on the left and right understand these three companies are powerful and political. A few years ago, they were seen as cuddly, cool and progressive. Now it's 'Wait, you have a lot of market power, you control the flow of information and you're doing it to serve yourselves'.\"</p><p>Trump himself has weighed in (\"We are looking at [antitrust] very seriously,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">he told Axios on HBO last year),</url> though many believe his critique of Amazon is fuelled by animus towards founder Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post.</p><p>Indeed, the unwieldy coalition of political motivations - such as conservatives' complaint that online platforms show a leftwing bias - could lead to a lack of clarity that the tech giants might exploit.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">Scott Cleland,</url> former deputy coordinator for communications and information policy in the George HW Bush administration, said: \"While they are getting a lot of opposition, it's not focused enough. They're in a castle and no one's organised the catapults or which ramparts to target or found the weaknesses.\"</p><p>Congress bared its teeth last year when <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">it passed bipartisan legislation</url> to strengthen the policing of sex trafficking on websites such as Backpage.com. Despite opposition from many internet companies, it passed 97-2 in the Senate and was signed into law by Trump.</p><p>But big tech, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">spends millions of dollars on lobbying,</url> would be a far tougher proposition. The companies do not fit the traditional definition of monopolies that push up prices and inflict consumer suffering and it is not clear that existing antitrust laws could be applied. When the FTC previously investigated Google over how it displayed its search results, it concluded       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">there was no antitrust violation</url> and did not break it up. To force Google to part with YouTube and DoubleClick, or Facebook to get rid of Instagram and WhatsApp, would be a radical step that requires a cast iron legal argument.</p><p>Kristian Stout, associate director of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">International Center for Law &amp; Economics,</url> said: \"I'm very sceptical as to whether you would call them 'too big' in the classical sense because it's an ill-defined criterion. </p><p>\"There's always been a contingent of the Democratic party that's sceptical of big business in one form or another. Republicans are getting more interested because they say conservative speech is being suppressed, but using antitrust laws is absolutely the wrong way to deal with that.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">The most famous antitrust case</url> against a tech giant in recent times broke Microsoft's monopoly of the internet browser market. It was 1998, the year of Bill Clinton's impeachment, hardly a time of bipartisan harmony. In 2019, as a partial government drags on and partisan divisions run deeper than ever, big tech seems be the one issue that Washington can agree on. But these are unchartered waters.</p><p>Historian <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">Niall Ferguson,</url> a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, said: \"The difficulty here is that there are some quite different motivations behind going after big tech. Keeping everybody on the same page is difficult enough and there are these different options: do you do antitrust, do you do you tougher regulation or do you go down the Section 230 road?\"</p><p>Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, tech firms currently enjoy broad immunity from liability stemming from what users post on their services. </p><p>Some commentators have likened data to oil, and big tech to Standard Oil, the colossus owned by John D Rockefeller that was eventually <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">broken up by the supreme court in 1911</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">.</url> But Ferguson, who explores the power of big tech in his book       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/\">The Square and the Tower,</url> objected:  \" We are all in the position of being able to drill for oil and produce it every time we go online and start typing or take a film and post it on Instagram, so the analogy with Standard Oil is poor because oil is a finite resource in certain places and you can extract rents from being in those places.</p><p>\"In any case, unlike oil, which is just something which has industrial uses, data have all kinds of uses and the most important thing we've learnt is that our personal data is both valuable and can be exploited in ways that are harmful. So it's not right to say this is just the Standard Oil problem: these companies have the scale of these predecessors but, unlike them, they also have this role as, in effect, content publishers and news providers. So they're William Randolph Hearst meets John D Rockefeller meets Bill Gates.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-51398792</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VBG-WXR1-F021-623W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1498\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Can Google, after pioneering and protecting an apparent invasion of privacy, sell its browser to consumers as a privacy-first service?</p><p> Google is going to try. That\u2019s because the other browser makers are embracing privacy as a competitive advantage. Apple Inc. added cookie restrictions to Safari several years ago. Microsoft Corp. has been building a raft of tracking-prevention mechanisms into its Edge browser. And Mozilla Corp. has made paid privacy tools a core selling point of its Firefox service, though they\u2019ve failed to catch on so far, leading to job cuts last week.</p><p> When Google first introduced Chrome in 2008, it essentially marketed the new browser as an online operating system, one that would treat popular web servicesemail, messaging, video streamingas full-blown applications, rather than clunky web pages. Chrome was a fast, refreshing alternative to Firefox and Internet Explorer.</p><p> In the decade since, it has soared in popularity: Chrome today boasts 63% worldwide market share, according to StatCounter.</p><p> Chrome also became a huge source of data, facilitating an ecosystem of Google services that kept feeding its advertising engine with more user information. The browser\u2019s search box defaulted, of course, to Google, while users could log into the platform via Gmail to seamlessly access its products such Drive, Docs, Maps and YouTube, enabling the company to fill up ever-more jars of cookies.</p><p> The dominance of the browser raised privacy concerns. One test last year found a whopping 11,189 requests for cookies in a week of surfing on Chrome. But only recently has Google started comprehensively rethinking its privacy policies, partly due to regulatory pressure and changing consumer sentiments around data collection.</p><p> \u201cUsers are demanding greater privacyincluding transparency, choice and control over how their data is usedand it\u2019s clear the web ecosystem needs to evolve to meet these increasing demands,\u201d Justin Schuh, director of Chrome engineering, wrote in the blog post last week.</p><p> Google deserves a measure of credit for adopting consumer protections that could undermine its relationship with marketers and publishers, and also raise further antitrust scrutiny. Still, such policies stop far short of ridding Google of ad-tracking altogether: They may simply end up increasing the value of so-called first-party cookies, which websites collect directly from their users, rather than through intermediaries. One company well-positioned to keep gobbling those up from its many devoted users?

The search giant, which just helped Alphabet Inc. surpass a $1 trillion valuation, said it will eventually stop supporting third-party cookies in its ubiquitous Chrome browser.</p><p>The move won't end the Big Brother era of Big Tech, but Google is framing the decision as a significant step away from unbridled data mining. In a blog post, Google references privacy about a dozen times, an awkward pitch for a company that built a juggernaut of a business by tapping into cookies from its billions of users. Can Google, after pioneering and protecting an apparent invasion of privacy, sell its browser to consumers as a privacy-first service?</p><p>Google is going to try. That's because the other browser makers are embracing privacy as a competitive advantage. Apple Inc. added cookie restrictions to Safari several years ago. Microsoft Corp. has been building a raft of tracking-prevention mechanisms into its Edge browser. And Mozilla Corp. has made paid privacy tools a core selling point of its Firefox service, though they've failed to catch on so far, leading to job cuts last week.</p><p>When Google first introduced Chrome in 2008, it essentially marketed the new browser as an online operating system, one that would treat popular web services_email, messaging, video streaming_as full-blown applications, rather than clunky web pages. Chrome was a fast, refreshing alternative to Firefox and Internet Explorer. In the decade since, it has soared in popularity: Chrome today boasts 63% worldwide market share, according to StatCounter.</p><p>Chrome also became a huge source of data, facilitating an ecosystem of Google services that kept feeding its advertising engine with more user information. The browser's search box defaulted, of course, to Google, while users could log into the platform via Gmail to seamlessly access its products such Drive, Docs, Maps and YouTube, enabling the company to fill up ever-more jars of cookies. The dominance of the browser raised privacy concerns. One test last year found a whopping 11,189 requests for cookies in a week of surfing on Chrome. But only recently has Google started comprehensively rethinking its privacy policies, partly due to regulatory pressure and changing consumer sentiments around data collection.</p><p>\"Users are demanding greater privacy_including transparency, choice and control over how their data is used_and it's clear the web ecosystem needs to evolve to meet these increasing demands,\" Justin Schuh, director of Chrome engineering, wrote in the blog post last week.</p><p>Google deserves a measure of credit for adopting consumer protections that could undermine its relationship with marketers and publishers, and also raise further antitrust scrutiny. Still, such policies stop far short of ridding Google of ad-tracking altogether: They may simply end up increasing the value of so-called first-party cookies, which websites collect directly from their users, rather than through intermediaries. One company well-positioned to keep gobbling those up from its many devoted users?

Can Google, after pioneering and protecting an apparent invasion of privacy, sell its browser to consumers as a privacy-first service?Google is going to try. That's because the other browser makers are embracing privacy as a competitive advantage. Apple Inc. added cookie restrictions to Safari several years ago. Microsoft Corp. has been building a raft of tracking-prevention mechanisms into its Edge browser. And Mozilla Corp. has made paid privacy tools a core selling point of its Firefox service, though they've failed to catch on so far, leading to job cuts last week.When Google first introduced Chrome in 2008, it essentially marketed the new browser as an online operating system, one that would treat popular web services \u2014 e-mail, messaging, video streaming \u2014 as full-blown applications, rather than clunky web pages. Chrome was a fast, refreshing alternative to Firefox and Internet Explorer. In the decade since, it has soared in popularity: Chrome today boasts 63 per cent worldwide market share, according to StatCounter.Chrome also became a huge source of data, facilitating an ecosystem of Google services that kept feeding its advertising engine with more user information. The browser's search box defaulted, of course, to Google, while users could log into the platform via Gmail to seamlessly access its products such Drive, Docs, Maps and YouTube, enabling the company to fill up ever-more jars of cookies. The dominance of the browser raised privacy concerns. One test last year found a whopping 11,189 requests for cookies in a week of surfing on Chrome. But only recently has Google started comprehensively rethinking its privacy policies, partly due to regulatory pressure and changing consumer sentiments around data collection.'Users are demanding greater privacy \u2014 including transparency, choice and control over how their data is used \u2014 and it's clear the web ecosystem needs to evolve to meet these increasing demands,' Justin Schuh, director of Chrome engineering, wrote in the blog post last week.Google deserves a measure of credit for adopting consumer protections that could undermine its relationship with marketers and publishers, and also raise further antitrust scrutiny. Still, such policies stop far short of ridding Google of ad-tracking altogether: They may simply end up increasing the value of so-called first-party cookies, which websites collect directly from their users, rather than through intermediaries.

This is a sentence the reader has to keep in mind throughout Levy\u2019s new book, which documents how the seeds of what has gone wrong for the company were planted years before 2016 in a series of heedless or needlessly aggressive decisions that are deeply rooted in the history and culture of the company itself.</p><p><br/>When it comes to what we actually can prove about the 2016 votes in the United Kingdom (which resulted in Brexit) and in the United States (which gave us President Donald Trump), it\u2019s never been demonstrated that Facebook and its ad policies made any difference. Even so, it\u2019s now indisputable that various political actors (including Russia) have tried to use Facebook that way, and that the company made it easy for them to try.<br/>Levy\u2019s introductory chapter is designed to show both the reputational heights Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his company briefly reached and the depths to which they\u2019ve both now fallen. The author draws a brisk line between Zuckerberg\u2019s triumphant surprise visit to Lagos, Nigeria, in August 2016\u2014where he meets a range of programmers and would-be startup entrepreneurs as well as top government officials\u2014and the unexpected outcome of the American election in November that year. The latter inspired a gathering storm of critics to point directly at Facebook as the source of that outcome\u2019s unexpectedness.<br/>This juxtaposition works to draw readers into the thematic heart of the book but also suggests, a bit misleadingly, that Facebook\u2019s massive loss of public regard starting in 2016 was an abrupt, unexpected one. But what the author documents in his introductory chapter and throughout the book is that Facebook\u2019s unforced errors have amounted to a car crash more of the slow-motion variety; you can\u2019t look away, but also it never seems to end.<br/>Nothing in Levy\u2019s narrative arc for Facebook and its principal founder will come as a surprise to anyone who has followed the company\u2019s fortunes over the 15 years. You could fill a specialty bookstore with nothing but Facebook-related books published in the last decade or so, starting with Ben Mezrich\u2019s\u00a0The Accidental Billionaires, [1]\u00a0later adapted by Aaron Sorkin for the David Fincher-directed movie\u00a0The Social Network. Mezrich\u2019s book, and almost all of the books published about Facebook since then, fall into two broad categories: (1) Look At The Great Things These Geniuses Have Done, or (2) Look At All The Pathological Things These Twisted Guys Have Done. With the exception of David Kirkpatrick\u2019s\u00a0The Facebook Effect\u00a0 [2](a book on the company\u2019s early years that Levy credits by name in his acknowledgments), the authors of most of these other books typically have tried to distill the story of Facebook into lessons\u2014either what not to do or what must be done\u2014regarding social media and big tech-company successes. One way or another, they\u2019ve almost all had axes to grind.<br/>That was never going to be the kind of story Levy\u2014whose 2011 book on Google,\u00a0In The Plex, [3]\u00a0is the best journalistic account of that company\u2019s history and its impact on the tech world\u2014would write about Facebook. Levy\u2019s books and his admirably accessible body of tech journalism for journals from\u00a0Newsweek\u00a0to\u00a0MacWorld\u00a0to\u00a0Wired\u00a0consistently demonstrate how he\u2019s driven by the facts rather than by any philosophical or political agenda. And that\u2019s exactly why, once Levy has layered on so many new facts about Facebook, its principals, and its various lapses and betrayals, piling on the details from hundreds of interviews, putting all the pieces of every part of Facebook\u2019s story into one place, his most even-handed conclusions are still damning:<br/>\u201cThe troubled post-election version of Facebook was by no means a different company from the one it was before, but instead very much a continuation of what started in Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s dorm room 15 years earlier. It is a company that benefits from and struggles with the legacy of its origin, its hunger for growth, and its idealistic and terrifying mission. Its audaciousness\u2014and that of its leader\u2014led it to be so successful. And that same audaciousness came with a punishing price.\u201d<br/>And what was that price? Per Levy, \u201cFacebook now admits that the damage [from the company\u2019s decisions to promote rapid growth over everything else] turned out far more extensive than expected, and is not easily repaired. All the while Mark Zuckerberg and his team insist, despite the scandals, that Facebook is still overwhelmingly a force for good in the world.\u201d<br/>Even now\u2014even after reading Levy\u2019s increasingly unhappy account of Facebook\u2019s growth in size and profitability on the one hand and its growth in scandalously negligent or callous treatment of users and their data on the other\u2014I\u2019m still inclined to agree that Facebook is a force for good. I\u2019m biased: Were it not for our ability to stay in touch on Facebook while half a world apart, the woman who became my wife in 2017 and I would not be married today. But, just as important, I\u2019ve seen so many instances in which individual users and communities have found constructive uses for Facebook\u2019s many features, ranging from the broadly political to the deeply personal. I\u2019ve been a defender of some of Facebook\u2019s approaches to real problems, such as its Internet.org project (later known as\u00a0Free Basics [4]) and its (apparent [5]) commitment to end-to-end encryption.<br/>But again and again in Levy\u2019s book I stumble across things like Facebook\u2019s deployment of a mobile app called Onavo Protect, which purported to provide VPN (virtual private network) services for one\u2019s phone, but whose real purpose was to gather user data about how they used other apps.\u00a0For a year or two I had that Onavo app on my own damned phone!\u00a0As Levy writes, \u201cit takes a certain amount of chutzpah to present people with a privacy tool whose purpose was to gain their data.\u201d<br/>Far more common in the Facebook story than perverse examples like Onavo Protect are the occasions in which the company failed to anticipate problems that would arise from the markets it pushed itself into with little awareness of how its services might be misused\u2014especially in the absence of Facebook personnel who spoke the dominant languages in those markets and who might at least theoretically identify content that violated Facebook\u2019s content policies or other problematic uses. Take Myanmar, for example. Levy shows that Facebook learned in 2014 about how its services were being used maliciously in Myanmar, a country where large-scale mobile-phone internet access was just taking off.<br/>I learned about Facebook\u2019s impact in Myanmar at roughly the same time through my contacts in Burmese civil society, and my first reaction was just as brain-dead as Facebook\u2019s turned out to be. When I was told that incidents of civil violence were being reported on Facebook, my first thought was that this was positive\u2014that the increasing ubiquity of smartphones with cameras was making rogue government officials and factions more accountable. What I didn\u2019t immediately grasp (my Burmese friends politely schooled me), and what Facebook took far longer to grasp, was that\u00a0false\u00a0reports of crime and sexual assaults were being used to stir up violence against innocents, with a growing genocidal focus on the country\u2019s oppressed and persecuted Rohingya minority. Levy then outlines how Facebook\u2019s property WhatsApp, with its end-to-end encryption features and its built-in ability to amplify messages, including pro-violence messages, exacerbated the civil-discord problem in Myanmar (just as it eventually was shown to have done in the Philippines and in Brazil):<br/>\u201cFacebook contracted with a firm called BSR to investigate its activity in Myanmar. It found that Facebook rushed into a country where digital illiteracy was rampant: most Internet users did not know how to open a browser or set up an email account or assess online content. Yet their phones were preinstalled with Facebook. The report said that the hate speech and misinformation on Facebook suppressed the expression of Myanmar\u2019s most vulnerable users. And worse: \u2018Facebook has become a useful platform for those seeking to incite violence and cause offline harm.\u2019 A UN report had reached a similar conclusion.\u201d<br/>It\u2019s fair to note, as Facebook\u2019s defenders (who sometimes have included me) have noted, that all new communications technologies are destined to be misused by somebody. But Facebook\u2019s reckless stress on its grow-first-fix-problems-later strategy more or less guaranteed that the most harmful aspects of the misuses of these new media would be exacerbated rather than mitigated. By 2018, the company began to realize it was at the bottom of a reputational hole and needed to stop digging; when Zuckerberg testified before the U.S. Senate in 2018, he responded to Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2019s (D\u2013Vt.) question about Myanmar by saying \u201cwhat\u2019s happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy, and we need to do more.\u201d<br/>That last line is a theme that appears again and again in the final third of the book, uttered by different top executives at Facebook. \u201cWe know we have more work to do,\u201d an exec responded when reporters revealed that Facebook\u2019s AI-fueled self-service ad product created the targeted category \u201cJew haters.\u201d\u00a0Writes Levy: \u201cInvestigative reporters at ProPublica found 2,274 potential users identified by Facebook as fitting that category, one of more than 26,000 provided by Facebook, which apparently never vetted the [category] list itself.\u201d<br/>When Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, a Google veteran, met with the Congressional Black Caucus, she didn\u2019t have a particularly strong defense for Facebook\u2019s having (in Levy\u2019s words) \u201chosted Russian propaganda that fueled white prejudice against black people\u201d or violating civil-rights laws \u201cbecause it allowed advertisers to discriminate against African-Americans.\u201d Sandberg was reduced to \u201crepeating, almost like a mantra, \u2018We will do better.'\u201d Sandberg later told Levy that \u201cI walked out of there saying we, and I, have a lot of work to do.\u201d This has become the paradigmatic Facebook response when any new scandal emerges from the company\u2019s shortsighted strategic choices to privilege growth over due diligence.<br/>If there is one major exception to the company\u2019s institutional willingness to plunge ahead into new markets and new opportunities to reap revenue, it is its cautiousness in dealing with American conservatives, primarily driven by Facebook\u2019s head of global policy, Joel Kaplan. Levy writes that<br/>\u201cfor years right-wing conservatives had been complaining that Facebook\u2014run by those liberals in Silicon Valley\u2014discriminated against them by down-ranking their posts. The claim was unsupported by data, and by many measures conservative content was overrepresented on Facebook. Fox News routinely headed the list of most-shared posts on the service, and even smaller right-wing sites like the Daily Wire were punching above their weight.\u201d<br/>Facebook\u2019s intense desire to be perceived as lacking political bias seems to have led to policies and outreach efforts\u2014including a big powwow in Menlo Park where Zuckerberg and Sandberg personally attempted to mollify prominent conspiracy theorists like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck\u2013that added up to white-glove treatment for American conservatives. Beck, at least, told Levy he was impressed with Zuckerberg\u2019s sincerity: \u201cI sat across the table from him to try to gauge him [and he] was a little enigmatic, but I thought he was trying to do the right thing.\u201d Even so, Levy writes, \u201cafter leaving Menlo Park the conservatives returned to complaining about Facebook\u2019s treatment of them\u2014while piling up millions of views because of their skill in exploiting Facebook\u2019s algorithms.\u201d<br/>The attempts to accommodate conservative critics, occurring simultaneously with Facebook\u2019s promises to \u201cdo better\u201d on other content moderation issues, illustrate the bind in which the company now finds itself. It\u2019s voicing its commitment to be more proactive in moderating malicious content and disinformation while simultaneously reassuring the squeakiest political wheels that, no,\u00a0their\u00a0content and policies won\u2019t be subjected to any Facebook-imposed test of factuality or truth. In other words, it\u2019s promising both to police more content and to police content less. Facebook\u2019s laboring now to create a \u201ccontent oversight board,\u201d a kind of \u201cSupreme Court [6]\u201d where Facebook content decisions can be appealed.<br/>I\u2019m skeptical of that whole oversight-board project\u2014not least because it seems largely to sidestep the other big bucket of problems for Facebook, which is its handling of user data. I\u2019m also\u00a0skeptical [7]\u00a0about broad claims that\u00a0Facebook\u2019s content algorithms and ads truly manipulate us [8]\u2014in the sense of robbing us of ordinary human independence and agency\u2014but that skepticism has no bearing on the ethical question of whether Facebook should allow malign actors to exploit user data in efforts to manipulate us (e.g., by suppressing voter turnout). Whether those efforts are effective or not isn\u2019t relevant to the ethical questions, just as when a drunk in a bar misses when he swings at you has no bearing on whether he can be charged with attempted assault.<br/>Finally, I\u2019m most skeptical as to whether anything Facebook tries to do\u00a0on its own\u00a0is going to either restore Facebook\u2019s public reputation or blunt the impulse of government policymakers, both in the United States and elsewhere, to impose hobbling and even punitive regulation on the entire social-media industry (and on the tech industry generally).<br/>It\u2019s clear that\u00a0one reason Zuckerberg and Sandberg have been scrambling to find an accommodation that works\u2014first and foremost with the U.S. government but also with the European Union (E.U.) and with non-E.U. nations\u2014is that they know they need to get out of the crosshairs, especially as more of their company\u2019s story continues to come to light. Their problem now is that Steven Levy\u2019s\u00a0Facebook: The Inside Story\u00a0has instantly become the indispensable single-volume resource for all policymakers everywhere when it comes to Facebook\u2014not because it sets out to take the company down, but because the facts it reports leave readers with no choice but to recognize how the company\u2019s indisputable successes have been undermined by its indisputable systemic deficiencies.<br/>My takeaway is that Facebook could still manage a win out of all this\u2014if it seizes\u00a0this moment as an opportunity to embrace an ethical framework that\u2019s designed for something bigger than just solving Facebook problems. I don\u2019t believe the company\u2019s bad behavior (or negligence\u2014there\u2019s plenty of both) can tell us what to think of this whole sector of the internet economy and what industry-level regulation or law should look like. As I\u2019ve argued in my own\u00a0book [9], I believe a new ethical framework has to be built and shared, industry-wide (affecting more companies than just Facebook). It needs to be informed by all stakeholders, including users, governments, and civil society as well as the companies themselves\u2014and it needs to privilege\u00a0fiduciary obligations to users and the general public [10]\u00a0even over any commitment to growth and profitability. Part of these obligations will entail, yes, a commitment to fighting disinformation, treating it as\u00a0a cybersecurity problem [11]\u2014even when political stakeholders complain.<br/>That\u2019s just my view\u2014other critics will argue for different approaches, some of which will center on more regulation or laws or other government interventions, while others will argue for fewer but better-crafted ones. But what all Facebook\u2019s critics, and the tech industry\u2019s critics, will have in common is this: going forward, we all will be citing stuff we learned from Levy\u2019s\u00a0Facebook: The Inside Story.<br/>Endnotes<br/>\u201cThe Accidental Billionaires,\u201d: <url

He is currently on secondment to the Prime Minister of Barbados as Special Envoy on Investment and Financial Services and Chairman of the Financial Services Commission of Barbados.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The new economy needs a development model that is people-centric, not production-driven. Emphasis, therefore, must be on the development of human capital. But, public education and health are not enough to break out of the middle-economy track. The world's most pressing problems, from climate change to the future of work are all manifestations of inequality. The role of government is to not only be a more effective provider of learning and health, but also to be an agent for greater access to opportunity and changing patterns of ownership at all levels.</p><p>What is the best development model? Is it the new mercantilism of making locally and selling globally? Or is it the new interventionism of bending trade rules and national security preferences to promote local tech firms? As Trumpism reigns and internationalism retreats, both ideas are in the ascendency. Perhaps, a better alternative is to start from one of the few certainties that today's jobs will be unrecognisable in 50 years' time and future jobs may not be existing today. Consequently, what is needed is a people-centric development model, not production-centred development.<br/><br/>A people-centric development model recognises that a country can only gain wealth sustainably by increasing the amount its citizens can charge the world's consumers for their skills, talent and service. Education is at the heart of this development, but it is learning in the widest sense. Beyond formal schooling, education in this sense embraces skills training, on-the-job experience, exposure, travel and lifelong learning. It is education that is not only sensitive to new trends but also, future-proofed by empowering citizens with the ability to adapt as demand changes. Darwin's law of evolution that is often misstated as the survival of the fittest, is actually survival of the most adaptable. Giraffes are not the fastest and fittest but they survived because they could reach their food. Adaptability is reactive. Our approach to learning must naturally feed innovation. We must have a national system of innovation that dovetails with our national educational system.<br/><br/>However, a well-educated and healthy citizenry is insufficient. That development model works to a point, but then it hits diminishing returns. To break out of the middle-income trap, ownership also matters. This is often neglected in the teaching of economics, where the emphasis is on income, not wealth and original conditions. But, this misses an essential truth: economic insecurity is rife. The average person has no real assets and is just one natural disaster, one illness, one lost job away from tipping into poverty. As their lives are brimming with risk, they act in ways that appear risk averse, unwilling to take a chance or uninterested in change. It is also true that when there are no safety nets, some are driven to more desperate measures. Those are the minority. Most take flight. To grasp opportunities and take risks, most need safety nets, buffers and assets to fall back on, not more encouragement and lectures.<br/><br/>Ownership matters to a country's development for various reasons and here, I fall back on an example that I have previously used. If a robot that can do everything that I can do is invented and I own that robot, it would be great for me. I can send my robot out to work every day while I sit at home, read a book and play with my family. John Maynard Keynes thought that by 2030, our principal societal economic problem would be: what to do with the copious amounts of leisure time and how to replace the purpose to life that comes from work. He was wrong. Because, if that robot is owned instead by Apple, Microsoft, Google or Facebook, then technology is not my aid, but my threat. I will have to work longer hours for less and pursue the ever shrinking space of those activities that the robot does not presently occupy. The difference is not technology. We are dealing with the same robot. The key is not whether I am educated or not. The difference is ownership. The whole discussion on the future of work continues under a massive misapprehension. Technology is not the threat to labour, ownership is. Amartya Sen taught us something very similar about famines: they are not about the availability of food, but about entitlement to food. Ownership matters.<br/><br/>Tech zealots scream about the democratising effect of technological advances. They look accusingly at the rest of us as if they are the vanguards of change and the rest of us are reactionary elements of the status quo. But, after the initial disruption led by dropouts from uber-exclusive Ivy League universities, the ownership of technology is increasingly concentrated. They say that data is the new oil, and so we should imagine that the same battles for the control of oil will ensue. From the mid-1940s to the 1970s, industrialisation was powered by oil. Seven transnational oil companies, known as the Seven Sisters, controlled oil reserves. Today's seven sisters, are the big-five tech firms: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. They are the five most valuable listed companies in the world, with a total market capitalisation of around $3 trillion. They are worth more than any five firms in history, including the oil giants. And they have almost half a trillion dollars of cash lying around waiting to be deployed. How? By investing in innovation? No. The cash lies in a bank account waiting to be used to snap up any emerging competitor. Facebook owns Instagram. Microsoft owns Skype, and the list goes on.<br/><br/>It is not by coincidence either, that these five firms are all American and that each of them have huge financial and technology support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States (US) Department of Defense. This is industrial policy US-style and it is all about ownership of the fuel of the new economy.<br/><br/>Indeed, many of our global challenges masquerade as technical problems when really they are about equity. Climate change is an excellent case in point. Those on the front line of climate change, at risk of their homes being washed away or of weather extremes destroying their livelihoods on marginal lands, are the poor. The wealthy live on high ground, in fresh air. They earned or continue to earn their spoils from current or past activities that contributed to climate change. So long as that imbalance between victims and perpetrators continues, the march of climate change will continue. Climate change is not a problem of progress or a challenge of science. It is just the most current, devastating manifestation of inequality. It is political economy, like so much else.<br/><br/>The government's development strategy then must not just be about lifelong learning opportunities, but on opening up of new pathways to ownership to the dispossessed, supporting the local ownership of data and the technologies of the new economy and acquiring ownership of the big tech firms. There are a variety of paths and beachheads. And technology can help. Creating the right regulatory environment for new financial instruments that tap into ordinary savers and entrepreneurs, like peer-to-peer lenders, must become a priority. Technology makes these firms easier to establish.<br/><br/>The government can support access by requiring all companies who win a government contract to have some element of common ownership, such as a proportion of shares owned by peer-to-peer lenders, credit unions, small shareholders or employees. And labour and ordinary savers should pool their savings to acquire ownership in the commanding heights of the new world economy; the big five tech firms are all publicly listed. All of the savings of all worker pension funds in the world could own majority stakes in these big five tech firms, if they wanted. Changing ownership of the big five, guiding their management and investment and switching where the dividends go, would make a transformative impact on the way technology drives development.<br/><br/>Technology should also be used to improve access to economic opportunity. If the only way to get a government licence or process goods through a port is to queue up for days, lobby a minister or pass a favour, opportunities will be narrow. Delay and randomness are the boulevards that lead to corruption and elitism. Let the technology-enabled government lead to swift, predictable and transparent decisions and access, investment and growth will follow.<br/><br/>One of the surprising things about the most prescient analysis of The Great Crash 1929 by J K Galbraith was the role played by inequality in the instability of the economy. To paraphrase Rajan and Zingales, capitalism has to be saved from the capitalists. Access must be secured, otherwise equity will be lost and society undermined. It is the perennial entangled history of capitalism, populism and war. But, watch out for we are once more on the brink.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EPWKLY-0048541094</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EPWKLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM4-B0R1-JB5M-W02S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365197</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1526\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Economic &amp;

Mark, I apologize for some of the technical issues we had prior. It was very kind of you to call in. Mark Armstrong, the son of Neil Armstrong. So mission's scrubbed, Saturday is the next shot. Here is \"THE FIVE.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Dana Perino, along with Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld, Donna Brazile, and Katie Pavlich. It is 5:00 in New York City. This is THE FIVE. A new era in American space travel put on hold, but just for now, bad weather postponing SpaceX's launch of two NASA astronauts into orbit from Cape Canaveral, Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It would've been the first manned rocket launch on U.S. soil in nearly a decade. The next attempt is set for Saturday afternoon. Let's go to live to Phil Keating. He's standing by in Cape Canaveral with a quick update for us. You even braved a tornado today.</p><p>PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. We had a tornado warning in the afternoon. I was talking to you on your 2:00 show. There's no way around it. This is a massively disappointing ending of what was going to be such a triumphant day. SpaceX has been working for this moment for 10 years. Elon Musk had a dream of launching astronauts on board his rockets, his capsules.</p><p>And also for NASA, they pride themselves on the public-private partnership that began after the retirement of the Space Shuttle System. All of the technical issues on the crew, Dragon and the Falcon 9 rocket, which is still sitting over there on launch pad 39A. They were all great. They were all a go. This whole mission was a go.</p><p>It all boiled down all day long to how the weather would be come launch time. And as you can see on the countdown clock, we got 16 minutes and 54 seconds away from ignition of those nine Merlin engines. But suddenly, that's the moment the countdown clock froze. And then it was quickly declared that the launch was scrubbed for the day due to weather.</p><p>We were hoping that the skies would open up just long enough. I mean, the day began with deluge of rain and lightning and thunder. We had several of those bands come through here. It was really a wet day. And everybody was just hoping that the 60 percent chance that it could work out would happen. But in the end, it did not. So what will happen now, I believe, the astronauts are going to actually speak before the cameras once they get back off the capsule.</p><p>It could happen, like, around 5:30 and between 5:30 and 6:00. But we will do it again in three days. Saturday will be the rescheduled launch day at 3:22 in the afternoon Eastern Time, Dana.</p><p>PERINO: All right. Phil, thanks so much, appreciate it. Let's take it around the table. Katie Pavlich, I know you are a big space fan. And even though the weather scuttled things today, it was a pretty important moment for America showing the capability of the private sector and the government coming together and to show little muscle around the world in the space program.</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. You know, Dana, I grew up in a place called Mars Hill where Pluto was discovered as a planet. And I still believe that it is a planet. So you are right. I am a space nerd. And I love stuff like this. And to watch all the innovation and to look at the technology that has changed so much just in the 10 years since American astronauts were launched into space is amazing.</p><p>I remember in 2012 when the Discovery Shuttle was flown over D.C. to its, you know, final resting place. It felt really sad that we know longer had this program to be sending American astronauts to the International Space Station. And for me, I really love that America is regaining its independence in space, to be able to send Americans from American soil up to space, whether it's for scientific reasons, for national security projects, all of the above.</p><p>So in a time, especially now, where America has been locked down for the last three months between the Space Force and this, to see all this innovation and to see that dreams can be accomplished on the largest scales. And yes, every single is so controlled and all of the engineering that goes on here. And then the weather is one thing that they say they can't control.</p><p>And the NASA commentators were talking about that right before they called off the launch. They can do all these things with this technology, but that. So maybe someday, but looking forward to Saturday. I wouldn't call this a failure by any means. I would say we just have to wait for three more days.</p><p>PERINO: Yeah. And Greg, I was thinking about this, like, in the middle of 12 weeks of being in lockdown, that this was a real moment for everyone to be like OK, there's hope. There's light at the end of the tunnel. We have still got it.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. I mean, assuming you believe this is real, I mean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Are you guys really -- I mean -- OK, I just want to point out. I just want to point out I saw Phil Keating in the hallway. I am in New York City, OK? Phil Keating is getting a cappuccino in the Fox kitchen. So don't put this -- by the way, I'm -- maybe I'm kidding. We can all empathize. I hate it when my flight gets cancelled.</p><p>The least that NASA and SpaceX can do is maybe get him an upgrade on the next flight. Maybe some drink vouchers and a pass for the -- if they have a nice lounge. They could sit in the lounge. It's going to happen on Saturday. Everything is going to be great. But to Katie's point, it is a reminder that America is the land of exploration and adventure, and would kind of put that on pause.</p><p>I was talking to Dana about this a while ago. When we talk about computers, there's this thing called Morris Law (ph), which says it -- we double the number of transistors on a chip every two years. Imagine if we had that kind of exponential growth in air and space travel. We would be going to Mars for breakfast and then have lunch on Venus, instead of being stuck at a hub in Philly trying to get to O'Hare and wanting to throw ourselves off a building.</p><p>But that's -- I mean, we really kind of have dropped the ball in space travel, if it's real. But we don't know that.</p><p>PERINO: If it's real. Donna, it was also a moment of a lot of unity, which the country was feeling today. And I know that you love innovation. And I was thinking about the private sector and the government coming together, and this is -- this could be a model for the way forward on maybe not just in space.</p><p>DONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS HOST: Dana, when I found out we were paying the Russians $86 million just to hitch a ride up to the Space Station, I said really? So I was excited to see this new space capsule. You know, growing up during the so-called space race, down in Louisiana. I mean, my family used to gather on the TV set and just look forward to, you know, sending men and women up to space.</p><p>So I'm looking forward to Saturday at 3:22 p.m. Trust me. I will be home, properly dressed. And of course, I will have myself a drink since it will be 3:22. And I'm going to root for our astronauts to the Space Station. And yes, we can save money in the process.</p><p>PERINO: Jesse, let's get some final thoughts from you.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Oh, a Democrat wanting to save money, wow, amazing, can't believe it. Also Democrats that's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: -- that the Russians are helping. Yeah, usually, when we pay the Russians for something, we call it a dossier. But I don't want to get political, Donna. I don't want to get political. I will say this. I had a bad feeling about this launch. I am beginning to think, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, that Trump might be a jinx with this kind of stuff.</p><p>You know, he goes down there and they don't launch. Remember the Daytona 500, rain delay. Remember he goes to Alabama for the LSU game, Alabama loses. There is a lot of pressure when the commander-in-chief comes. But in the same sense, the president with this, and then we expect it Saturday. And you know, sometimes in you tease something and then you bring it back, it really heightens your anticipation for when it really happens. So I'm considering this just a tease.</p><p>But when this goes up, along with Space Force, the president's legacy with space is going to be great. You compare that to Barack Obama's space legacy. That's almost as bad as his legacy on Earth. I mean, he slashed the Constellation program. W had that all geared up. And then I think, like, Neil Armstrong had to send a nasty letter to Barack Obama because he slashed NASA.</p><p>So I am glad this is happening. And I'm ready to see some aliens. So on Saturday, I will be there with Donna with a drink.</p><p>PERINO: All right, unity.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: Coming up, President Trump accusing Twitter of election interference. And we are fact-checking his tweets, what Trump is now threatening to do to the social media giant. That's next.</p><p>PAVLICH: Trump taking on Twitter, the president threatening to regulate or close down social media companies after Twitter started fact-checking his tweets. Trump accusing the platform of silencing conservatives and trying to interfere with the 2020 elections. It's in response to Twitter, adding a warning label to his tweets about mail-in ballots and voter fraud.</p><p>So Greg, this is a whole can of worms. But Twitter is using CNN and the Washington Post as their fact-checkers.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, I mean, think about this. What is easier? To throw away a bag of votes, or get a Russian troll farm to help you swing an election. I think it's easier to throw away a bag of votes. But anyway, the thing is this whole fact-checking thing is designed as a way to tackle misinformation, which would be good if there was a balance and misinformation.</p><p>But we do know from research that the news media is about 90 percent liberal. So the right generally is over-policed daily compared to the left. It's like a highway where only the red cars get pulled over, while the blue cars keep going. That's how we police misinformation. And I think that this kind of fact-checking thing, this is an example of it, which is extend the practice of going after things that are said by Trump or said by conservative outfits.</p><p>While all -- I mean imagine if you tried to fact-check everything said against Trump, from the Russian collusion, to the accusations of racism, to the 25th Amendment that went on for a couple of months, and then now you have the blood libel of the Coronavirus, in which you have certain people on MSNBC saying, you know, he's got 100,000 deaths on his hands.</p><p>It's impossible to actually fact-check the immensity of these claims against Trump. So you know it's only going to work one way. They are just going to pull over the red cars and let the blue cars drive by.</p><p>PAVLICH: You know, Dana, for a while now, big social media companies like Twitter and Facebook have been threatened with regulation, because they claim that they are just a public platform but then they do things like edit content, ban content, in this case, fact-check President Trump's tweets. But you interviewed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for your show tomorrow. Let's get a sneak peek at that and get your response.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Twitter decided for the first time ever to fact-check one of President Trump's tweets. I wonder if you thought that that Twitter may have made a wrong decision here.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this. You know, I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. I think in general private companies, probably shouldn't be -- or especially these platform companies shouldn't be in the position of doing that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAVLICH: Dana?</p><p>PERINO: So that is a policy that the Facebook team put in place last October, around the time that I first interviewed him. And the uproar from the left has never let up against Facebook on this. They want him to be policing President Trump's tweets, but not their own. And it has been something pretty interesting to watch that they have stuck to their guns.</p><p>I further asked him about, like, well, what would be the line? You know, is there a line that they would cross? And he was very clear. They look back at the Supreme Court rulings from the past in terms of free speech and if it doesn't have imminent harm to somebody or misinformation that would hurt somebody, then from when it comes to political speech they're going to be hands-off.</p><p>And I think that's probably the right decision. If I was sitting there, I don't know exactly what I would do. I don't have all the information. But I think that's the right thing. I think free speech is something that Americans cherish. American companies should cherish. And there was no need for Twitter to get involved. Yesterday, like, why fact-check that particular tweet?</p><p>There are hundreds of tweets that you could choose, but they chose the mail-in voting. And there is controversy about mail-in voting. There are statistics. There are different things. It took Seattle about 10 years to get it right, Jason Rans (ph) sort of big -- a great piece on this to explain that it's pretty good now, but it took 10 years for them to get it to be good.</p><p>So I think there's room for a debate. I just don't understand why Twitter decided to step in on that particular tweet yesterday, when there were plenty of other tweets, including one yesterday that they could've taken action on.</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, Jesse, shouldn't they be also then fact-checking -- I don't know, members of the Chinese Communist Party who are spewing lies about the Coronavirus on Twitter? They aren't doing that.</p><p>WATTERS: No, because they have too much money in China. I mean, why don't they fact-check pencil neck? I mean, he's been lying about collusion for three years. I would put a little fact-check behind any of those tweets. And I know why they chose this to fact-check, because it is the only way they are going to beat Trump, is ballot harvesting. It's not even a fact- check, Katie.</p><p>It is spin. I mean, like, I have sheets of paper here of reports that I found on Twitter that say that there's a lot of abuse with mail ballots. It's from the New York Times, the AP, CBS. I mean, these aren't fact- checkers. This is like the Democrat state of the union rebuttal. And they don't understand how weak it makes the left look, because Biden can't take him out.</p><p>The media can't take him out. Now, they are asking big tech for help? I mean, you guys can't do this on your own? Why can't Biden re-tweet Trump and say this or that? That's his job. And then you find out the guy in charge of enforcing the rules on Twitter is some left-wing hack that called the Trump folks Nazis. The whole thing is so cooked up that it's almost helping the president because it makes him, again, look like he's got everybody against him.</p><p>You know, Twitter, the FBI, the mainstream media. And he's going to shove it right back in their face in November.</p><p>PAVLICH: So Donna, those arguments --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: -- all of the whining, all of this whining, Jesus Christ. Jesse, I mean, I wish I could send you some tissue but I'd have to be six feet from you, so therefore, I will have to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: I'm not whining. You're the one who's whining.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: -- the social media.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: -- if Biden was a real contender --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He's stuff this right down Trump's throat, but he can't so he needs Silicon Valley to help him out.</p><p>BRAZILE: You're talking over me because you're talking nonsense, these conspiracy theories do cost a lot. And the information that you put out -- the president's tweets should have been deleted. I would have deleted the president's tweets. And you know why? Because it's a bald-faced lie, it's Republicans who use absentee ballots to get out their vote.</p><p>That is traditionally been the way that Republicans have always motivated their voters. Go ahead and vote early. So I think that the social media platform companies should regulate themselves, and they should make sure that these conspiracy theories, the one the president put out about Joe Scarborough, it should be deleted. The lies need to stop. There is no First Amendment right to lie, period.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAVLICH: And with that, we will move on.</p><p>PERINO: Actually, you can.</p><p>GUTFELD: You can.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: There's no First Amendment right to lie. There is no First Amendment right to lie. You just go ahead and lie.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Today, I'm 6 feet tall. Are you going to get me arrested?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: No, but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: What would happen to politicians, Donna? If you couldn't lie, you'd have no politics.</p><p>BRAZILE: There is no First Amendment --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAVLICH: We are going to move on. OK, we are going to move on. Please do not miss Dana's interview tomorrow with Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. Check that out. Straight ahead on THE FIVE, major Coronavirus confusion after the CDC and Dr. Anthony Fauci backtracked on some key warnings. We will tell you about that, up next.</p><p>BRAZILE: The federal government is updating some key guidance on the Coronavirus. The CDC is now warning it may be possible to spread on surfaces after saying last week it wasn't. And there have been warnings about a potential second wave of COVID-19. Dr. Anthony Fauci said it may not happen. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: We often talk about the possibility of a second wave or of an outbreak when you're reopening. We don't have to accept that as inevitability, and particularly when people starting thinking about the fall. And I want people to really appreciate that. It could happen. But it is not inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRAZILE: Dana, clearly, this novel Coronavirus, which caught all of us by surprise, even many in our government, now we understand more about this virus than we did several months ago. Of course, over 100,000 of our fellow citizens have died during this period. But what do you think of the CDC updating its guidelines that they issued just a week ago?</p><p>PERINO: Well, all of us would have had a lot more information if China hadn't obscured and basically tried to prevent the rest of the world from knowing what was happening. If China had the ability -- if they had been willing to do what was right rather than to try to protect the Chinese Communist Party, we would've all had more information.</p><p>We would've had it sooner. And we might've been able to figure out a way to stop travel sooner. Figure out a way to social distance sooner. We might already be reopened. And we might not even had to shut down. So there is a lot of things that could have been known if we had the cooperation of China from early on. What I am pretty shocked at is the CDC, as an institution, has communicated terribly on this from the beginning.</p><p>And I understand that they are learning as they go, but then they shouldn't tell us things and then take it back. The example on the surfaces is a really good one. Last week, on this show, we talked about how this is great news and that this could help people get back to work sooner. Because if it doesn't spread on surfaces, that means that workplaces aren't going to have to worry as much.</p><p>And people could get back to work and be more confident that they weren't going to get the virus. How can it be, that a week later that the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, says actually it might transfer on surfaces. So yeah, we really don't know. It would be better if they just said there's a lot of things we don't know. Please keep washing your hands. Please keep social distancing.</p><p>We will get back to you as soon as we have more information. But this back- and-forth is not good for anybody.</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, Greg, do you think that the new guidelines now will stand another week from now, or should we go back to the ones we had two weeks ago?</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a good question. Fauci is like a DJ on meth. He keeps changing his tune. However, we have to understand that we are dealing with something called a novel virus. There are two elements there. Novel means new, virus means it's invisible. So it's no wonder that we're kind of flummoxed by this. If you went back a century, any horrible natural disaster, it would take weeks for the news to travel to the other parts of the country to tell you that something happened.</p><p>And then the news would kind of congeal into, like, some kind of unified mass, and you'd understand it. Today, news is like a lava lamp. You look at it. You see one shape. But if you turn around and you come back 10 minutes later, it's a different shape. It's because we really don't know. And everybody's -- the internet also kind of adds to it.</p><p>We are all learning at the same time. It's kind of interesting.</p><p>BRAZILE: Katie, what if -- what if -- you're a great communicator. What advice would you give the CDC in terms of putting out guidelines? As you all know, we rely on them to get it right. We rely on them in terms of the mass social distance and washing our hands. And now, as many states are reopening, I mean, what is the best communication strategy at this point?</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, they should definitely take Dana's advice to say that we just don't know. And there are some things that have been consistent about the guidelines they've given us that have worked throughout this process and that work for things like the flu and the common cold, and just preventing yourself from getting sick in general.</p><p>But, you know, the CDC and officials who have been putting out this guidance and definitive statements about what to do and what is true when - - and then say, well, maybe that's not so true. The problem is, is they would say, well, we're giving you what we know and we are saving people's lives from the virus, while policy has been developed both federally and at the state and local level, based on what the CDC guidelines say.</p><p>And those policies may have saved lives, but they've also ruined a lot of lives in terms of businesses being shut down, suicide hotlines being completely overrun. And so you know, it's a tough situation for any of them to be in because if you don't send a warning, then you were unprepared and there are people dying. But if you overreact, then people's lives are ruined as well.</p><p>So this idea that they've been making definitive statements that are then not true, is one that they should take moving forward and learn from it. And I think we also have to look at all the data they've been putting out, and the models that were wrong on a lot of this and all of the policies that were put in place as a result that have had some serious consequences for people all over the country.</p><p>BRAZILE: I agree with you. And lastly, Jesse, the second wave, Dr. Fauci say it's not inevitable. What do you think about this so-called second wave? Should we be worried about it?</p><p>WATTERS: Dr. Fauci, I mean, is this guy running for office because he's flip flop more than a politician? Like, this guy is supposed to be the expert. You think experts could say? I don't know. But they don't, because they're experts, and they think they know everything.</p><p>Haven't experts been taking it on the chin recently? I mean, these are the same experts that tell us global warming is going to kill us in 10 years. It's the same experts that said there's no mail fraud. Oh, actually there is. These guys don't know anything. And it's because China didn't tell us the truth, so we're trying to scramble.</p><p>But if you're an expert, you're supposed to keep the people calm and informed so they don't panic and buy toilet paper. But now, you've gone back and forth so many times, we don't believe anything you say. We don't believe -- it's like -- it's like -- and CDC is like your wife. Like, she keeps -- she keeps changing your position and acting like she's been right the whole time. Not my wife of course, but other people's wives.</p><p>GUTFELD: You're already in trouble.</p><p>BRAZILE: Oh, Jesse. Jesse, don't get into -- don't get in trouble with your wife. And look, we got -- we depend on these experts because they are saving lives.</p><p>WATTERS: No, read that line earlier.</p><p>BRAZILE: Look, ladies, growing protests in Minnesota, rightfully so, over the death of another unarmed black man in police custody. The latest next.</p><p>WATTERS: Protestors clashing with police in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was pinned down by an officer during an arrest. Floyd lost consciousness and was later pronounced dead. The video shows the encounter. I'm going to warn you, the video is disturbing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE FLOYD, PRONOUNCED DEAD AFTER POLICE ARREST: I can't breathe, officer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shut up.</p><p>FLOYD: I can't breathe. They're going to kill me, man.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Four officers involved in the arrest had been fired and the FBI is now investigating. All right, so Donna, obviously horrible situation. You want to see the police body cameras and wait for an investigation before it's over, but from what it looks like there is really no reason to jam your knee into the neck of a guy who was handcuffed. What do you think?</p><p>BRAZILE: Well Jesse, let me just say this, that this is -- this is like deja vu, similar to Eric Garner in 2014. Have we learned anything? Have we learned that police must be properly trained? Have we learned that just because you have black skin doesn't mean that you should be arrested?</p><p>Mr. George, according to all of the accounts, was a young man who grew up in Houston, Texas, went to Minnesota, went to work as a security guard because he couldn't find work in Houston. He's a father. He's someone that his co-workers called him a gentle giant.</p><p>So I want to talk about him a little bit, because so often we call them black men or black women, but not talk about their lives, the lives that are now gone forever, simply because this police officer, five minutes with his knee on his neck. This is a time for us to not just take a deep breath, each of us, but to understand that people in the black community -- I'm sure I speak for not just black people, but all people, this is not right.</p><p>And those officers, I'm glad the FBI is investigating. Those offices should be arrested. They will have their due process, of course, but they should be arrested. They are paid to protect and serve all citizens. So please, please, I hope people will protest peacefully tonight.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. And we'll follow this as it develops. Katie --yes, so do I. You know these things, it's hard to judge when you're not there, but more information is going to come out. But if someone is handcuffed on the ground, we don't know what precipitated that, we'll find out later.</p><p>But if you really feel the need to subdue this individual, you don't have to put the knee in the neck. You can put it on the back or you could just rest your foot there. I just -- it seems like a really extremely aggressive move.</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes. Look, the video footage that we have is really terrible and awful. And every one of these situations is different. And I think we need to wait for more information. But the initial footage of what we have looks really awful and terrible, and that why the officers have been fired. And if they were criminally liable, I hope that they are charged and held responsible for that.</p><p>But I do want to say, Donna, that, you know, I think there's a lot of white Americans too, who don't think that this is OK. And I hope that you know, we can all learn from the situation. But I don't think that -- you know, I think as a community and everybody looks at it, and it's a very difficult thing to watch and to stomach. So I would say that there are people who share that sentiment with you who don't necessarily share the same skin color.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Greg Gutfeld, what was your reaction when you watch the video?</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, I do think it's -- it is hard for a lot of people not to see race in this. In an ideal world, we wouldn't see race, we will just see a horrifying event. And I think that's what Katie is trying to say. What I would look at is something that isn't about race, but it's about a weird phenomenon in life. I call it the unbending mind. It's often the product of a system in which the goal cannot allow for any deviation.</p><p>There's a lot of minor examples that you come across in life. When a traffic warden is writing you a ticket, they're not going to listen to you. When you're on an automated helpline, no matter what you do, you can't get them to change. So it's a procedure and I'm talking about what is happening when we're talking about that knee jamming procedure.</p><p>So in this case, that has been taught, and it's enforced. And it's unbending in the sense that no matter what a bystander was saying, the anguish of the man on the ground is completely ignored because it's an unbending mind. It's the product of a system that cannot change and that cannot deviate.</p><p>And whenever you see something like that, it's never going to go right. It's never going to go right. Every system has to have a way out. Every system has to allow you to adjust and change what you're going to do IF you see it going the wrong way. I mean, this was a horrible event that could have been stopped if somebody listened. But they were involved in a unbending procedure that didn't allow them.</p><p>And true to what -- and what you guys were saying, we don't know what happened before. Was he resisting arrest? Is there going to be more tape that we're going to see? I think you can look at this and be horrified, at the same time curious about what happened before.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: Well, and when I heard Donna say was that she was speaking not just for African Americans but for all people, and I think that's -- no matter who you are, if you have a heart and you're watching this, and as you said, every time we show the video we have to say warning, it's tough, and it is a very tough video to watch.</p><p>What I think is interesting is you know, for a long time we've had African Americans try to explain what it is like to feel like they are targeted by police. And we have a lot of Facebook -- excuse me, iPhone or cellphone video now that we never had in decades before. So imagine if that had existed before.</p><p>I think that the fact that we have this technology now might actually help us get past this because it is pretty sad that on a day when we're -- you know, we've made so much progress as a human race, and also here in America, look at this ingenuity that we have with this great space rocket that's going to go into orbit, and yet we still have problems like this happening with police with a non-violent offender, who is saying that he can't breathe and there's four officers who, as Greg was saying, like they're not listening as if they don't care.</p><p>And I don't know if even -- I don't -- whatever happened before, it didn't mean that he should have this result that he should have died because of it. He was subdued. He was on the ground.</p><p>BRAZILE: He called out his mama.</p><p>PERINO: He has his handcuffs. What else is he going to do to them?</p><p>BRAZILE: He called out his mom before he died.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, very tragic situation.</p><p>BRAZILE: And he said, sir. He said, sir. He called out his mom and he said, sir, before he died. Those were his dying last words. He called out his mom, and he said, sir. Remember that.</p><p>WATTERS: It's very sad. All right, we will. More fallout over a viral video showing a racially charged confrontation over leashing a dog. What do you see this?</p><p>GUTFELD: By now, you've seen the video of that Central Park lady who when asked by a birdwatcher to leash her dog, called the cops on him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm going to tell them there's an African-American man threatening my life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please tell them whatever you like.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There's an African American man right here in Central Park. He's recording me and threatening myself and my dog. I'm sorry, I can't hear that. I've been threatened by a man into the ramble. Please send the cops immediately.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: That poor dog. She seemed fixated by race. You could say that's part of ID-ing someone to the police, but it sounded more like she was using it to gin up a false allegation. Along with horrible manhandling her poor dog, she became the prime example of what people call a Karen, a person quick to complain to the manager, the dope who makes a scene about nothing, and not much of a dog owner.</p><p>It backfired. She lost her job and her dog. Is there any sense of satisfaction to be found in this? Maybe. She seems the type who no doubt has dished out the grief she's getting now. And her mistake isn't small if this hadn't been filmed. The black man could have been arrested. She could have lied some more shots could have been fired. Instead, the phone saved him and ruined her.</p><p>So is this damage proportional? She is a jerk and oddball and maybe even a bigot. But she apologized profusely. So why not forgive her? Because that's what the birdwatcher did of her apology. He said, \"if it's genuine, and if she plans on keeping her dog on a leash in the ramble going forward, then we have no issues with each other.\"</p><p>Now, that's not bad. If he can do it, so can you. And if you don't, then you're kind of being a Karen too, a judgmental person embracing outrage because it feels good. So don't be a bully. Be the birdwatcher, and remember, we all have bad days. Lucky for us, a lot of them never get filmed.</p><p>Jesse, everybody knows a Karen. Sometimes people even are Karens. Are you a Karen sometimes?</p><p>WATTERS: I'm not going to answer that stupid question. I will tell you this. I'm not crazy about either of these people. Number one, the guy's a bird watcher. I mean, how many birdwatchers are in prison right now? Probably zero. They're the most peaceful people in the world, OK. She didn't need to do that. I guess she shouldn't have played the race card and called 911. Just leash your dog and get out of there.</p><p>But he, he didn't have to post it on the internet and ruin her life. And apparently, he was like trying to lure the dog was Scooby snacks to like teach her a lesson or something like that. I think they should have a beer summit and just shut up about this.</p><p>GUTFELD: I -- actually, I disagree. Katie, I think that he did the right thing. He had to post it because she was going to -- she could have framed him. And also, he actually kind of forgave her because he knows her life is getting ruined. I mean, I got to give him credit.</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, we should all be more like him. I think her behavior was absolutely disgusting. She was the one who was breaking the rules. And in general, I hate when people who break the rules and you say something to them, then they act like you're the problem. And that's exactly what she did here.</p><p>But then she upped the ante by being racist about it, and calling the police even though she was the one who was in the wrong, and it was obvious because there were signs posted everywhere. So it's unfortunate that she has faced consequences for this, but her behavior and the situation -- and as you said, she could have said a whole lot of things about what was going on. He wasn't threatening her. He was just saying, hey, could you put your dog on a leash and follow the rules.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. You know, Donna, so here's the big question in my mind. She did an awful thing. She's lost her job and her dog and her reputation. Does she just -- if she's not given a second chance after an apology, then what can she do? Aren't we there to give second chances?</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, look, I think Mr. Cooper has been quite gracious. He reminded me of the folks at Mother Emmanuel who forgave the man who came in and shot and killed, you know, nine people. So there's no question that, yes, you can forgive. That is written. That is something that we all believe as many of us who are Christian that you forgive.</p><p>But here's the biggest story. We do live in an extraordinary time and moment. And when she, you know, call 911 with that voice, an African American man, maybe we should just remind her that so many African American men and women have been murdered and killed simply because they exist.</p><p>So I hope people learn something from this and that we're not talking about it two, three days from now. And no, we should not threaten her life. And no, she should be able to say I'm sorry and get back to work at some point.</p><p>GUTFELD: Dana, his name is Christian so he could do something very Christian. Well, I bet you were disgusted by the way the dog was handled.</p><p>PERINO: Well, I think that if -- here's what I would say to all dog owners. I know it's tempting and I've done too. You let your dog off the leash because you want to let them have some freedom. If she had just put the dog on the leash. She wouldn't have been -- have been holding it by the collar. She could have walked away, she would still have her job, she would still have her dog. And now the dog doesn't have as a mom either, so it's a terrible situation all around.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. All right, \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next.</p><p>PERINO: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" Greg?</p><p>GUTFELD: It's time to be fast. It's time to be really fast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: All right, here's the dog just hanging out. And oh, damn, he gets surprised. He's having a great time with his owner, and then, what's that over there? A cats. Look at that. Look at it. You can't beat that. One more time and then I'm going to stop. I could watch this every day for the rest of my life. What a face.</p><p>PERINO: He is super cute. All right, Jesse.</p><p>GUTFELD: Super.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, so speaking of animals, there is a bear with the expensive taste. A bear tried to break into a Mercedes Benz in the woods in North Carolina. Watch this.</p><p>GUTFELD: A lot of screaming.</p><p>WATTERS: Look at him back away from the car like he got busted.</p><p>GUTFELD: Jesse, only you do laughing at that.</p><p>PERINO: All right. We'll have to do the other --</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020052701cb258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600V-7121-DXH2-6003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6338\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health Care</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Deaths</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pharmaceuticals</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CDC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George Floyd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Central Park</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CDC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George Floyd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Central Park</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Torts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Control &amp;

This year GDPR became more than a &amp;#x2018;buzzword&amp;#x2019;. Last month, the first hefty fine was issued to Google by French regulators for failing to comply. As a result, discussion around data privacy and protection has echoed across the globe in all sections of business and society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What&amp;#x2019;s more, due to lots of very public data breaches, consumers are now more aware than ever of just how much data they produce &amp;#x2013; and why they should care about its protection.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>GDPR is now enshrined in EU law and there is no &amp;#x201C;getting around it&amp;#x201D; &amp;#x2013; uncompliant organisations will be held accountable. We are entering a new era of data awareness.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Cisco backs US GDPR calls<br/>Satya Nadella calls for global GDPR<br/>GDPR and the case for ethical data handling</p><p>Data regulation calls for collaboration &amp;#xA0;</p><p>When we surveyed UK companies in April 2018, 56% said that their company&amp;#x2019;s reputation would suffer as an impact of non-compliance with GDPR. At the time, 47% were concerned about revenue loss, and 41% thought their company survival was at stake due to potential financial penalties. We can now see that these concerns around the implications of GDPR for business united the C-suite and IT decision makers. &amp;#xA0;</p><p>As predicted, the number of data breach notifications has significantly increased. The Information Commissioner&amp;#x2019;s Office (ICO) reported 367 data breach notifications in April 2018. However, between July and September it highlighted a total of 4,056 notifications. This is a huge increase. &amp;#xA0;Far from highlighting flaws in the system, it reflects a fresh, cautionary approach that makes it less likely for a breach to slip through the net &amp;#x2013; it means those compliance processes are working. &amp;#xA0;</p><p>Businesses are trying. &amp;#xA0;They are grappling with the logistics of data privacy communication. Consumers, on the other hand, are now having to deal with clunky and often irritating online pop-ups, alerting us to our right to &amp;#x2018;opt-out&amp;#x2019;. &amp;#xA0;</p><p>GDPR getting it right, making it better</p><p>This only makes the reputational risks of non-compliance more significant. Big tech firms are paying attention, as the US toys with the creation of a similar regulation. GDPR compliance boils down to competitive advantage &amp;#x2013; those that want to thrive, not simply survive, in the data-driven world must put consumer data privacy first.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>The survey we conducted six months ago found that three in four UK businesses believed GDPR would improve their competitiveness. With increasingly data-savvy consumers, they weren&amp;#x2019;t wrong. The major data breaches that have been making headlines, build into this narrative. Consumers now perceive data breaches with more clarity. They are awake when it comes to data privacy and more aware of their data rights.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Handling this through the adequate management and protection of data wherever it lives, on-premises or in the cloud, is now of the utmost importance for companies.</p><p>&lt;figure&gt;</p><p>&lt;figcaption&gt;</p><p>Image Credit: TheDigitalArtist / Pixabay</p><p>&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; Google you have been GDPR&amp;#x2019;d</p><p>Google is the first tech goliath to incur a major&amp;#xA0;GDPR fine, since the regulation came into play in May 2018. Its decision to appeal the ruling of the French data watchdog CNIL, which maintains that Google failed to attain adequate consent from users when processing their data for the purpose of personalised advertising, will be watched closely by Big Tech players. As the first challenge to the EU regulation, it will set a precedence for content creators, publishers and tech companies alike.</p><p>What makes Google&amp;#x2019;s case interesting is that it will help to clarify what transparent communication looks like &amp;#x2013; and ultimately, consensual opt-in. Google claims it has followed regulatory guidance and user testing measures to create the best experience, but ultimately users were presented with catch-all tick boxes. The signal is clear, there can be no vague interpretations of what transparent consent looks like.</p><p>Risks and data mapping</p><p>Ultimately, explicit consent is essential regardless of perceived risks of losing consumers with increased interactivity. Upfront interaction should be regarded in a positive light. It means building a better relationship with customers, based on trust and understanding. Meanwhile, a business cannot empower users with transparent data privacy opt-ins, if they do not understand how their data is shared.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>The pressure is on to pursue highlighted breaches, rigorously targeting blatant transgressions and to bring to light what isn&amp;#x2019;t permissible. This is only the beginning, we cannot work complacently with a box ticking mentality. Consumers, businesses and technologists must keep a visionary eye on the middle-distance, staying one step ahead of regulatory needs. &amp;#xA0;</p><p>Grant Caley, CTO at NetApp</p><p>This is everything you need to know about GDPR<br/>Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/232/814/22/154946431347.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/232/814/22/154946431347.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/232/814/80/154946431405.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/232/814/80/154946431405.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBREAK-136924228</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBREAK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC5-MHJ1-JDJN-64C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TBREAK MEDIA Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

We first use in-sample data of Facebook's stock prices between 2017/1/1 and 2018/6/30 to build rules and then employ those rules to forecast its out-of-sample data between 2018/7/1 and 2018/12/31.

Introduction</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><anchor id=\"ref50100\"/>Event study methods examine certain occurrences that result in abnormal returns (<link><marker>Li &amp; Tallman, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference50100\"/></link>) and have been used extensively in the financial and economics literature. However, they typically just confirm if an event has caused an abnormal change in stock prices or excess returns of an affected company. This study thus proposes a new event study approach that advances the analysis to the level of a forecast, which can greatly enhance the resultant value of an event study.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><anchor id=\"ref50135\"/>The present literature uses abnormal returns (ARs), calculated based on a stock's expected return, to check if they are caused by any specific event. The mean adjusted returns model utilizes the average of stock returns over an estimation period to represent the expected return, but it does not consider the relative performances of the individual stock and the market. Conversely, the market model uses linear regression to find the parameters for calculating the expected return. However, a single linear regression may not be able to represent complicated stock behaviors (<link><marker>Woodside, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference50135\"/></link>), much less current methods that only are able to pinpoint a single event.</p><p>This study therefore presents a new event study method that considers two criteria for abnormal returns (and events). First, we take an extremely high (or low) daily stock return as an abnormal return to forecast events. Second, if the daily stock return does not reach the above-mentioned level, then we use relative performance (i.e., ratio between the daily stock return and the daily market return) to identify the abnormal return. Hence, we are determining the thresholds for both criteria.</p><p>To achieve better forecasting ability, this study separates the data into in-sample and out-of-sample datasets. The former covers \"known\" data, allowing us to determine the thresholds and to build rules during the estimation period. We then use those rules to forecast the out-of-sample data, which are \"unknown\". The new method is able to forecast multiple events during an event period.</p><p>Because the new method relies on \"known\" data to build the rules, the selection of a target company becomes critical. In other words, we need to find one that has enough events to facilitate our analysis. Social media companies offer a good direction, because they recently have been involved in a number of data breach occurrences. Among the various social media companies, we pick Facebook as our study target for a couple of reasons. First, Facebook is one of the largest social media companies listed on NASDAQ, and second its data and relevant events are publicly accessible.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the applications of current event study methods. Section 3 introduces the current methods, this study's new method, and the data. Section 4 shows how to build rules from an estimation and then to utilize those rules to forecast events in the out-of-sample data. Section 5 discusses the empirical results. Section 6 summarizes this paper and provides some directions for future research.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.

Data</emphasis></h><p>To demonstrate how the new method works, we target to find a company with numerous news events. This study picks Facebook as our study target for a few reasons. It receives a lot of media coverage, including controversies such as user privacy, user addiction, etc. Facebook is also a listed company with publicly available data and is also one of the largest social media companies in the world. Hence, its relevant events are very open to the public.</p><p>This study uses the closing prices of Facebook (target company) and closing levels of NASDAQ (market) as the data for analysis. The in-sample data cover between 2017/1/1 and 2018/6/30 (3/4 of all the data), while the out-of-sample data are those between 2018/7/1 and 2018/12/31 (1/4 of all the data).</p><p>To validate the analysis, this study defines \"event\" as news appearing on Cable News Network (CNN). As of September 2018, it has more than 90 million television households as subscribers. We need to judge if the characteristic of the news is either positive, neutral, or negative. Facebook has recently suffered from data breach events, and so we might be able to tell whether the related news is negative to its stock price.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.

Discussion</emphasis></h><p>The contribution of event study methods is to particularly forecast the rise or fall of stock prices due to certain events. Our event study method uses events (news) during the estimation period and the in-sample data to determine the thresholds and to build the rules based on the thresholds. We then use the rules to forecast the multiple events in the event period.</p><p>Rule 1 aims to check if  is greater than the positive thresholds or lower than the negative thresholds. For example, the 's of Cases 1 and 4 are lower than the thresholds, meaning both have extremely negative returns. By Rule 1b, we can proceed to claim that both relate to negative events.</p><p>Rule 2 picks up possible events when  is not extremely high or low. It checks for relative performance. As an example, the 's of cases 3 and 5 are not extremely low, and so we move to Rule 2. Because both 's are higher than the threshold for relative performance and both have negative 's, we can claim that both match negative events.</p><p>Our new method is different from current methods in the literature in many perspectives. First, the new method uses daily stock return and relative performance as the criteria. Second, the new method uses in-sample data to obtain the thresholds and to build the rules. Third, the rules obtained from estimation are then used for forecasting. Next, the rules are very company dependent, as we need to calculate , , and  for each company. Lastly, the new method can forecast multiple events.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. Conclusion and future study</emphasis></h><p>It is very interesting and beneficial to know if the stock price of an individual company correlates to any events. This study proposes a new approach to overcome the limitations of current event study methods in the literature by separating the data into groups of in-sample and out-of-sample. In-sample data help build the rules in the estimation period. These rules then allow us to forecast the out-of-sample data in the event period. This study takes Facebook as the study target, because it is a leading company in the social media industry and its related data and news are relatively easy to access. The empirical analysis shows that the new method successfully forecasts the events.</p><p>The rules built by the new method are company dependent, and thus each company has to build its own rules. Thresholds can be considered as the abnormal returns. Furthermore, the new method can also forecast multiple events during the forecasting period and is different from current methods. First, it uses daily stock return and relative performance as the criteria. Second, it employs in-sample data to obtain the thresholds and to build the rules. The rules obtained from estimation are very company dependent and can be used for forecasting. In addition, the new method can forecast multiple events.</p><p>Future studies should be able to apply the new event study method to other listed companies for further validation. Additional analysis can also be conducted based on companies from different industries in order to examine for any variances when applying the new method.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Funding</emphasis></h><p>This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 107-2410-H-141-014-], Taiwan, ROC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: \u204e Corresponding author.</p></bodyText></contact><graphic/><bibliography><bodyText><p><anchor id=\"reference50005\"/><link><marker>Berman et al., 2000</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref50005\"/></link> G.

It's continuing to advance, of course, but I completely agree with Peter Thiel that technology progress is not inevitable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you mean by that?</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recall Margaret Mead's story of mariner tribes that once made their living building streamlined canoes to catch fish in huge volumes. Over time, they just forgot how to make the canoes. When Mead found them, they were sitting on the beaches looking at the oceans with no idea that canoes were the solution to their food shortage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But in our day, learning is stored forever on billions of devices. It's not going to disappear.</emphasis></p><p>We're actually at risk of this kind of amnesia. We forget the real entrepreneurial sources of creativity and progress: invention, summed up in technological progress. It's not good to have most of the stock market advance [coming from] five companies, which buy back their own stock and buy up the shares of their rivals. I'm talking about Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How does big tech's success hurt innovation?</emphasis></p><p>Their success does not represent some fundamental change in technology. It reflects, rather, a vast enlargement of government regulations, rules that really favor big companies. It reflects their capability of lobbying and lawyering and litigating and finding a path through the mazes of rules.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Your next book is called Life After Google. Why that title?</emphasis></p><p>I'm convinced the Google paradigm of massive data centers and artificial-intelligence determinism will be transcended in the next era.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Replaced by ... ?</emphasis></p><p>I'll refer you to Gordon Bell's law: Every ten years, the rate of progress predicted by Moore's Law produces a hundredfold rise in computer cost effectiveness. Which then requires a completely new computer architecture.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Your point being that we're now past the ten-year point of Bell's Law and the cloud.</emphasis></p><p>And lo and behold, a new architecture is arising. It will solve the increasing concentration problem of the internet, which is porous security. It will be millions of small data centers around the world, many of them mobile, all using cryptography and a new computer architecture based on blockchains and other inventions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why would Google not see this?</emphasis></p><p>Google is trapped by its own illusion. The advances in machine learning that Google trumpets and preens about are really just advances in the speed of processing. When their Go-playing computer can play more Go games in a minute than the whole human race has played through all history, that's not a great advance in intelligence. It's the same intelligence just accelerated to terahertz speeds. And this creates this illusion for Google and others that machine learning can somehow gain consciousness and usurp humans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Artificial intelligence evokes both excitement and fear. Elon Musk, for one, is fearful.</emphasis></p><p>Musk is a tremendous entrepreneur and a quite stale thinker. When he starts pretending that he's an ethical visionary, that human life is just a simulation in a smarter species' game ...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A rather demoralizing view of humanity.</emphasis></p><p>It's really nuts. It's clinically crazy. Silicon Valley should stop trying to make human beings obsolete and figure out how to make them more productive again. </p><p>GEORGE GILDER SPOKE WITH RICH KARLGAARD, OUR EDITOR-AT-LARGE AND GLOBAL FUTURIST.

I cover technology and economics for The New York Times, and I'm this week's tour guide through recent tech news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  One of the big stories of the year has been the Big Tech companies becoming targets of major antitrust investigations by the nation's federal enforcement agencies, Congress and states. The concern is not only the companies' market power but also how they handle personal data, spread disinformation and amplify partisan divisions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  To someone who has covered technology and antitrust for The Times for more than two decades, this period seems different than anything I've seen before. To me, it raises a question: Are we entering a new, progressive era in antitrust?</p><p>  The answer to that question matters a lot. The official scrutiny of the big tech companies -- Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple -- is just getting underway. Whether it results in meaningful curbs on the companies will depend in good part on the persistence of the investigators.</p><p>  Investigations have a way of finding things. And the institutional commitment to antitrust, or lack of it, will be shaped by economics, ideas, politics and public opinion.</p><p>  There are intriguing parallels with the progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th century: growing gaps in wealth, concentration of markets and a perceived threat to democracy.</p><p>  Then, the technology engine was the industrial revolution. Today, it is the digital revolution. Then, the targets of enforcement were the industrial trusts, led by Standard Oil. Today, it is the digital behemoths. Then, the policy response was new antitrust laws -- the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914 -- and aggressive enforcement. Today, the policy response remains to be seen.</p><p>  While reporting recent stories and a few interviews last week, I've been struck by two things: the very different climate now compared with the one surrounding the antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, and the extent of the bipartisan support for pursuing the big tech companies.</p><p>  The Microsoft investigation and trial, which I covered, was fairly narrowly focused. It was about market dominance and the software giant's tactics to stifle innovation.</p><p>  The second half of the 1990s, when the Justice Department and a group of states investigated and then filed a major antitrust suit against Microsoft, were banner years economically. It was not only a period of strong overall growth but a time when productivity rose. For a few years, income gaps narrowed.</p><p>Microsoft was a purely economic case. ''But now we're seeing an evolution in antitrust, to take in greater social and political concerns, as well as economics,'' said Maurice Stucke, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law. ''Antitrust is starting to capture the public imagination in a way that Microsoft never did.''</p><p>  Current antitrust thinking is expanding to take in matters like the control of data and privacy. Since the 1980s, a central focus of antitrust has been a dominant company's power to increase prices. But there is a lively debate now about so-called nonprice components of competition. A loss of privacy to a data-harvesting giant like Facebook or Google, for example, can be cast as reducing the quality of the service and thus as a signal of monopoly power.</p><p>  ''Nothing's free,'' Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said at the Times's DealBook conference last month. ''If consumers think they're getting any service for free, they're being misled.''</p><p>  Data, Mr. Delrahim explained, is an asset for internet companies, and gathering and analyzing large amounts of personal data is not necessarily a problem. But digital data, he added, ''can give you market power. And its abuse would be a violation of antitrust law.''</p><p>  In the last couple of weeks, Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, who is the ranking minority member of the House Judiciary Committee, has been a fixture on cable TV news as a hyperventilating, partisan opponent of impeachment. But in an interview last month for an article on a Judiciary subcommittee's antitrust investigation of the big tech companies, Mr. Collins was a voice of bipartisan reason.</p><p>  Mr. Collins is less critical of the tech giants than the Democrat leading the inquiry, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island. And he dismisses the calls to break up the companies from the Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.</p><p>  But Mr. Collins supports the House investigation. And he thinks that consumers should be given greater control over how the tech giants use their data and that the companies should be prevented from buying up nascent competitors. ''Those are genuine concerns of mine,'' he said.</p><p>  Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group, points to the states' investigation of Google, joined by 50 attorneys general and led by Ken Paxton, a conservative Republican attorney general in Texas, as a sign of the changing times in antitrust. An investigation of Facebook, led by Letitia James, the attorney general of New York and a Democrat, has nearly as many supporting states.</p><p>  ''The environment is radically different than it was even a year or two ago,'' Mr. Lynn said. ''It's a grass-roots rebellion against concentrated power.''</p><p>  But whether shifting sentiments will translate to a pendulum swing in antitrust, reminiscent of the progressive era of a century ago, is uncertain at best. Major enforcement actions would be challenged in court. For years, the courts have generally embraced the ''consumer welfare'' standard -- typically, though not always, dependent on higher prices. The courts have also been guided by the assumption that markets are self-correcting.</p><p>  ''I think antitrust should move, but it will really take the alignment of a lot of stars to move this ship,'' said Andrew Gavil, a law professor at Howard University.</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p/><p>  Voices of the decade.

She gives the example of the coffee shop owner who had all the information she needed to run her business at her fingertips. There would be an intuitive dashboard that not only helps her run her coffee shop but makes financial decisions and takes the pain out of managing business finances. </p><p>Some recent conversations and articles I have read have convinced me that we are well on the way to that rosy picture of the future. And it mainly comes down to data. Fintech is getting better at gathering and analyzing data then presenting it in useful ways. Lenders are approving loans more quickly and many now have such a rich history of their own data as well as hundreds of connections to other data sources that a much more complete picture of the financial health of a business is possible. Not only that but many of these lenders are real platforms with deep insight into their small business customers. According to deBanked[3] the five largest online small business lenders in 2018 were (in order) PayPal, OnDeck, Kabbage, Square Capital and Amazon. For three of these companies lending is just a side business, something they offer as part of their broader platform. Many small businesses use PayPal, Square or Amazon as the platform on which they operate their business. So, these big tech companies have insight into the day to day revenue fluctuations of their small business customers.The Accounting Software Companies Lead the WayWho are not on this list (yet) are the accounting software companies like Intuit, Xero, Netsuite and Freshbooks. I would argue that these companies have even better insight into small business than the likes of PayPal, Square or Amazon. They see everything both on the revenue and expense side as well as the cash flow and balance sheet. Not only that, when you have large market share you see the connections between companies and you can notice problems in real time. Intuit launched Quickbooks Capital[4] just a couple of years ago so they really haven't scaled their lending business yet. But this is a company I am keeping a very close eye on. Because Quickbooks has such a large market share of the small business accounting market they have data on most small businesses and are therefore uniquely positioned to not just make accurate credit decisions but to provide real intelligence to the small business owner. I was speaking recently to a former executive at Xero, the New Zealand-based accounting software provider and Quickbooks competitor that is starting to ramp up business in this country. She said that in Australia Xero had insight into 90% of small businesses there. When you have data on the vast majority of the small business population you can make very accurate predictions on things like cash flow. Xero would see 75% more data than the largest Australian banks meaning they were best positioned to provide the all-encompassing financial dashboard for small businesses. Where are the banks? It is true that large banks also have great network effects and therefore vast troves of data. They could also be the financial hub for small business owners but as yet we have seen few moves by banks into creating the kind of financial tools that others are creating. They have regulatory considerations and also have their hands full trying to innovate on their existing products.Embedded Financial Services is the FutureAnother group of companies to watch are those that focus on one particular vertical. They can build out capabilities unique to a particular industry and while they won't have broad data sets they can go very deep within a vertical. Shopify is a good example of this as they become the go to platform for ecommerce companies. They have functionality they call Shopify Manage which is billed as 'the mission control for your business, wherever you go' available on desktop or mobile. They also have Shopify Capital for lending and Shopify Payments. There are many other verticals where one company is building out the ecosystem for the industry. Toast is doing it for restaurants, MindBody is doing it for the wellness sector, Housecall Pro for home service companies. These companies have the potential to embed financial services in their offerings and become the hub of the ecosystem for their vertical. Speaking of embedding financial services Square added something really interesting last year. They launched Square Installments[5] allowing their small business customers to offer financing to their customers. Suddenly any small business can offer financing and it is all embedded in the software they are using to process customer transactions. Any small business can become, in essence, a lender. I have not mentioned Stripe yet. What Square has done for the physical world Stripe has done for the online world, enabling any small business to accept payments online. In doing so they have become the most valuable Silicon Valley startup in history. They have recently announced moves into lending and credit cards so they are a company to watch in this space. We shouldn't count out the Kabbages and OnDecks of the world. They have been leaders in technology innovation for the past decade and are well positioned to create deeper relationships with their customers. Kabbage, for one, has already announced a movement into payments and they have their Kabbage Greenhouse, a custom-built resource for small business owners.We are Just Getting StartedIt an exciting time to be involved in fintech as new ecosystems are being built before our eyes. But we are not there yet. On the journey towards small business utopia we are probably only in the second or possibly the third inning. But all the pieces are being put into place. All the companies mention here offer API connections that enable real time data that can provide deep insights into the health of a business. Over the long term the world's biggest lenders should be those that have access to the most data and can analyze it most intelligently. Banks may end up providing the bulk of the capital here but it is the new tech companies that I am watching most closely. They are the ones most likely to fulfill Mills' vision of small business utopia. The post A New Small Business Tech Ecosystem is Emerging[6] appeared first on Lend Academy[7].

The survey reports that while Snapchat was the favorite social platform, Instagram beat out Snapchat in monthly users among Gen Zers. Despite these numbers, Snapchat's number of daily active users is continuing to fall, and has been long-surpassed by Instagram[3]. Even as Snapchat's user base continues to shrink, it's still cited among teens as their favorite platform, according to a new survey of Gen Zers. </p><p>Of the 8,000 teens surveyed[4] by investment firm Piper Jaffray, 41% named Snapchat as their favorite social platform. But Snapchat's lead as the favorite social platform is down 5% from Piper Jaffray's previous survey done in Fall 2018. Even though Snapchat is still No. 1 as the favorite, more of the teens surveyed use Instagram (84%) more regularly than Snapchat (81%). Instagram is only a few percentage points behind Snapchat as teens' favorite social platform, and Snapchat's lead continues to shrink with each Piper Jaffray biannual survey. The growth of Instagram among teens mirrors Instagram's dominance over Snapchat overall. While Snapchat's number of daily active users has shrunk down to 186 million[5], Instagram's user base is continuing to grow, and has surpassed 500 million[6]. Instagram has also become the place where teens prefer to engage with brands. Instagram recently bet big in this area by adding in-app shopping[7], a sect that some analysts have said could generate $10 billion in revenue[8] by 2021. Read more:Instagram's big bet on shopping could be worth $10 billion in 2021[9] The survey also asked teens about their favorite influencers on various platforms. On Instagram, these included Kylie Jenner and James Charles, who have 131 million and 15.2 million followers, respectively, and are influential in the beauty world. Piper Jaffray found that 80% of female teens are using online influencers as a starting point to discover new beauty trends, so it's easy to see how Instagram has become such a major part of teens' time spent online. The survey spelled bad news for Instagram's parent company, Facebook, however. The site's popularity among teens is continuing to dwindle, with only 36% of teens reporting that they use Facebook at least once per month, compared with 52% who said they use it monthly back in fall 2016. Twitter and Pinterest were also in the ranks, but way behind Instagram and Snapchat. The report shows that 44% of teens said they use Twitter at least once per month, while only a quarter of those surveyed say they use Pinterest.NOW WATCH: What's going on with Jeff Bezos and

There's more direct streaming from the likes of HBO and Netflix, more services like Apple TV and Amazon Fire, and more innovative devices from Roku boxes to wall-size smart TVs with cross-platform search.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are in the midst of a revolution - one that is allowing television and video to serve the multicultural world that is the America we celebrate. And it has birthed new and diverse voices like my network, Crossings TV, which offers hyper-local programming in six different languages in markets throughout the United States, serving communities that are too often shut out or overlooked.</p><p>Yet worrisome new federal regulations proposed by Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler, with the support of large technology companies such as Google, have thrown a dark cloud over this revolution - one that could deprive many communities of the tailored, in-language program options we have worked so hard to provide.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Big Tech 'Poachers'</emphasis></p><p>Under the FCC's proposed new rules (known commonly as \"AllVid\" after an earlier industry lobbying effort the Obama administration rejected in 2010), big technology companies such as Google would be given the right to poach the program license deals we negotiate with pay TV providers like DirecTV or Time Warner Cable without being bound to the underlying license terms that help fund our networks and ensure they get enough exposure to thrive.</p><p>The FCC chairman says the rule is intended to create competition for set-top box devices. He argues that exempting these companies from the obligation to negotiate for rights will enable them to focus on developing new boxes to repackage your existing programming and place it alongside the more underfunded Internet video in a single \"cross-platform\" search.</p><p>It's an odd argument on behalf of competition - asking the federal government to subsidize the most wealthy companies so that they can bring more search and advertising services into our living rooms and require yet another in-home box.</p><p>Leaving aside that the rationale for this giveaway to Big Tech is totally undermined by the fact that smart TVs and other home gateways already provide crossplatform search, there is an even more compelling reason to oppose the AllVid mandate: It will likely bring us less diversity, not more, in television's golden age.</p><p>Today, small and niche networks like mine can negotiate for channel placement they think will help them be seen by their target audience and can cross-promote with other networks to gain exposure from potential fans.</p><p>Crossings TV has grown because it has been able to create meaningful local programming in partnership with locally based multichannel distributors - builders of infrastructure and creators of jobs who are physically on the ground in the communities we serve.</p><p>But the Wheeler \"AllVid\" rule directly attacks that crucial system and allows tech firms to disregard negotiated terms such as channel placement, digital rights and much else.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">At the Box's Mercy</emphasis></p><p>Further, the cross-search function leaves our channels all at the mercy of the new box's often-mysterious algorithms - notorious for burying disfavored and smaller companies in its ash heap. The dedicated viewers who value networks like Crossings TV have no currency with Google, its fellow Silicon Valley technology inhabitants or profit-maximizing cross-platform search algorithms. Certainly many have observed that the Google workforce looks nothing like the diverse communities it purports to serve. For programmers like Crossings, these giant new boxes could mean a one-way ticket to the back of the bus.</p><p>While working to create an African-American focused search browser through Blackbirdhome.com, I saw this problem up close when the Google search algorithm consistently buried African-American-generated content on the lowest rung of search results. Extrapolating that experience to a world of television that is subservient to a Google universal search master box promises a continued outlier existence for African-Americans and Asians, as well as other minorities.</p><p>AllVid will further strip-mine our value and harm viewers by serving up new banner ads (for which creators will get no compensation), ignoring privacy protections for your personal television viewing habits, and driving up bills with the massive re-engineering needed to accommodate these privileged devices.</p><p>The FCC should step back. Promoting competition is a goal we all share, but the government putting a thumb on the scale in favor of technology giants so that they can sell more ads, track our viewing habits and bury diversity programming - all in the name of competition that already exists - hardly seems to be part of the progressive legacy this FCC should leave.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCHNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCHNWS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JH1-65K1-JBPF-92SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241792</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Multichannel News</publicationName><volume>Vol. XXXVII</volume><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>April 11, 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002H12</classCode><className>TIME WARNER CABLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

HODA KOTB (07:02:10): Hey, everybody. Welcome to TODAY. So happy you`re joining us on this Thursday morning. Savannah, good to see you, too.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, co-host (07:02:18): Good to see you, Hoda. And we do have a busy morning. So much happening, including the long-awaited return of the NBA. The first official games, as you said, inside the bubble. They`ll tip- off tonight. We`re going to have more on that just ahead.</p><p>HODA KOTB (07:02:29): Oh, lot of people excited for that. Also, it`s going to be a very emotional day in Atlanta. Congressman John Lewis will be laid to rest, a final tribute to the remarkable life of the civil rights icon. We`re going to have a full report on that, Savannah, just ahead from Atlanta.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:02:45): All right. But let`s begin this morning with the coronavirus. The pandemic has reached new highs in this country. Nearly four and a half million cases and more than one hundred fifty-two thousand deaths now.</p><p>HODA KOTB (07:02:56): Meantime, starting this morning, masks will now be mandatory on the House floor and in all House office buildings on Capitol Hill. The move comes after a Texas congressman tested positive.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:03:10): And back to sports for a moment, Major League Baseball is now updating its policies after the Miami Marlins outbreak. According to a report from ESPN, players will be encouraged not to leave hotels except for games. And every team is now going to travel with a compliance officer who will ensure the league`s safety policies are actually being followed.</p><p>HODA KOTB (07:03:29): In a moment, we`re going to speak with a member of the coronavirus task force FDA commissioner, Doctor Stephen Hahn. But first, NBC`s Tom Costello starts us off. Hey, Tom, good morning.</p><p>TOM COSTELLO (07:03:40): Hoda, good morning. This headline just crossing, Johnson &amp; Johnson, a drug-- another drug maker, says its vaccine candidate also appears to be effective against COVID-19 in pre-clinical trials. Meanwhile, nearly a thousand people are dying every single day. This morning, the nation`s chief infectious disease officer is suggesting specifically that we need to be looking at the death toll, the effectiveness of masks, and he`s talking about that debunked video that the President pushed and that was pulled from social media this week.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>TOM COSTELLO (07:04:12): The situation this morning in the three most populated states is described as dire. California, Texas and Florida each marking record high average daily deaths this week. In hard-hit L.A. County, some on the frontlines are demanding better staffing and more protection. Now, a medical association that represents nearly two hundred medical schools in the U.S. and Canada is warning that without urgent action, the death toll could skyrocket well into the multiple hundreds of thousands. Among the group`s proposals, increasing the availability and accessibility of testing, and establishing a nationwide standard for face coverings. The group also recommends national criteria for K-12 school re- openings. Education secretary Betsy DeVos says how schools reopen must be decided at the local level.</p><p>BETSY DEVOS (07:05:02): There is not a national superintendent nor should there be. Therefore, there`s not a national plan for reopening. TOM COSTELLO (07:05:10): It comes as a new study is looking at long-term side effects of COVID-19. A survey of more than fifteen hundred so-called Long Haulers reveals dozens of symptoms that persist weeks or even months after patients recover, including fatigue, body aches and difficulty concentrating.</p><p>BETH MOORE (Coronavirus Survivor) (07:05:28): I feel like I`m still in this kind of mental fog.</p><p>TOM COSTELLO (07:05:31): And as drug companies search for treatment options and work to develop a vaccine, Doctor Anthony Fauci is warning about a widely shared video, even shared by President Trump, in which doctors touted hydroxychloroquine, a drug the FDA has cautioned against using to treat the coronavirus.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI (07:05:49): The only recourse you have is to be very, very clear in presenting the scientific data that essentially contradicts that.</p><p>TOM COSTELLO (07:05:58): Meanwhile, another member of Congress has tested positive, Republican Louie Gohmert of Texas, often seen without a mask. Without basis, he blamed the facial coverings for his diagnosis.</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (07:06:09): When I have a mask on, I`m-- I`m moving it to make it comfortable. And I can`t help but wonder if that, you know, puts some germs in the mask.</p><p>(End VT) TOM COSTELLO (07:06:21): Mister Gohmert says that he does not have any symptoms right now. Meanwhile, speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has now issued an order everybody in the House, including staff and members of Congress, now must wear a face covering. Hoda, back to you.</p><p>HODA KOTB (07:06:33): And, Tom, Doctor Fauci spoke about something else, he also spoke about the importance of not only wearing the mask, but maybe even eye protection, like goggles or a shield.</p><p>TOM COSTELLO (07:06:41): Yeah. Yeah, you know, a lot of people have these. I have them with me all the time in case I`m in a specific environment in which maybe I need the eye protection, certainly on a plane or in a-- in an airport. Doctor Fauci addressed the effectiveness of goggles.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI (ABC News) (07:06:57): Theoretically, you should protect all the mucosal surfaces. So if you have goggles or an eye face-- or an eye shield, you should use it. I mean, it`s not universally recommended, but if you really want to be complete, you should probably use it if you can.</p><p>TOM COSTELLO (07:07:14): Yeah, to be clear, he`s not talking about having it at the house or necessarily when you`re out walking the dog but rather when you`re in an environment, same thing with face shields in an environment with a lot of people. It may be a good idea, but really those face shields are best for medical professionals, hospital workers, paramedics and the like. Hoda.</p><p>HODA KOTB (07:07:32): All right, Tom Costello for us. Tom, thank you. Savannah.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:07:36): And that brings us to Doctor Stephen Hahn. He`s the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, and a member of the government`s coronavirus task force. Commissioner, good morning, sir.</p><p>DR. STEPHEN HAHN (FDA Commissioner) (07:07:47): Good morning, Savannah. Thank you for having me on the show today.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:07:51): You`re welcome. You know, I know the FDA has some developments to share this morning. I do want to do the big picture first. We have a hundred fifty-two thousand deaths in this country. The average daily rate of deaths is now over a thousand, hasn`t been that since early June. And then you had that association of medical colleges releasing a report saying if the nation does not change its course and soon, deaths in the U.S. could be well into the multiple hundreds of thousands. Do you agree with that assessment?</p><p>DR. STEPHEN HAHN (07:08:21): Well, this is a serious situation. And my assessment is that we have to take this seriously. This virus is still with us. We`ve seen some evidence that the very common sense public health measures that we can take, wearing a mask, following local guidance with respect to wearing a mask, social distancing, hand hygiene, protecting the vulnerable, we`ve seen early evidence that that works. We must take this seriously and we must do that because we absolutely need to reduce the number of cases in the country, because that is what`s leading to the deaths that we`re seeing. SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:08:55): You know, I was going to ask you this later, but, I mean, since you brought it up, and I`ve heard interviews from you, you`ve been preaching that gospel, saying, \"Please wear a mask,\" for many, many weeks now. You know that Congressman Louie Gohmert, who is a mask critic, has contracted COVID-19. And now he`s suggested that maybe it`s the mask that actually caused it. He said, \"I can`t help but think if I`d been wearing a mask so much in the last ten days, I wonder if I would have gotten it. Moving the mask around, getting it, sitting just right, I am bound to have put some virus on the mask that I sucked in.\" Do you think that is a likely scenario? Do masks cause COVID-19?</p><p>DR. STEPHEN HAHN (07:09:34): We don`t have any medical evidence that that`s the case. I heard the clip with Representative Gohmert and I`ve heard from family and friends. There`s lots of people who have questions about the masks. What our data show is that people should wear masks, particularly when they can`t socially distance. And they should follow their local ordinances with respect to masks. That`s something that, you`re right, we`ve been talking about for weeks and months, and I think should be continued the message that the American people hear.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:10:01): Is it frustrating when you have a sitting congressman who has COVID-19 say something like that?</p><p>DR. STEPHEN HAHN (07:10:08): Well, I think getting the message out is the most important thing here, Savannah. We just need to be consistent in what we`re saying these common sense measures to the American people. And I will continue to do that to make sure that people understand that we have the power. We have the power as the American people to-- to slow the spread of this virus. We`ve seen this virus spread in the U.S., but we`ve also seen it around the world. So we know it`s with us. We have to take this seriously.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:10:37): Let`s talk about vaccines. There are reports, actually an FDA official said that there could be a vaccine approved for emergency use in a matter of weeks. Is that correct? How soon?</p><p>DR. STEPHEN HAHN (07:10:50): Well, Savannah, I said before, I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner. And I didn`t have a crystal ball then and I don`t have a crystal ball now. We do have a number, now two, phase three trials that have started. And this is, of course, in record time from identification of the virus to a phase three trial. Now that phase three trial is going to provide us the data to actually determine whether a vaccine is safe and effective. We`ve seen a number, I mean, a huge number of Americans who signed up as potential volunteers for these trials, and that`s great news. And that will help us accelerate the development, will help the developers. But FDA`s role in this is to provide assistance to those developers, but we`re going to call the balls and strikes on this. And one thing I want to tell you and your viewers, Savannah, is that we will not cut corners. We will use our very high standards of safety and effectiveness. We`ll look at those data and we`ll make a determination based upon those high standards. We have terrific scientists and people at FDA and I know and I`m confident that we`ll do that job on behalf of the American people.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:11:54): I know you don`t have a crystal ball, but real quickly before I leave it, the President said last night there will be a vaccine before the end of the year. He said maybe sooner. I know anything is possible, but would you consider it to be a strong likelihood that we could have a vaccine ready to be distributed by the end of the year?</p><p>DR. STEPHEN HAHN (07:12:13): All I can say at this point is it`s possible. Things have been moving very quickly. I know our team is looking at data in real time from these trials, and that should help us expedite this. But the most important message, I think, Savannah, is we`re not going to cut corners on this. We`re going to look at those data and make the right decision for the American people.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:12:32): Before I let you go, I have to ask you about hydroxychloroquine. It`s in the news once again. The President retweeted a video promoting it. He even said, \"I took it for a fourteen-day period, and I`m here. I don`t think you lose anything by doing it.\" The vice president said yesterday, \"Many Americans have had positive experiences with hydroxychloroquine.\" But the FDA actually revoked emergency authorization for the drug because it wasn`t effective and it wasn`t safe. It was potentially dangerous. So once and for all, should people be taking hydroxychloroquine?</p><p>DR. STEPHEN HAHN (07:13:07): So just to be clear, we revoked a EUA, an emergency use authorization, at the request of another government agency BARDA. And this was for drug that was authorized for use in sick hospitalized patients. We had data that when this drug was combined with others, there were some risks associated with that. But the decision that the question you`re asking me is a decision between a doctor and a patient. A doctor and a patient needs to assess the data that`s out there. FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. And that in the privacy of a doctor/patient relationship is where that decision should be made.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:13:43): Are you concerned at all about misinformation about this drug in particular?</p><p>DR. STEPHEN HAHN (07:13:50): I am-- I am-- what I`m concerned about is that FDA provide all the information about the side effects, the potential side effects as well as the efficacy. As you know, these drugs have been approved for a number of years for other indications by the FDA. We`re know-- we know that they`re safe in those settings. But we want to make sure that the right information is out to providers so that they can make this decision with patients.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:14:13): Doctor Hahn, yes, you have your hands full and we appreciate your work. Thank you so much. Thanks for your time this morning, too.</p><p>DR. STEPHEN HAHN (07:14:22): Thank you, Savannah. Have a great day.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:14:24): You, too.</p><p>(07:14:25): All right. Hoda, seven-fourteen, I`ll send it to you.</p><p>HODA KOTB (07:14:27): All right. Thank you. Craig joins the table now. A closely watched hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday, Craig.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBCNEW-2020073001cb501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBCNEW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HM-5J41-DXH2-61XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157446</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2678\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020  ASC Services II Media, LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved<br/></copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 National Broadcasting Co.

Here's some of the things we may be talking about today. Trump World spent the weekend on a full-bore media offensive[1] in an attempt to gaslight people after Ukrainium One blew up in their faces. Trump went nuclear on social media, declaring impeachment \"unlawful,\" demanding House Intel Committee Chair Rep. </p><p>Adam Schiff be investigated for \"treason,\" and regurgitating Fox News talking heads 22 times[2] saying his impeachment would lead to \"civil war.\" Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham went on Face the Nation[3] to say he had \"zero problems\" with Trump's phone fuckery, and Stephen Miller scuttled out of his dungeon[4] to get humiliated on Fox News[5] by Chris Wallace when he dodged a bunch of questions and tried to assert Trump was the REAL whistleblower. Rep. Jim Jordan went on CNN[6] and got fact-checked by Jake Tapper. The actor Jon Voight shitposted[7] a video declaring \"war,\" and last night Trump posted a video[8] whining about fighting for his Front Row Joes. This morning Trump shitposted that Rep. Adam Schiff should be tried for treason for investigating him. 'Cause that's how treason works. [Face the Nation[9] / Fox News Sunday[10] / State Of The Union[11]]For the umpteenth time in a week, very sober Rudy Giuliani went on TV[12] to yell and scream a bunch of nonsense. Rudy continued pointing fingers at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker[13] (who quit-fired himself[14] this weekend!) about his involvement in Ukrainium One. Shortly after the appearance, Joe Biden's campaign sent out a letter to a bunch of reporters and media outlets demanding they stop putting Giuliani on TV[15] to \"introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\" In a related story, on Friday Giuliani canceled a paid gig[16] to Armenia where he was scheduled to speak at a pro-Kremlin conference for the second year in a row AFTER the Washington Post reported the trip. [Transcript[17] / Video[18]]The AP gossips that Bill Barr was \"surprised and angry\"[19] to learn Trump was throwing him and Rudy Giuliani under the same exploding Ukrainium One bus. The New York Times writes that Trump was \"repeatedly warned by his own staff\"[20] that Ukrainium One was \"completely debunked,\" and that Trump is increasingly reliant on crazy people who, like Rudy Giuliani, \"feed Trump all kinds of garbage.\" Tom Bossert, Trump's former Homeland Security advisor, surfaced over the weekend to tell George Stephanopoulos he was \"deeply disturbed\"[21] Trump ALLEGEDLY tried to blackmail a foreign government for \"dirt on a political opponent,\" later adding he wasn't sure if it was actually an abuse of power. In another rare rebuke, Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger tweeted[22] Trump's civil war comment was \"beyond repugnant.\" [This Week with George Stephanopoulos[23]] On 60 Minutes, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the administration didn't really give House Democrats much of a choice[24] in launching an impeachment investigation seeing as how he admitted to blackmailing the Ukrainians for congressionally approved foreign aid to fight Russia's invasion of Crimea. As expected, House Minority Leader Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy responded by vomiting up the White House talking points[25] -- almost verbatim -- and then had the balls to deny that he'd ever seen the talking points the White House accidentally sent out. McCarthy then went on social media to shitpost the talking points he claimed he hadn't seen. Also he lied about everything else. [60 Minutes Transcript[26]] The AFP has a great infographic[27] laying out the events leading up to the impeachment inquiry, while Buzzfeed has a flow chart[28] showing what could happen next.  Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks has an open letter to the mystery Trump loyalist[29] who penned that dumbass Dear, #Merica letter last year attempting to reassure the world that there were adults in the Oval Office.The USDA can't release a bunch of nearly complete research reports[30] because 80 percent of the employees at the USDA's Economic Research Service have been quit-fired. The Hill notes 141 people have left the agency, and only 16 have opted to follow the agency as it moves to Kansas City, Missouri. Some of the reports include important ag data on food stamps in rural economies, health insurance in farming households, honeybees, and the opioid epidemic. Elizabeth Warren is going directly for old eyeballs in early primary states with a $4.7 million ad buy.[31] Recent polling shows Warren gaining ground[32] in a number of early primary states like Nevada and South Carolina.  Ireland has paid Trump \u20ac100,000[33] to feed the local cops forced to protect him while he farts around his Doonbeg golf course. In an attempt to salvage his image, disgraced former British Prime Minister David Cameron says allowing the Brexit referendum was his greatest failure.[34] In an appearance on Fareed Zakaria GPS, Cameron said he supported Vice President Joe Biden pressuring Ukraine's former president, Petro Poroshenko, to tackle Ukraine's historically corrupt government, adding that Western nations exerted similar pressure on Poreshenko[35] over concerns about Russian fuckery in Crimea. [Fareed Zakaria GPS[36]]Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman emerged[37] from his lavish hidey hole and denied to 60 Minutes that he ordered the murder of political dissidents, including Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for saying mean things about his bloody, iron-fisted rule. Coincidentally, a new PBS Frontline documentary 'splains how MBS gaslights and bullshits people[38] into supporting his autocratic schemes. [Frontline[39] / 60 Minutes Transcript[40]] [embedded content] O'Donnell presses MBS: \"How could you not know\" about the murder? <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com\">www.youtube.com</url>[41] Thousands of Russians took to the streets[42] to demand the release of protesters arrested during this summer's Moscow City election protests. The continued public show of force by anti-Putin activists coupled with opposition candidates winning almost half the seats in the Moscow City Council suggests that protesters exploited \"a chink in the establishment's armor and [are] achieving [their] goal of becoming a coherent threat\" to Putin's regime.The looming privacy fights in big tech are underway as major retailers race against time to come into compliance with a new California tech privacy law.[43] The landmark law scares the bejesus out of corporate lawyers since it could provide a model for looming debates over a possible federal privacy law. The Washington Post adds that things may get worse for data brokers with the revelation of a new privacy initiative aimed at California's 2020 ballot.[44] Rebecca Traister has a piece this morning that looks back at people who came out of the shadows[45] to tell their #MeToo stories, and asks, \"Was it worth it?\"You've got ONE DAY left to get your name stenciled on a computer chip[46] that will be placed on the 2020 Mars rover. Over 10 million people have signed up so far, and the US has the third most signatories, behind Turkey and India. USA, USA, USA!John Oliver 'splained compounding pharmacies[47] and how mixing and matching meds for specific patients, like wounded warriors or birds, is ridiculously expensive and STUPID dangerous since there really aren't any regulations.

In a recent interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Harris pointed to Facebook's business model as a cause of polarization and extremism in our society. A combination of antitrust regulation and employee action should be used in order to \"slay the duck,\" Harris argues. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] To one of the foremost activists for a more \"humane\" internet, Facebook has become a monster. </p><p>\"It is a monster they can't control, and that's what we should be talking about,\" Tristan Harris, director and cofounder of the Center for Humane Technology, said in an interview with Business Insider at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this week. \"They built a Frankenstein and there's no easy way, with the DNA that it has, to make it a safe monster,\" Harris said. Facebook's effect on society is just one part of the problem, Harris argues. The spirit of Facebook \u2014 the \"move fast and break things\" mentality \u2014 has skewed what's acceptable across the industry. Harris described it as a race to the bottom, where companies have started to use \"less ethical, more extreme, more lizard-brain-level access\" in search of more human attention. Facebook's business model has becomeinfectious to other tech companies, he argued. It \"jumps into their skin and animates them.\" The problem is pervasive, Harris said. And since this business model has become the foundation for the industry as a whole, it can't be easily changed without destroying something fundamental. \"Once you have a duck, you can't turn a duck into a chicken when the DNA has already been baked,\" Harris said. Harris went as far as to suggest that the only ways to fix a company like Facebook would be to break it up, through methods like antitrust legislation, or to completely remove the leadership making the decisions, like Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg. Gradual change may not be possible, he said, especially given their financial incentives of continuing to prioritize growth. \"I think people have to ask, 'Do you trust these particular human beings to make quick changes this far down the line after this many apologies?'\" Harris said. Harris previously worked for Google as a design ethicist before leaving the company and becoming an outspoken advocate for ethical technology. These days, his organization has a mission[2] to \"reverse 'human downgrading' and realign technology with humanity\" through methods like encouraging tech workers to drive change in their organizations and pushing lawmakers to regulate the \"attention economy.\" Harris said that Facebook's culture and business model were responsible for producing polarization and extremism in our society. He pointed to a 2019 study[3] by researchers from Northeastern University, University of Southern California, and the nonprofit Upturn that found that left-leaning political ads targeted at a left-leaning audience go further than ads that reach across the aisle. \"You start getting more polarization just through the natural operation of the business model,\" Harris said. \"So fundamentally, even if you solve the fake news, et cetera, you still get polarization-for-profit as the designer of the business model.\" Facebook's business has been under a microscope for the past several years, for everything from its mishandling of user data,[4] to hate speech and disinformation[5] on the platform, to Russian agents using Facebook[6] to influence the 2016 election, to the company's decision not to fact-check political ads[7]. The result has been intense scrutiny of Facebook's power, not just in the tech sector, but nationally and globally as well. In the view of advocates like Harris, the company has become an uncontrollable beast. Facebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Slaying the duckSo, how do we fix the problem? \"Slay the duck,\" Harris said, citing antitrust regulation. Using antitrust regulation to curb tech companies' power has become a talking point among several Democratic presidential candidates, most notably Sen. Elizabeth Warren. In leaked audio published by The Verge[8], Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that a Warren presidency would \"suck\" for the company, as Warren has made breaking up big tech part of her campaign platform[9], and has described companies like Facebook and Amazon as monopolies. Antitrust laws would curb some of Facebook's control, Harris said. \"The issue is about power,\" he said. \"If you want to change their behavior, you have to have power to do so. And if they have totalizing power and asymmetric manipulation of the entire political environment \u2014 including dollars, they can out-spend any activist or nonprofit businesses \u2014 you can't compete with that level of power.\" While applying these laws to the tech sector would be effective, Harris argues that there might be a stronger action society could take, one that places the power in the hands of employees: recruitment. \"They're seeing it harder and harder to recruit and retain the best employees, and that's actually one of the strongest, most immediate forms of pressure, faster than regulation \u2014 the fact that they can't hire and retain the best employees,\" Harris said. Harris said it's a focus of his organization \u2014 building awareness of these issues in a way that engineers can understand in hopes it creates a \"culture of responsibility\" among the Silicon Valley talent pool. \"It's not just that we have this minor addiction problem or we have these bad apples, a few bots ... a few bad fake news stories,\" Harris said. \"People have to understand the gravity of the problem.\"NOW WATCH: Most maps of Louisiana aren't entirely right.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   BioFollow   PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 In a congressional race where an acolyte of Roger Stone who\u2019s been banned by Twitter and Facebook may not even be the most unconventional candidate, voters in the Republican primary for Florida\u2019s 21st Congressional District have a rich array of choices.   The six people competing in the Aug. 18 primary include a former burlesque dancer and wild animal exhibitor who did business in the same circles as \u201cTiger King\u201d Joe Exotic; a Palm Beach neighbor of Mar-a-Lago who is supported by QAnon believers; and Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator and anti-Islam activist who calls herself \u201cthe most banned woman on the Internet\u201d and who once handcuffed herself to the front door of Twitter\u2019s office in New York.   There\u2019s also an ex-cop, a nuclear engineer-turned college professor and a retired investigator for the IRS.   AD   AD   Among the constituents they hope to represent: the president and first lady. The Trumps registered as Republicans in Palm Beach County in October when President Trump changed his official domicile from Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach. They both voted by mail in the March presidential primary.   All six candidates are political newcomers running in a heavily Democratic district that covers Palm Beach, West Palm Beach and parts of Broward County. One of them will face Lois Frankel, a Democrat who ran unopposed two years ago, or her primary opponent, Guido Weiss, a former legislative assistant for Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii).   Regardless of their long shot chances of winning the congressional seat in the fall, the GOP candidates are being scrutinized due to Trump\u2019s decision last year to call the district home.   AD   AD   Loomer\u2019s campaign manager is Karen Giorno, who was a senior political adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016. She said the president\u2019s team wants the congressional seat \u2014 which Frankel has held since 2013 \u2014 to go red.   \u201cI have a very cordial and very active relationship with the Trump campaign for reelection. It was a directive not from the president, but on behalf of the president, he wanted this district flipped,\u201d Giorno said. \u201cThat\u2019s his home district. He deserves to have someone represent him, not impeach him.\u201d   The White House declined to comment on who the president supports in the race. But earlier this year, he retweeted a post promoting Loomer\u2019s candidacy.   AD   Voters here are now trying to sort through the crowded field.   \u201cYou\u2019ve got a couple there that are a little loony tunes, at least on the surface anyway,\u201d said voter Rhona Hayes, 71, of her choices in the Republican primary. \u201cBut I\u2019m looking beyond that. There are some good candidates too.\u201d   AD   Hayes and her husband Charles, 85, retirees who live in Boynton Beach, said they\u2019re most impressed with Aaron Scanlan, a former police officer and Air Force veteran.   \u201cYou\u2019ve got some unusual candidates here,\u201d said Charles Hayes, a retired firefighter.   Scanlan currently has the lowest amount of cash on hand \u2014 $1,863 out of the $91,285 he raised \u2014 and said his plans for fundraising were crimped by the pandemic. He\u2019s trying to reach voters just like Hayes and her husband.   AD   \u201cThis is my first time in politics, and I\u2019m just trying to get my name out there,\u201d said Scanlan, who is now a Realtor.   Loomer, 27, is the front-runner in fundraising. She\u2019s raised $1,161,622 and spent $924,059. Her donors include Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who, like Loomer, has also been banned from Twitter and other platforms.   AD   While most of her fellow candidates address Florida-specific issues, such as clean waterways, Loomer focuses on topics such as Big Tech. She has been a no-show at most of the forums and debates sponsored by community organizations in the district where voters get to know the candidates.   She did appear at the annual Lobsterfest, sponsored by the Republican Party of Palm Beach County on Aug. 9, where she was endorsed by Roger Stone and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), both Trump allies. She said those endorsements, along with support from Fox News host Jeanine Pirro and other marquee names in the Republican Party, help to make her the front-runner.   AD   \u201cIt\u2019s laughable to think that President Trump would consider, or even look, or waste his time considering any of these other candidates, because they\u2019re just not viable,\u201d Loomer said. \u201cThey\u2019re not Trumpian.\u201d   AD   Loomer, who is from Arizona but went to college in Miami at Barry University, said she\u2019s lived in Florida for nearly three years and considers herself a Floridian. She said she wants to replace Lois Frankel because, among other things, Frankel supports Black Lives Matter.   Candidate Reba Sherrill is part of Trump\u2019s \u201cbridge family,\u201d the fans who show up at the bridge near Mar-a-Lago to wave to Trump\u2019s motorcade when he\u2019s in town. She\u2019s also Trump\u2019s neighbor on Palm Beach and a familiar sight on Ocean Drive.   AD   \u201cEvery day I roll my wheelchair numerous times in front of Mar-a-Lago and pause and salute the flag,\u201d Sherrill said \u2014 referring to the large American flag Trump has on his property.   Sherrill, a health and wellness consultant, is self-funding her campaign. She donated $350,102 to the effort.   Sherill is supported by people who promote QAnon, identified by the FBI as a group with \u201canti-government, identity-based and fringe political conspiracy theories\u201d that may motivate violent extremists. Sherill\u2019s main issue in the campaign is fighting child trafficking, which matches with QAnon theories that rampant pedophilia rings have infiltrated the United States.   Sherill said she worries about a \u201cnew world order\u201d and globalism as well as sex trafficking.   AD   AD   \u201cI felt like I really didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Sherrill said about running for Congress. \u201cIt's my civic duty. The country is a mess right now.\u201d   Elizabeth Felton said she\u2019s running to protect property rights. She owns a business called Safari Bob\u2019s, which offers field trips and \u201cencounters\u201d with wild animals such as foxes and ring tailed lemurs. She said regulations pushed by animal rights groups infringe on citizens.   \u201cProperty rights are personal rights,\u201d Felton said. \u201cThe mainstream media treats you like a lunatic if you want to own a pet monkey.\u201d   She worked as an exotic dancer at a club in New York for 10 years before her move to Florida because as a single mother, she needed a job with a flexible schedule.   AD   Felton\u2019s is running on other issues: term limits \u2014 \u201csix years, and then you\u2019re out,\u201d and support of the legalization of marijuana the federal level and LGBTQ rights.   AD   She acknowledges that the slate of candidates is an interesting one. She and four of her opponents \u2014 but not Loomer \u2014 call each other often and are cordial and agree on most issues, she said, including their support for Trump.   \u201cMost of us get along,\u201d Felton said. \u201cPut us all together, we\u2019re almost the perfect candidate.\u201d   Felton said she and fellow candidate Michael Vilardi talk on the phone almost daily. Vilardi owns a tax business, and was a criminal investigator with the IRS. Vilardi, who has raised the lowest amount of money in the race \u2014 $56,494 \u2014 said he\u2019s running to change the rules for Social Security recipients.   \u201cLet\u2019s start with Social Security,\u201d Vilardi said. \u201cThese old people are getting robbed.\u201d   He said he\u2019d push for a change in tax laws that he thinks are unfair to the elderly. He also supports term limits.   AD   While Loomer has garnered big-name endorsements from the far-right, Christian Acosta, the sixth candidate in the field, has some Trump-adjacent support as well. Acosta is a former nuclear engineer who now teaches at Palm Beach State College. Toni Holt Kramer hosted a fundraising dinner for Acosta at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach in February. Kramer is one of the founders of the Trumpettes, a group of Trump super fans that throws a gala at Mar-a-Lago every year for the president.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42856465588</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M4-Y0D1-JCSC-J1Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1394\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The big tech companies have assembled large teams of lobbyists to make their case.</p><p> The venting from their critics goes well beyond Silicon Valley. When the FTC asked for comments in 2018 on whether the modern economy required a new approach to consumer protection and competition, the commission received more than 750 letters, many targeting the tech companies.</p><p> The Retail Industry Leaders Association, the lobbying group that represents Walmart, Target, Home Depot and other major retailers, complained that the internet was now at the center of consumers' decision-making and \"controlled by a relatively small number of highly influential firms.\"</p><p> Sixteen advocacy groups and think tanks jointly wrote a manifesto that argued for tough antitrust enforcement against the tech giants, accusing them of a wide variety of misbehavior, including mishandling people's data, crippling small retailers or causing internet addiction.</p><p> And Handpulled Noodle, echoing complaints from other small businesses, told the FTC that Google sold ads on its listing in search results. The ads direct customers to delivery apps that charge steep fees and cut into the restaurant's already thin profit margins.</p><p> \"As a small business, it's like David versus Goliath,\" said Andrew Ding, owner of Handpulled Noodle. The shop's Google listing is how most customers find his restaurant, yet, he said, he has no control over how his business is represented. There is no way for him to get rid of the ad next to the Google listing.</p><p> \"Google is it,\" Ding said. \"I would love for small business owners that don't have the clout or the influence to have more say about how their business is represented.\"</p><p>Google said it allowed companies to place ads next to the listings of other businesses to give users more options.</p><p> The Justice Department is examining complaints against Google and Apple, while the FTC will handle antitrust issues related to Facebook and Amazon. Last week, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust also announced plans for an investigation into whether the tech companies stifled competition and hurt consumers. The first hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.</p><p> In Europe, officials have been far tougher on the four tech giants. They have imposed about $9.3 billion in fines against Google in three separate antitrust cases since 2017. They concluded that Google had forced phone makers to pre-install its apps, favored its own services over rivals in search results and imposed unfair terms on companies that use its search services.</p><p>Oracle and Yelp have also taken their complaints to Europe. Ken Glueck, Oracle's executive vice president and policy chief, said that Google's dominance of the market underpinning online ads had enabled it to stifle competition, including from Oracle.</p><p> \"We'd like to be bigger. But when you have one party who dominates the space and is acting with exclusionary conduct, that affects the market,\" Glueck said.</p><p> There is a bit of a revenge backstory to Oracle's complaints about Google: The two companies have been locked in a nine-year patent battle with billions of dollars at stake.</p><p> Yelp contends that Google favors its own services over rivals in search results in both Europe and the United States, even when the Google content is lower quality or less relevant. Google has said it tries to give people quick answers to their questions instead of sending them to another site.</p><p> In 2013, the FTC closed an investigation into Google's search practices after the company agreed to some narrow changes.</p><p> \"For so many years, U.S. companies were having to seek relief abroad because our own enforcement agencies weren't critically examining the questionable behavior of large firms like Google,\" Yelp's Lowe said.</p><p> The European Commission also opened an investigation of Amazon in September and has received informal complaints from eBay and the European e-commerce site Zalando, according to a person involved in the discussions who was not authorized to disclose them.</p><p> A central argument against the tech giants is that other companies must use their services because that's where their customers are. With that leverage, the argument goes, the tech giants force terms on other companies that are unfair and deepen their dominant positions.</p><p>Apple makes developers use its App Store to distribute their apps on iPhones and collects up to 30% of revenue made through activity inside the app. Spotify recently argued to European competition authorities that Apple used its App Store to punish Spotify's app and favor Apple's competing service.</p><p>Apple has said that it welcomes competition and that it has long helped Spotify reach customers. The only time it has requested changes to Spotify's app is when it \"tried to sidestep the same rules that every other app follows,\" Apple said in a statement in March. Spotify had directed customers to pay it directly so Apple wouldn't get a cut.</p><p> News publishers rely on Google and Facebook to send readers their way. But publishers say that to appear high on those sites, they are encouraged by both companies to use technologies that make Google and Facebook, instead of the news sites themselves, destinations for news. Google and Facebook also dominate the digital-advertising market, the publishers say, squeezing one of their main revenue streams.</p><p>Google and Facebook said they competed for ad dollars with a wide range of online and offline services, including television, radio, newspapers and billboards. Both said their technologies helped news publishers increase ad revenue.</p><p>Google in recent years dropped an effective requirement for publishers to make their news free via Google search results, and introduced a program to help news sites increase subscriptions.</p><p> A Facebook spokeswoman said the company is working on products and training to help news outlets make more money from their articles on Facebook and had committed $300 million in the next three years to support local news.</p><p> Musicians say they must put their songs on YouTube, which is owned by Google, to reach fans, but YouTube pays below-market royalty rates. \"Hopefully, these investigations drive real change to make sure fans, songwriters and artists all get a fair shake,\" said Rosanne Cash, the singer-songwriter who is co-chairwoman of the Artist Rights Alliance, an advocacy group for musicians and songwriters.</p><p>Google has said YouTube helps artists reach new audiences and get paid, at the same royalty rates as Spotify.</p><p> Jack Nicas and Karen Weise are New York Times writers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-6ffac29f1aec6c46ab562222218d7d075b41756</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-YRC1-JBCN-42PH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

But when you have one party who dominates the space and is acting with exclusionary conduct, that affects the market,\u201d Mr. Glueck said.</p><p>There is a bit of a revenge back story to Oracle\u2019s complaints about Google: The two companies have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17169064/federal-circuit-oracle-v-google-third-trial-java-android\">locked in a nine-year legal battle</url> with billions of dollars at stake.</p><p>Yelp contends that Google favors its own services over rivals in search results in both Europe and the United States, even when the Google content is lower quality or less relevant. Google has said it tries to give people quick answers to their questions instead of sending them to another site.</p><p>In 2013, the F.T.C. closed an investigation into Google\u2019s search practices after the company agreed to some narrow changes.</p><p>\u201cFor so many years, U.S. companies were having to seek relief abroad because our own enforcement agencies weren\u2019t critically examining the questionable behavior of large firms like Google,\u201d Yelp\u2019s Mr. Lowe said.</p><p>The European Commission also opened an investigation of Amazon last September and has received informal complaints from eBay and the European e-commerce site Zalando, according to a person involved in the discussions who was not authorized to disclose them.</p><p>A central argument against the tech giants is that other companies must use their platforms because that\u2019s where their customers are. With that leverage, the argument goes, the tech giants force terms on other companies that are unfair and deepen their dominant positions.</p><p>Apple makes developers use its App Store to distribute their apps on iPhones and collects up to 30 percent of revenue made through activity inside the app. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/business/spotify-apple-complaint.html\">Spotify recently argued</url> to European competition authorities that Apple used its App Store to punish Spotify\u2019s app and favor Apple\u2019s competing service.</p><p>Apple has said that it welcomes competition and that it has long helped Spotify reach customers. The only time it has requested changes to Spotify\u2019s app is when it \u201ctried to sidestep the same rules that every other app follows,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/addressing-spotifys-claims/\">Apple said</url> in a statement in March. Spotify had directed customers to pay it directly so Apple wouldn\u2019t get a cut.</p><p>News publishers rely on Google and Facebook to send readers their way. But publishers say that to appear high on those sites, they are encouraged by both companies to use technologies that make Google and Facebook, instead of the news sites themselves, destinations for news. Google and Facebook also dominate the digital-advertising market, the publishers say, squeezing one of their main revenue streams.</p><p>Google and Facebook said they competed for ad dollars with a wide range of online and offline platforms, including television, radio, newspapers and billboards. Both said their technologies helped news publishers increase ad revenue.</p><p>Google in recent years dropped an effective requirement for publishers to make their news free via Google search results, and introduced a program to help news sites increase subscriptions.</p><p>A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was working on products and training to help news outlets make more money from their articles on Facebook and had committed $300 million in the next three years to support local news.</p><p>Musicians say they must put their songs on YouTube, which is owned by Google, to reach fans, but YouTube pays below-market royalty rates. \u201cHopefully, these investigations drive real change to make sure fans, songwriters and artists all get a fair shake,\u201d said Rosanne Cash, the singer-songwriter who is co-chairwoman of the Artist Rights Alliance, an advocacy group for musicians and songwriters.</p><p>Google has said YouTube helps artists reach new audiences and get paid, at the same royalty rates as Spotify.</p><p>Some companies that sell goods on Amazon have argued that they have to be on its site to reach customers. Yet they fret that Amazon can use data about their sales to develop its own competing products. The trade group for major shoe brands, including Nike, Crocs and Dr. Martens, asked the F.T.C. to look into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/public-comments/2018/08/20/comment-ftc-2018-0048-d-0067\">the \u201cdual role\u201d of platforms</url> like Amazon.</p><p>An Amazon executive, Jeff Wilke, said at an event last week that those in-house brands were \u201ca tiny fraction\u201d of Amazon sales. \u201cWe do not allow anyone inside Amazon to have access to individual sellers\u2019 data in order to build a private-label product,\u201d he said.</p><p>A Senate hearing last month offered a preview of the potential drama to come in Washington.</p><p>Brian O\u2019Kelley, founder of an ad-technology company called AppNexus, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/O'Kelley%20Testimony.pdf\">testified</url> that in 2008 he invented an automated bidding system for advertisers that \u201cturned every ad on the internet into a real-time auction.\u201d AppNexus grew to 600 employees.</p><p>\u201cGoogle\u2019s response to the threat from AppNexus was that of a classic monopolist,\u201d he said. Google told AppNexus clients that they would need to also use Google\u2019s ad technology if they wanted to serve ads on YouTube, he testified.</p><p>AppNexus\u2019s business slumped, and it laid off 100 employees in 2016. <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.att.com/story/2018/att_appnexus.html\">AT&amp;amp;T bought it</url> last year.</p><p> Follow Jack Nicas and Karen Weise on Twitter: @jacknicas and @KYWeise.

The other is a small Harlem spot that serves Chinese comfort food and is known for its tasty dumplings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But they both say Google is unfairly hurting their businesses, and they have a new audience in Washington eager to hear about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After years of showing little interest, Congress and regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department plan to scrutinize the power, influence and market dominance of Google, as well as fellow tech giants Amazon, Apple and Facebook.</p><p>\"Obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly,\" President Trump said about large tech companies in an interview on CNBC on Monday.</p><p>Scores of other tech companies and critics, as varied as software firms and shoemakers or musicians and newspapers, have stewed for years over how, they say, some of the biggest tech firms have used their power and scale to bully them and upend their businesses.</p><p>The government is listening.</p><p>\"We're in the moment where regulators hang a shingle and say, 'We're open,'\" said Luther Lowe, the policy chief at the reviews site Yelp and the loudest antitrust antagonist against Google. \"The dozens of companies who have been quietly venting in Silicon Valley can begin to form a single-file line around the D.O.J.\"</p><p>Google, Apple and the other tech giants have pushed back vigorously against the idea that they act anticompetitively. They say that they compete with a broad array of firms - not just online companies - and that their services enable the growth of many small and large businesses. The big tech companies have assembled large teams of lobbyists to make their case.</p><p>But when the F.T.C. asked for comments last year on whether the modern economy required a new approach to consumer protection and competition, the commission received more than 750 letters, many targeting the tech companies.</p><p>The Retail Industry Leaders Association, the lobbying group that represents Walmart, Target, Home Depot and other major retailers, complained that the internet was now at the center of consumers' decision-making and \"controlled by a relatively small number of highly influential firms.\"</p><p>Sixteen advocacy groups and think tanks jointly wrote a manifesto that argued for tough antitrust enforcement against the tech giants, accusing them of a wide variety of misbehavior, including mishandling people's data, crippling small retailers or causing internet addiction.</p><p>And the Handpulled Noodle, echoing complaints from other small businesses, told the F.T.C. that Google sold ads on its listing in search results. The ads direct customers to delivery apps that charge steep fees and cut into the restaurant's already thin profit margins.</p><p>\"As a small business, it's like David versus Goliath,\" said Andrew Ding, the owner of the Handpulled Noodle. The shop's Google listing is how most customers find his restaurant, yet, he said, he has no control over how his business is represented. There is no way for him to get rid of the ad next to the Google listing.</p><p>\"Google is it,\" Mr. Ding said in an interview. \"I would love for small business owners that don't have the clout or the influence to have more say about how their business is represented.\"</p><p>Google said it allowed companies to place ads next to the listings of other businesses to give users more options.</p><p>The Justice Department is examining complaints against Google and Apple, while the F.T.C. will handle antitrust issues related to Facebook and Amazon. Last week, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust also announced plans for an investigation into whether the tech companies stifled competition and hurt consumers. The first hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.</p><p>In Europe, the authorities have been far tougher on the four tech giants. They have imposed about $9.3 billion (8.2 billion euros) in fines against Google in three separate antitrust cases since 2017. They concluded that Google had forced phone makers to preinstall its apps, favored its own services over rivals in search results and imposed unfair terms on companies that use its search services.</p><p>In his interview on Monday on CNBC, Mr. Trump said European regulators saw \"easy money\" in imposing large fines against American firms. \"They are actually attacking our companies, but we should be doing what they are doing,\" he said.</p><p>News Corporation and Axel Springer, the biggest German publisher, have voiced concerns to European regulators about the influence of Google and Facebook over the news business.</p><p>The publishers lobbied heavily for a new European Union-wide copyright law, passed in March, requiring that large internet platforms pay a license for content shared on services like Google News.</p><p>Oracle and Yelp have also taken their complaints to Europe. Ken Glueck, Oracle's executive vice president and policy chief, said that Google's dominance of the market underpinning online ads had enabled it to stifle competition, including from Oracle.</p><p>\"We'd like to be bigger. But when you have one party who dominates the space and is acting with exclusionary conduct, that affects the market,\" Mr. Glueck said.</p><p>There is a bit of a revenge back story to Oracle's complaints about Google: The two companies have been locked in a nine-year legal battle with billions of dollars at stake.</p><p>Yelp contends that Google favors its own services over rivals in search results in both Europe and the United States, even when the Google content is lower quality or less relevant. Google has said it tries to give people quick answers to their questions instead of sending them to another site.</p><p>In 2013, the F.T.C. closed an investigation into Google's search practices after the company agreed to some narrow changes.</p><p>\"For so many years, U.S. companies were having to seek relief abroad because our own enforcement agencies weren't critically examining the questionable behavior of large firms like Google,\" Yelp's Mr. Lowe said.</p><p>The European Commission also opened an investigation of Amazon last September and has received informal complaints from eBay and the European e-commerce site Zalando, according to a person involved in the discussions who was not authorized to disclose them.</p><p>A central argument against the tech giants is that other companies must use their platforms because that's where their customers are. With that leverage, the argument goes, the tech giants force terms on other companies that are unfair and deepen their dominant positions.</p><p>Apple makes developers use its App Store to distribute their apps on iPhones and collects up to 30 percent of revenue made through activity inside the app. Spotify recently argued to European competition authorities that Apple used its App Store to punish Spotify's app and favor Apple's competing service.</p><p>Apple has said that it welcomes competition and that it has long helped Spotify reach customers. The only time it has requested changes to Spotify's app is when it \"tried to sidestep the same rules that every other app follows,\" Apple said in a statement in March. Spotify had directed customers to pay it directly so Apple wouldn't get a cut.</p><p>News publishers rely on Google and Facebook to send readers their way. But publishers say that to appear high on those sites, they are encouraged by both companies to use technologies that make Google and Facebook, instead of the news sites themselves, destinations for news. Google and Facebook also dominate the digital-advertising market, the publishers say, squeezing one of their main revenue streams.</p><p>Google and Facebook said they competed for ad dollars with a wide range of online and offline platforms, including television, radio, newspapers and billboards. Both said their technologies helped news publishers increase ad revenue.</p><p>Google in recent years dropped an effective requirement for publishers to make their news free via Google search results, and introduced a program to help news sites increase subscriptions.</p><p>A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was working on products and training to help news outlets make more money from their articles on Facebook and had committed $300 million in the next three years to support local news.</p><p>Musicians say they must put their songs on YouTube, which is owned by Google, to reach fans, but YouTube pays below-market royalty rates. \"Hopefully, these investigations drive real change to make sure fans, songwriters and artists all get a fair shake,\" said Rosanne Cash, the singer-songwriter who is co-chairwoman of the Artist Rights Alliance, an advocacy group for musicians and songwriters.</p><p>Google has said YouTube helps artists reach new audiences and get paid, at the same royalty rates as Spotify.</p><p>Some companies that sell goods on Amazon have argued that they have to be on its site to reach customers. Yet they fret that Amazon can use data about their sales to develop its own competing products. The trade group for major shoe brands, including Nike, Crocs and Dr. Martens, asked the F.T.C. to look into the \"dual role\" of platforms like Amazon.</p><p>An Amazon executive, Jeff Wilke, said at an event last week that those in-house brands were \"a tiny fraction\" of Amazon sales. \"We do not allow anyone inside Amazon to have access to individual sellers' data in order to build a private-label product,\" he said.</p><p>A Senate hearing last month offered a preview of the potential drama to come in Washington.</p><p>Brian O'Kelley, founder of an ad-technology company called AppNexus, testified  that in 2008 he invented an automated bidding system for advertisers that \"turned every ad on the internet into a real-time auction.\" AppNexus grew to 600 employees.</p><p>\"Google's response to the threat from AppNexus was that of a classic monopolist,\" he said. Google told AppNexus clients that they would need to also use Google's ad technology if they wanted to serve ads on YouTube, he testified.</p><p>AppNexus's business slumped, and it laid off 100 employees in 2016. AT&amp;amp;T bought it last year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Follow Jack Nicas and Karen Weise on Twitter: @jacknicas and @KYWeise.

The only time it has requested changes to Spotify's app is when it \"tried to sidestep the same rules that every other app follows,\" Apple said in a statement in March. Spotify had directed customers to pay it directly so Apple wouldn't get a cut.</p><p>News publishers rely on Google and Facebook to send readers their way. But publishers say that to appear high on those sites, they are encouraged by both companies to use technologies that make Google and Facebook, instead of the news sites themselves, destinations for news. Google and Facebook also dominate the digital-advertising market, the publishers say, squeezing one of their main revenue streams.</p><p>Google and Facebook said they competed for ad dollars with a wide range of online and offline platforms, including television, radio, newspapers and billboards. Both said their technologies helped news publishers increase ad revenue.</p><p>Google in recent years dropped an effective requirement for publishers to make their news free via Google search results, and introduced a program to help news sites increase subscriptions.</p><p>A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was working on products and training to help news outlets make more money from their articles on Facebook and had committed $300 million in the next three years to support local news.</p><p>Nicas and Weise write</p><p>for The New York Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0096246172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9T-01P1-DY37-F1FF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1147\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Congressman Dan Crenshaw is on my \"Untold Story\" podcast right now. Free to subscribe and listen and get them all as they come out. His is excellent. I learned a lot about him that I never knew before. Rising star in his party to be sure. We will see you back here tomorrow night at 7:00. Tucker Carlson is coming up next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. For more than two long years. The institutional left told us they knew exactly what the Mueller report would say. They said it would end the Trump presidency and save this nation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressman Adam Schiff, who sits on the Intel Committee and would know gave us a preview. Schiff said that he had seen with his own eyes, proof that the President of the United States colluded criminally with the government of Russia.</p><p>BuzzFeed, a noted cat blog said it had conclusive evidence that Trump obstructed justice. ABC News momentarily tanked stock prices when it reported that Trump had ordered his National Security adviser to talk to the Russians, and so on.</p><p>The Mueller report is going to prove all of these stories true. And then the report came out, and it turns out that none of it was true. It was all a lie. So how did the people who told and repeated those lies respond? Well, they could have done what decent people do. They could have resigned their jobs, tearfully apologize for misleading our country and then move to Paraguay in shame. They could have done that, but they didn't.</p><p>Instead, they did what they always do. They became more aggressive. They decided that actually the Mueller report vindicated everything they've been saying since 2016. It's all there. It's just being hidden by that dastardly Attorney General Robert Barr -- William Barr -- whatever. Barr - - suddenly Barr was right up there with Putin and George Papadopoulos as an enemy of the people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Are you talking about just having him sit for a hearing or locking him up somehow?</p><p>REP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN): You have to have him sit for hearing and I think you have to have him locked up unless he agrees to participate and come to the hearing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The House and the Senate, each chamber has an inherent power to compel a witness to testify if that witness just refuses, and that includes arrest and it even includes jail. The House is powerless unless the House take some action.</p><p>REP. JACKIE SPEIER (D-CA): We have what's called inherent contempt proceedings, which means we send to the sergeant of arms out to handcuff the individual who is declining to testify.</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Okay, who are going to handcuff.</p><p>SPEIER: Well, I'm going to start with Mr. Barr.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: These people are fascists. \"Cuff him, lock him up, send him to jail.\" The man who has been Attorney General for less than three months must be in prison for his crimes -- whatever those crimes are -- and the President must go on trial, too. Now, you might think that being cleared of collusion by the Mueller report would be good news for Trump. But no, it's just means he must be impeached.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: To invite a foreign power participate in our elections, to obstruct justice and cover up during the investigation, there must be consequences. There must be accountability. We must get behind the House of Representatives that they pursue impeachment for this President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: He almost wishes campaign wasn't over, that it would go on forever. So every night we get new clips of the hat and the bouncing and the hand gestures. It's so great. But did you hear what he said? He said impeached no matter what the cost. Impeachment is a theological imperative. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you concerned that impeachment talk may actually help the President's reelection?</p><p>REP. AL GREEN (D, TX): I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this President, he will get reelected.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Impeach him before the people choose him as their President again. That's how democracy works. Now watching all of this, you might assume that the left has lost control of itself and you would be half right. The Democratic base has been emotionally incontinent for quite some time. They're getting worse, not better. And you can thank the internet for that.</p><p>But the people who run the party are not crazy. They are coolly rational, they always have been. They want power. That's all they want. Whatever it takes. These people don't throw fits unless it's serve some higher political purpose. And this fit does serve a higher purpose. They're trying to divert attention from a much bigger story.</p><p>Remember, when Trump said the Obama administration had been spying on his campaign, the Democratic Party's boot lickers went absolutely crazy the second he said it. They rushed to the nearest television studio to mock the very idea.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: President Trump has a new favorite word and every time he uses it, he is lying. And that is the word \"spy.\"</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: His baseless claims of spies.</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: This so-called spy issue -- first of all, there is absolutely no evidence there was a spy. So it's really a fake issue.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: He wants you to believe that his campaign was spied on and it's one of the worst things that we've ever seen from government.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I think looking back, the VCR, one of the great inventions in human history, maybe fire, the wheel, the VCR because it allows us to preserve people's claims on tape, and then play them back. The group you just saw were hysterical at the idea that Trump might believe there was spying on his campaign. They were hysterical because they suspected it might actually be true.</p><p>And now we know that it was. In fact, according to recent testimony from a high ranking FBI official, the spying turned out to be far more extensive than Trump suspected, even James Clapper had to concede that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Using undercover agents is a standard and legitimate technique that is widely used in investigations. That technique has been used to thwart a lot of counterterrorism plots in this country. So I'm sure -- I mean, there are protocols and standards for using an agent and I'm sure that's the case here.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Was it spying?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, yes, I guess it meets the different -- the dictionary definition of surveillance or spying, a term I don't particularly like.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, the guy who ran the spy agency doesn't like the word \"spying.\" Eric Felten broke the story that there may have been more than one government informant embedded in Trump's campaign. He wrote it for \"National Review\" online and he joins us on the set tonight. Eric, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>ERIC FELTEN, CONTRIBUTOR, NATIONAL REVIEW ONLINE: Tucker, how you doing?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm -- well, I'm I feel like most people who thought maybe Trump was onto something kind of vindicated tonight. But even those of us who thought there might have been spying I think are not prepared to learn what you've reported, which is -- was real spying.</p><p>FELTEN: Well, what's interesting about it is you had Jonathan Moffa, who is Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI, sort of head of intelligence analysis, and he was put together with Pete Strzok -- you remember Peter Strzok.</p><p>CARLSON: Very well.</p><p>FELTEN: As the core two people putting together the Trump investigation, the Trump-Russia investigation at the beginning of August 2016. And they Pete Strzok sent a text message -- always the text messages from Pete Strzok -- in which he wanted to organize what they were going to talk about at their sort of first organizational meeting.</p><p>And at their first organizational meeting, they talked about CHSs, Confidential Human Sources, and liaison which is an FBI term for working with spy agencies, whether it's the CIA, or foreign agencies.</p><p>So from the get-go, right from the beginning of the investigation, using spies was on the table as one of the things that the team was going to use.</p><p>CARLSON: So now, there's evidence that there was more than one.</p><p>FELTEN: Right. We know that the Christopher Steele was a confidential human source.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>FELTEN: And we know that Stefan Halper was a confidential human source. This is the Cambridge professor. And we know that as Azra Turk pretending to be Stefan Halper's assistant was some kind of informant or --</p><p>CARLSON: You know, some of these people were paid with tax dollars, correct?</p><p>FELTEN: Oh, yes. No, Stefan Halper, has over the years gotten paid lots and lots of money. He does analysis papers for the Defense Security Agency writing position papers that he gets paid $300,000.00 for and it ends up being a way in which the money for Stefan Halper is paid out of the sort of black bag.</p><p>But what's interesting is Jonathan Moffa in closed-door testimony back in August on Capitol Hill, was asked just how many confidential human sources there were in the investigation, and he couldn't answer the question. If it had just been one or two or three, that would have been easy. Instead, he had to say, well, there were confidential human sources. I just don't know how many there were.</p><p>CARLSON: Shocking. And shocking. Hopefully, we will know. Thank you for that reporting, Eric Felten. Great to see you.</p><p>FELTEN: Good to see Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Mollie Hemingway is covering the story and has been for \"The Federalist\" and she joins us tonight. Mollie, so why haven't we heard Stefan Halper long-standing government source and as Eric Felten just said, a long-standing recipient of U.S. tax dollars. I believe he is still in London tonight. Why is he not testifying before a congressional committee and answering basic questions about this.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We have this amazing situation going on where we had the Russia hoax -- this allegation that the Donald Trump campaign, treasonously colluded with Russia -- to steal the 2016 election that ended with a fizzle. Robert Mueller decline to indict a single American for that.</p><p>At the same time, we start learning these other things, such as what Eric Felten has just reported on about a wide-ranging campaign against the Trump campaign that used human informants, National Security letters, wiretaps, the Azra Turk character, and I don't think that's her real name is an actual government official, I believe, who was sent to London to oversee the operation.</p><p>We know that there were probably four people who were surveilled, at least. We don't know so much about this and the media show a shocking lack of curiosity. \"The New York Times\" actually broke this story about Azra Turk, but then they kind of downplayed it and acted like, \"But don't worry, this doesn't actually support. We're going to tell you all about this spy.\" But that doesn't support Donald Trump's contention that he was spied on.</p><p>In fact, it completely supports the contention that the campaign was spied on, and they need to cover it with the same rigor that they devoted to the crazy conspiracy theory that they fell for, for multiple years.</p><p>CARLSON: Donald Trump now \"controls,\" I guess, air quotes, or he doesn't actually control much of his own government, as we've seen, but at least, ostensibly controls the FBI and CIA right now and could dispatch them on phony pretext as Obama did to him, sic them on the presidential campaigns of his opponents.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well --</p><p>CARLSON: Aren't they worried about that?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: There is an actual issue going back many decades of a complex within the government that is not very politically accountable, but for the first time in two years, we actually have a department --</p><p>CARLSON: But wait a minute, can you just pause with it. So why is that not an attack on democracy?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: It is a huge threat that was warned about from every President from Eisenhower on or that people have been concerned about since Eisenhower on, but there is now finally political accountability at the Department of Justice. And that's why you see so many people upset that we now have an Attorney General who has expressed merely an interest into looking into this. He hasn't said that he's going to go after Donald Trump's enemies or anything like that. He just says, \"I'd like to know more about how this began. I'd like to know more about what protocols were followed.\" And the media and various people who are in the agencies at the time are just absolutely freaking out.</p><p>CARLSON: So this is why Congresswoman Speier and that little rice guy are both saying he should go to jail?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: So the Attorney General might actually find out why the spying was allowed, the extent of it and for that crime, he should go to jail?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Well, it was a great plan to spend all these years on this conspiracy theory to delegitimize Donald Trump's election. And if it instead turns out to be sort of a boon for him, that that all the things he said about it were true and that nobody was indicted for treasonous collusion with Russia, it is something I don't think they are psychologically prepared to accept at this point. And that's why you're seeing so many people react so strongly.</p><p>Remember, it was just a year ago that we were told that any critique on Robert Mueller was an attack on the Republic, it was a threat to rule of law. We couldn't have administration of justice if we attacked -- if we even criticized in any way Robert Mueller. Well, what's going on then with this extreme criticism of William Barr simply for saying he would like to make sure that our Federal agencies that are tasked with law enforcement and intelligence gathering were following protocol?</p><p>CARLSON: And a sitting Member of Congress says he should be in handcuffs for that. It tells you a lot about it. I hope they never get power. I mean that. Mollie, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Hillary Clinton says the 2016 election was stolen from her. She is not the only Democrat who has decided you never need to concede an election. That's for losers. The great Mark Steyn responds after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Hillary Clinton continues her grievance tour around the United States. It could be coming to a town near you soon. Tickets at this point are heavily discounted, they are probably paying people to go by the very end.</p><p>It's never quite clear who Hillary will blame for her election loss. But we do know she never blames herself or her failure to campaign in key states like Wisconsin, by the way, we don't think the tour is going to Appleton anytime soon. She didn't make it to LA though the other day where she implied that the 2016 election was quote, \"stolen\" from her. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it's also critical to understand that, as I've been telling candidates who have come to see me, you can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee and you can have the elections stolen from you.</p><p>(Cheering and Applause)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, they stole it. They stole it. Sad. And she's not the only Democrat disputing election outcomes. Failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams says that she won her election. At a fundraiser in Houston over the weekend, Abrams told her audience quote, \"I'm here to tell you a secret that makes Breitbart and Tucker Carlson go crazy. We won.\" She said, \"I am not delusional.\" That's reassuring. \"I know I am not the governor of Georgia -- possibly yet.\"</p><p>Although, whenever they tell you, \"I am not delusional,\" which is always at the guy next to you and the bus tries to assure you. It makes you wonder. In reality, Abrams did lose that race by more than 50,000 votes. It's not a close margin. The great irony in all of this is the Democrats say that Trump can't accept election outcomes.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just told \"The New York Times\" she worries about whether the President will accept the 2020 results if Democrats win by a narrow margin. She felt the same way about the midterms. You should recall that before last November, she believed that quote, \"If we win by four seats by a thousand votes each. He is not going to respect the election.\" Because everything is projection. Sigmund Freud called it.</p><p>Mark Steyn is a bestselling author, and really the best guest on TV and joins us tonight. So here is yet another example, Mark, of them accusing you of what they're doing. Are they not aware that they're doing this?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Yes. I think Hillary Clinton is totally unaware when she says that, you know, you run the best campaign and all the rest of it -- she is actually clutching at straws as to why the inevitable candidate did not win. But this is really the flip side of what you were talking about with Mollie just now because these two stories run in parallel.</p><p>The Democrats essentially provide political cover for all these FBI types, monkeying around wiretapping and surveilling the opposition, because if the Democrats didn't lend it political cover, we would all see it for what it is -- the deep state gone rogue.</p><p>At the same time, the deep state's investigation of George Papadopoulos and co, provides cover for the Democrats as to why Trump's victories -- Republican victories -- are never legitimate. So in a sense, these two things operate on twin tracks and support each other.</p><p>But when you have someone like Stacey Abrams actually saying, \"We don't need to concede anymore, because this entire system is oppressive and out to get us.\" The Democrats are coming close actually, to making politics entirely impossible. And when you do that, it doesn't actually leave much else except Civil War. So by delegitimizing this process, they are actually playing with matches.</p><p>CARLSON: When you say that the election is illegitimate, because the system is illegitimate because the founding documents are illegitimate, because the people who wrote them were racist. And at a certain point, aren't you really saying like, \"I don't need to play by your rules. I'm just going to seize power when I can.\"</p><p>STEYN: Well, Stacey Abrams argument is, \"Unless I win, the election was rigged,\" and Hillary Clinton, who is a far more senior figure than Stacey Abrams, actually came close to saying that on stage in Los Angeles, \"Because I didn't win, the system must be rigged.\"</p><p>And actually, when we read that Nancy Pelosi thing, I don't think Trump is like that at all. I think if Trump were to lose narrowly, he'd sound off on Twitter. He'd say the presidency is for losers. Living in the White House was so degrading after you've lived in Trump Tower. I'm going to build a fabulous new Trump Resort in Kazakhstan, screw you all. He'd have a ball with -- if he lost, he'd have a ball and he'd be gone.</p><p>But what the Democrats have done for the last two years, in particular, Hillary Clinton. It's Hillary Clinton's refusal to lose tied to what we've been talking about with all these deep state guys going rogue, in alliance with foreign Intelligence agencies, eavesdropping, monitoring, trying to entrap American citizens, these two crimes are actually the same crime and one half supports the other half.</p><p>CARLSON: Very smart. As always, Mark Steyn, thank you.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks, Tucker. Great being with you.</p><p>CARLSON: Silicon Valley is dramatically stepping up its efforts to silence viewpoints it disagrees with, anything right of center. It's not your imagination. It's happening right now before the 2020 election for the purpose of influencing that election.</p><p>Facebook just banned a number of prominent conservatives earlier this week, essentially wiping them off the internet. The rest of us are supposed to think that's okay. The latest victim is the conservative Claremont Institute, which wanted to buy Google ads, in order to promote a gala -- an anniversary gala. Google declined to sell those ads to Claremont because Claremont had published an essay that violated Google's race and ethnicity policy. Read the essay for yourself. Nothing racist about it, actually, not even close.</p><p>Google now says that decision was a mistake and it will allow Claremont to purchase ads now that Claremont complained and has gone public, including on this show. It's interesting though, how those mistakes always go in exactly the same direction.</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon knows a lot about this. She is one of the most famous attorneys in America on the question of big tech and its threat to our liberties and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So it was a mistake. How many times have we heard this from some big tech company or another when caught silencing conservatives?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, we hear it every other day and Tucker, I am not delusional, and people are actually discriminating against conservatives every day this way and they're gas lighting us by saying, \"Oh, it was just a mistake.\" You imagine that?</p><p>I mean, the chilling effect that occurs every time this happens publicly is that it keeps normal conservatives far from the boundaries. It keeps them from saying anything that they think might be controversial and because these rules that they have are unwritten and constantly evolving and being made up all the time, they make a mockery of the concept of contract between consenting adults, and they simply -- people don't know where they stand. It's really an Orwellian type of a situation.</p><p>CARLSON: So, but think of the practical consequences. So newspapers are all but dead. Radio is in decline in general. Cable news speaks with one voice, with the exception of just a very few shows, this among them. So really, social media, that's the entire political conversation. That's where it takes place and if you control the terms, then you control the outcome of the election, don't you?</p><p>DHILLON: You will, and Republicans are ignoring this at their peril. And I keep saying this, I feel like you know, Cassandra, I keep saying this, we are going to lose every single election going forward if we don't put a stop to this bias.</p><p>Now, you know, some either conservatives who are being paid off by big tech, or simply ill-informed say, \"Oh, well, this is just, this is just competition. This is just the market. If you don't like Twitter, you don't like Facebook, go make your own.\" I mean, these are all statements made by people who've never started their own companies and were paid by think tanks. They don't know what it means to start a business. And so that's ludicrous.</p><p>And now these companies have all built themselves up to the point of monopoly power on the back of protectionist government regulation, Communications Decency Act Section 230 and others. Now that they've gotten there and they've crowded out everybody else, they are now changing the rules on us.</p><p>So from last year, Facebook advertising that it was going to allow controversial pages on the right and on the left up so that there could be a dialogue; today, they're simply snuffing out people completely.</p><p>Now, they're snuffing out people who probably you or I don't necessarily hang out with, listen to or follow like, that's not the point and that's how they're doing it. They're testing the waters so nobody protested when it was Alex Jones. Now they're not protesting with a few more and pretty soon, it's going to be people closer to you or me or even one of us are silenced or be silenced.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it will be us, and when Republicans lose every election that matters in the next cycle and they wonder why. \"I wonder why our message didn't get through.\" Okay.</p><p>DHILLON: Exactly. Exactly. And it may be too late.</p><p>CARLSON: Harmeet. It is great to see you.</p><p>DHILLON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Please continue sounding that alarm.</p><p>DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, here's a kind of amazing fact that should be on the front page of every paper, a secret Department of Defense program paid for researchers to run psychological evaluations on people who said they've encountered UFOs. Apparently, warehouses were rented, it sounds kooky, but this is actually being reported by \"The New York Times,\" where metal from downed UFO could be stored what. What? When did that happen and why did nobody tell us? We will tell you what we know after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a lot of people believe that there might be life on other planets. Apparently, a lot of people who do work in the U.S. government which secretly over the years, we now learned has spent millions on a program that investigated UFO reports. So what did they find and does that program still exist? We asked Fox News Headlines, Brett Larson to explore that question for us. He joins us tonight with the outcome. Hey, Brett.</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 ANCHOR: Hey, Tucker. Yes, we have fearlessly reported on previous reports of UFO sightings or what the military sometimes calls Unexplained Aerial Phenomena, detailed by Navy pilots and other members of the military.</p><p>Now it's a situation that the Pentagon piqued the world's interest in, when they release some declassified documents that made it clear the government is keeping an eye on the skies, and potential UFOs a bit closer than anyone would have expected.</p><p>Now that release included the now infamous video from 2017 of what is clearly some kind of flying object that honestly does not match any of the physics I remember learning about or any aircraft design any of us have ever seen outside of science fiction.</p><p>But the story actually got a little more interesting. It turns out, former U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada put together a multimillion dollar investigation into the Pentagon's UFO files, and it included a real life Fox Mulder tasked with cataloging, not just those documents related to UFO reports, but also to collect actual debris.</p><p>In fact, a company was hired to modify buildings in Las Vegas to store metal alloys and other materials that were reportedly from sites where these unexplained events happened.</p><p>Now, people who have had encounters have been tested for any physical changes. Military personnel were interviewed about what they saw. Now we know what some of them saw from the 2017 video captured over the Pacific when multiple military officers confirmed this mysterious sighting including pilots and radar technicians.</p><p>The program to catalog then revealed to the public what was found has been canceled. Tracking UFO by the military isn't stopping. In fact, they're going to keep it for a simple reason. The military needs to know who is doing this and what their intent is.</p><p>Now unfortunately, this means we may not get to see those detailed reports, those mind blowing videos or as one of the pilot said of something seen out his window truly radical technology. All of the data they collect may simply end up in a chart that shows an uptick in sightings in their locations as we all collectively wait for those documents to be declassified.</p><p>I want to know where it's coming from and I want a tour of this warehouse to see these metal alloys. This is kind of amazing.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, since they say they have multiple sightings per month --</p><p>LARSON: Yes, this isn't like a once a year or maybe -- we can't excuse it as a falling star. This is happening a lot.</p><p>CARLSON: No. It's not a drunk guy in a field in New Hampshire. No, no.</p><p>LARSON: No, these are very well trained pilots and military personnel.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, guys with nuclear payloads who are quite sober.</p><p>LARSON: Yes, you know, you're hoping they know what they're looking at and I want to know what they're seeing.</p><p>CARLSON: I do, too. Brett Larson, thank you very much for that.</p><p>LARSON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, one of the things you most frequently heard then candidate Trump say was that China was ripping us off. Yet more than two years into his presidency, the trade deficit with China has actually grown quite a bit dramatically, really.</p><p>Last year, the United States ran a $419 billion trade deficit with China. For perspective, that's enough money to pay off our country's entire revolving credit card debt. Instead, that all goes to the fascist government of China.</p><p>Now, the President says in response to these plans to increase tariffs on some Chinese products to 25 percent. He announced that last night. For perspective on what this means we go, as we often do to Michael Pillsbury, the author of the book, \"The Hundred Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.\" Dr. Pillsbury joins us now. Thanks very much for coming on. So is this the beginning of a new chapter of U.S.-China relations, do you think?</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, AUTHOR: Yes, it is. The President obviously got upset if that's the right word.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Perhaps infuriated by the Chinese reneging on what they had promised in writing over the last few months. And I think he probably saw this as a test of strength by his friend, Xi Jinping. The reaction, therefore, was very swift. The tweet came not too long after the President learned of China taking back concessions that had made in writing.</p><p>Actually, I knew about some of the details of the agreement. I was quite impressed. I praised the President directly that you've done more than any previous President to get this far. But I had a faint feeling, Tucker that the Chinese leadership had not really blessed this agreement. And that apparently, is what happened.</p><p>Liu He, the chief negotiator has the rank of Vice Premier. He's a well- known economist and reformer in China. He signed a number of studies 10 or 15 years ago, one is called China 2030, trying to reduce the amount of state control to open up China's markets, not steal intellectual property, so to make him the chief negotiator was a test of him and perhaps he went too far.</p><p>And then with -- the book I wrote is about the hawks in China, the nationalistic, I like Steve Bannon, let's just call him the Steve Bannon of China. He got hold of these concessions and this text, which we keep secret, we don't quite know who in China can look at it. It's about 150 pages long. And apparently there was a reaction in China that we're not going to accept this, take it back.</p><p>But when President Trump heard about it, he has immediately responded with these harsh punitive tariffs been increased on Friday. So now we're in a whole new chapter, as you say.</p><p>CARLSON: It's amazing. Very quickly, if this happens, we assess at 25 percent tariff levy on some Chinese imports into this country. What does that -- I mean, that upends a lot of their model, right?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes, it hurts them. We don't know exactly how much it hurts them. But the first round of tariffs brought them to the table quite quickly. So there's reason to believe it's still possible to get a deal. But the first step the Chinese have to take and it might happen as early as this week, is to undo the reneging. The next step will be to close the deal on the enforcement mechanisms.</p><p>I think the reason China is doing this is this fight between the hawks and doves or the hawks and the reformers is not over yet in China. When a side losers over there, they don't just go home and mope. They get put in jail.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, right. Thank you very much for that.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: China's communist government has a long history of putting people in jail. Right now, they're rounding up millions of ethnic minorities, mostly Muslims and sending them to reeducation camps in their vast remote desert.</p><p>The victims are mostly Uyghurs, that's an ethnic group that lives in northwestern part of the country. Those who avoid the camps live in a horrifying surveillance state with travel restrictions, ethnic profiling, vehicle checkpoints, et cetera. Uyghur officials are not allowed to practice their religion, attend mosque or fast during Ramadan. The goal is to destroy all traces of Uyghur identity. It is textbook ethnic cleansing.</p><p>Here's the weird thing. The international left doesn't really seem to care. Millions of Muslims rounded up and put in camps barely a mention from liberals. Why? Because it's happening in China and not Kentucky. Therefore, it's okay.</p><p>Joe Biden clearly paid attention to high school history class. First, he said, Republicans want to put African-Americans back in chains, now he says they want to bring back Jim Crow. The remarkable developments, next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Democrats running for the nomination this year are obviously in an arms race who is to see who can make the most flamboyant statements and push the most aggressive racial incitement. Joe Biden is the presumptive front runner. Here's part of what he said to predominantly African-American audience in South Carolina over the weekend. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Last year, 24 states introduced to enact at least 70 bills to curtail the right to vote. And guess what? Mostly directed at quote \"people of color.\" You see it. We've got Jim Crow sneaking back in. No, I mean it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The guy is an idiot. Obviously the question is, what does it do to the country when you say things like that? And what exactly is he talking about? It is a single word that just you just watched on television? Is it true? Is it rooted in reality in any way? It's a real question here, because you're going to hear more of it.</p><p>Max Burns is a Democratic strategy. He joins us tonight. So, Max, there was a -- I think the conclusive study on this was just done in February out of Harvard on the question of voter ID laws, which are by far the most controversial, right? Republicans say we need them because they, obviously are a hedge against voter fraud, and Democrats say they're racist.</p><p>So here's the study found, we find that strict voter ID laws have no significant effect on registration or turnout. They do not decrease the participation of ethnic minorities relative to whites. And it goes on like that, but it's conclusive. Why is no one acknowledging the facts of this? Why are they still calling it Jim Crow?</p><p>MAX BURNS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, and as you say, one study, and Joe Biden is only wrong in the sense that thinking that Jim Crow has ever actually gone away. I mean, African-American voters, Latino voters have experienced having their votes invalidated for decades.</p><p>I mean, look at North Carolina, where they just throw their votes directly in the trash. There's nothing more suppressive than that.</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, okay, there's no -- okay, first of all, there's no one -- anyone's votes were thrown away in this generation in North Carolina and in the specific case you're talking about on the basis of race, that's a lie as you know. Second, you blew right -- hold on, you blew right past the fact.</p><p>BURNS: So corrupt they had to redo the entire election, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: But there is no evidence just to restate as someone who is familiar with exactly what you're talking about, that anyone's votes were discarded because of the color of their skin. That's just not true. And to say otherwise to suggest that you don't know what you're talking about, or you're misleading our audience.</p><p>I just wanted you to respond to the study that I cited, which is not written by right-wingers, that voter ID laws have no effect on voter turnout. They're not just inherently discriminatory. Do you have another study that shows the opposite that's more current than this one or bigger?</p><p>BURNS: Here's the problem, and I'm glad you mentioned the turnout question, because here's the problem with that turnout point in the study is that the turnout doesn't show you how hard people had to fight to get there. If a black voter has to work twice as hard to get to a polling place to register to vote at all, that is not an equitable similarity to a white person vote.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no, but voter ID laws are separate and distinct from the question for polling places, or I think I'm too literal for this moment because nobody tells the truth, but everyone just lies for political effect. And here I am, like, arguing a point of fact, I guess, maybe I should give up and just become a demagogue like everyone else.</p><p>I'm talking about voter ID voter law. Voter ID laws do not according to this study, the definitive study on it, don't suppress African-American voting turn out, they don't make it harder. I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.</p><p>BURNS: Correct. And the fact that African-Americans are turning out in those numbers, even with the hurdles they have to face, the difficulty in getting a license, the difficulty and even finding a polling place that hasn't been shut down.</p><p>CARLSON: What do you mean the difficulty? How patronizing can you be? Why is it harder for black people to get a driver's license? What are you talking about?</p><p>BURNS: Are you are -- there are only 11 states in the country that require you to have a license to vote, and oddly enough, those states that are largely affecting Democratic-leaning voters, African-American voters, well, why make it expensive to get a license, expensive to get copies of your own documentation.</p><p>CARLSON: What about -- hold on -- let me just, I'm sorry, obviously you don't care about whether what you say is true or not. But let me just ask you two quick questions. Is it racist to require an ID to fly in an airplane? Or to stay in a hotel or to cash a check or to get welfare benefits or to do anything? Is that racist to you?</p><p>BURNS: None of which are your fundamental constitutional right to vote.</p><p>CARLSON: What about to have a job? You can't have a job without a government ID.</p><p>BURNS Would you agree that you have a fundamental constitutional right to vote, Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: We have a fundamental constitutional right to a lot of things, to own a gun, okay, and to vote, to have a job -- and all of these things require an ID, but none of that is racist. Only voting? What?</p><p>BURNS: And in fact, Tucker, you know, buying a gun doesn't require an ID, first off, and let's point out fact that after African-American voters --</p><p>CARLSON: Son, I doubt you've bought many guns. I have. Yes it does. I just bought one. I can't deal with this. Max, thank you.</p><p>BURNS: Tucker, I come from Virginia. I bought a gun without a driver's license in cash at a gun show.</p><p>CARLSON: Not at a gun show you didn't. No, maybe from a buddy but not in a gun show or a gun store. Sorry, I know a lot about this stuff.</p><p>BURNS: At the largest gun show in Virginia. So yes, you do not need a license to exercise your rights.</p><p>CARLSON: Not anymore. Unfortunately, I was there two weeks ago. You need an ID. All right, Max, this is -- I appreciate it. Thank you so much.</p><p>BURNS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is running for President. There's no one in New York who thinks de Blasio is impressive. Why is he running for President? How unimpressive is he? We will speak to the world's expert on Bill de Blasio's un-impressiveness after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is universally regarded as a clown. He takes a nap at City Hall, uses police helicopters to avoid traffic, shows up late to everything, marijuana smokes wafts out of Gracie Mansion. Despite all of this, he is planning a presidential run. Seth Barron covers him for the \"City Journal\" and joins us tonight. Seth, who is this Bill de Blasio who is now going to run for President?</p><p>SETH BARRON, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, CITY JOURNAL: Well, he's got us all on tenterhooks here if he's going to run or not. He says this is the -- it is believed that this is the week he's going to announce.</p><p>Bill de Blasio is a mayor who has won consistently on very low turnout, driven mostly by the public sector unions and the professional nonprofit class mostly funded by the city. He has expanded spending in the city by $20 billion per year from $72 billion to $92 billion this year, largely funded by the stock market and Wall Street which he detests.</p><p>Bill de Blasio's new saying, his motto is, \"There's plenty of money in this country, it's just in the wrong hands.\" But I think we know whose hands it belongs to.</p><p>CARLSON: But Bill de Blasio is the driving force behind decriminalizing public urination in New York City.</p><p>BARRON: That's right. Yes. Decriminalizing public urination, decriminalizing fare beating, decriminalizing marijuana smoking, all of which have contributed to a decline in you know, public order, I think you would say.</p><p>We're not quite at the level of San Francisco yet with feces littering every sidewalk. We might be getting there soon and the subways are a real mess. One thing you neglected to point out is that de Blasio takes an armed convoy to the gym every morning. He drives 11 miles back there and back at about 10:00 a.m. Most New Yorkers are hard at work at their desks at that hour. De Blasio likes to go to the gym and then get a croissant at his favorite cafe.</p><p>And let me add, he says that he does this so he can stay out of the political bubble. This is what he does to be with the common people. This is his common touch.</p><p>CARLSON: If Bill de Blasio runs for President, obviously, we're rooting for him here. I hope you'll be able our de Blasio correspondent. Seth Barron.</p><p>BARRON: Oh, I hope so.</p><p>CARLSON: I hope you will. Thank you. Good to see you. Republicans spent decades pushing financial regulation and free trade deals -- is that agenda international interest? It's an issue that we've addressed quite a bit on this show. Someone who has thought deeply about it is Johnny Burtka, he is Executive Director of the American Conservative, fantastic site, and he joins us today.</p><p>So Johnny, very simple question for you. What would a conservative economic policy look like?</p><p>JOHNNY BURTKA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE: Thank you so much for having me, Tucker. There are two fallacies about the economy that elites believe here in Washington, DC. The first is that bigger is always better. They love monopolies in this city. Second, is that free trade is always beneficial. The question we need to ask is better for who?</p><p>Now in the case of corporate monopolies, this was something that Thomas Jefferson was so concerned about, he actually urged that James Madison include it in the Bill of Rights. It's clear, Tucker, based on the research that we've looked at that high industrial concentration results in higher prices for consumers and lower wages for workers and who benefits? It's the multinational corporation with no allegiance to America, to our system of government, or to the values that conservatives hold dear.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BURTKA: In fact, if multinational corporations had their way, they would do away with everything that conservatives value -- the nation state, borders, family, the church and even the concept of citizenship itself. Anything that gets in the way of the individual and the market, they want it gone. They want complete control.</p><p>CARLSON: Why -- every word you said is true. Given and obvious once you think about it. Given that, why in the world would you have politicians in Washington who call themselves conservatives who clearly have made their first allegiance to these corporations, which have no loyalty to United States whatsoever and hate everything conservatives say they are for?</p><p>BURTKA: I don't know, Tucker. But the good news is that there is a long Republican tradition and American tradition going all the way back to the American founding of standing up against concentrated corporate power, because it poses an existential threat to our political, cultural and economic well-being. And it's time that conservatives and Republicans and President Trump take the moral high ground back from the left and make this an issue front and center in the 2020 election.</p><p>CARLSON: The left all of this -- again, I couldn't agree with you more. The left all of a sudden, though, is the group defending the economic status quo and defending Jeff Bezos and the Google creeps and Travis from Uber. I mean, those are all liberals.</p><p>BURTKA: That's right. Well, they've made an alliance on their social issues, and they're willing to sacrifice their belief in equality and a society that works for everyone. And so now it's the perfect opportunity for conservatives to take this issue back to fight for an economy that puts American citizens first, American families first, and American workers first and if Republicans can do that, they can build a majority that will last for generations, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: But wait, in one sentence, answer this, the Chamber of Commerce and libertarians don't like it, you can't disobey them, can you?</p><p>BURTKA: We can do whatever we want, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Johnny Burtka. I think -- I wish we had 30 minutes because that was such an amazing summation with the crispest, cleanest description I've heard in such a short period of time. Thank you very much for that.</p><p>BURTKA: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: That's something to think about. I wish we had more time to talk about it because it really matters, unlike most things, but we'll be back tomorrow night 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn and absolutely sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. I am being encouraged to encourage you to figure out how to use the DVR attached to your television if you can, something I've never mastered, but good luck to you, those with engineering degrees. Good night from Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019050601cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W29-5SN1-JB20-G4CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7569\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 6, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Throughout history, consumers have relied on some form of payment system to purchase the goods or services they want or need. From bartering to mobile payment platforms, there is one consistent theme regarding the evolution of payments, that consumers prefer convenience. Generally, mobile payments are defined as the use of a mobile device - commonly, but not exclusively, a smartphone or tablet computer - to initiate a transfer of funds to people or businesses. </p><p>(Jeffrey M. Kopchik, FDIC[1]). The use of mobile payments continues to rise globally as consumers are increasingly capable of purchasing goods and services with apps such as Apple Pay, Google Wallet, PayPal, and more. United States ('U.S.') mobile sales are expected to grow from roughly 40 percent of e-commerce this year to 53.9 percent in 2021. (J. Clement, Statista[2]). As use continues to grow, regulators must make a choice as to whether to actively regulate the use of mobile payments to increase competition for the benefit of consumers or allow the free market to reign. As the mobile payment landscape changes and develops, consumers need to understand the risks, benefits, and costs of alternative payment mechanisms to choose the method that best suits them. As such, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the 'Division') has focused on the anti-competitive effect of conduct that restricts merchants' ability to influence consumers' payment choices and obstruct competition. (United States, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development[3]). The Federal Trade Commission (the 'FTC') also monitors U.S. payment systems for unfair or deceptive practices affecting consumers. Id. To date, no federal laws or regulations in the U.S. specifically govern mobile payments. However, anti-money laundering laws and acts combating the financing of terrorism, such as the Banking Secrecy Act and the U.S. Patriot Act, are interpreted to govern mobile payment transactions (United States Agency for International Development, Deloitte Consulting, LLP[4]). Additionally, consumer protection acts, including the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (the 'CARD Act'), the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 12 CFR Part 1005 ('Regulation E'), the Dodd-Frank Act, and FDIC CFR Part 205, are often interpreted to govern mobile payment transactions. Id.The expansion of mobile payment systems in Europe has prompted European regulators to start focusing on regulating mobile payments to prevent anti-competitive behavior as a few key players dominate the market. Article 101 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') prohibits anti-competitive agreements, decisions of associations of undertaking, and concerted practices that prevent, restrict or distort competition within the European Union market. (European Commission[5]). Article 102 of the TFEU prohibits the abuse of a dominant position within the European Union market. Id.European banks and payment providers worry that Apple Inc.'s digital wallet expansion in Europe will give Apple Pay services an unfair advantage by limiting access to a critical component only found inside iPhones- Near Field Communication ('NFC') chips. (Giles Turner, Bloomberg L.P.[6]). NFC chips enable wireless signals that allow Apple Pay users to scan their iPhones for instant charges in stores. Id. Kerstin Altendorf, a spokesperson for the Association of German Banks, is of the opinion that 'access to technical interfaces is now a key competitive factor for payment systems,' and 'the same conditions should apply to all market participants.' Id. Similarly, Isabelle de Silva, president of the Autorite de la concurrence in France, is also wary of Apple Pay and said there could be 'major competition concerns' when other dominant companies wish to enter the payments marketplace and do not have access to the same technology as Apple. (Anthony Aarons, Bloomberg L.P.[7]).While these comments focus on Apple, regulators and lawmakers in Europe are looking to curb the power of Silicon Valley technology platforms altogether. The European Union antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, began scrutinizing Apple Pay and has sought feedback on how iPhones may favor Apple Pay over other payment solutions. (Giles Turner, Bloomberg L.P.[8]). The Netherlands antitrust regulator followed suit and launched a market study to analyze the impact of big tech firms on its payments' market in October of 2019. Id. Germany enacted a law effective January 1, 2020, which will force Apple and other companies to open up its payment technology to other competitors for a reasonable fee. While consumers may use other mobile payment apps that process transactions through a Quick Response code ('QR code') that can be read quickly by a cell phone instead of NFC technology, Germany's rationale for its new law is to allow other companies and banks to utilize the NFC chip in mobile payment technology, as QR codes present security concerns. Id. According to James Moar, an analyst at Juniper Research, QR codes can easily be spoofed. Id.Recently, the European Commission has opened a formal antitrust investigation to assess whether Apple Pay, violates EU competition rules in the European Economic Area ('EEA') (European Commission[9]). The European Commission will be investigating Apple's terms and conditions, other measures for integrating Apple Pay in merchant apps and websites on iPhones and iPads, Apple's limitation of access to the NFC chips, and alleged refusals to allow access to Apple Pay. Id. Vestager's decision to look at Apple's practices comes as consumers are more accepting of mobile payment platforms, as COVID-19 has accelerated the use of online and contactless payments. Id. With Apple reserving the technology for mobile payments, Vestager believes it is important for consumers to have the benefits of new payment technologies, including 'better choice, quality, innovation, and competitive prices.' Id.Increased regulation of mobile payments in the European Union could propel the use of mobile payments all over the world and lead to the global standardization of mobile payments as other companies gain access to the technology necessary for mobile payments. Europe's step toward regulating mobile payments to prevent anti-competitive behavior could force other global leaders, including the U.S., to follow suit, especially as there are more considerable transaction savings for consumers.As mobile payment platforms increase and expand into new markets, increased regulation may naturally follow to ensure consumers are not denied access to choosing payment platform options that fit their wants and needs.

I continue to recommend the stocks of the first three, favoring Alphabet over Apple for reasons I outlined in my May 1 e-mail[3].  Get Our Activist Investing Case Study!

Q1 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[4] But all shareholders need to carefully follow these investigations (and similar ones happening all over the world) and consider their implications. For now, I believe they are unlikely to derail the dominance of these companies, but I'm open to changing my mind if the facts change. Personally, I think they should all be broken up, which would be good for society - and for shareholders. But barring a President Elizabeth Warren, this is extremely unlikely to happen... Here are two front-page articles from today's Wall Street Journal and New York Times: The Big Challenge for Policy Makers: Policing American Tech Giants[5]. Excerpt: They all have dominant market shares in their sectors - from search to social media[6], e-commerce, online advertising and smartphone apps - and are protected by practices and conditions that make it hard for new rivals to challenge them. Google and Amazon Are at the Center of a Storm Brewing Over Big Tech[7]. Excerpt: The regulators' moves are small and preliminary, and could easily come to nothing. But if the agencies pursue cases, Google and Amazon will almost certainly face reams of bad publicity, rising consumer distrust and falling employee morale. An inquiry would remind everyone that Google[8], with its early motto of \"Don't be evil,\" held itself to standards it sometimes could not match. 2) Today's Stock Idea of the Day is ad firm Criteo[9] (CRTO), which is around $18 a share and is trading near its all-time low in the five-and-a-half years it's been public. It was recently written up on Value Investor's Club. (For those of you who are members, click here[10]; for those who aren't, here are links to the 2016 long[11] and 2017 short[12] posts.) For the many readers who are new to this list, my Stock Idea of the Day is not a recommendation - just something I've found that I think is interesting enough to be worth further investigation... Here's my analyst, Steve Culbertson, on CRTO: If you're anything like me, when you hear \"online ads,\" you immediately think of tech behemoths Google, Facebook, and Amazon. So I was surprised to learn that this obscure company was a major player in this industry. Criteo launched in France in 2005 and has grown into a global company with 2,700 employees in 31 offices serving nearly 20,000 clients. The company analyzes more than $800 billion of online sales transactions and serves more than 1 trillion online ads annually.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Criteo-1.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Criteo-1.png</url>Criteo's business is in retargeting ads. Let me explain what that means... Every day, millions of people browse many e-commerce sites. Some know exactly what they want and complete their purchases, while others don't and are essentially \"window shopping.\" Yet another group is undecided. They know what they're looking for but haven't committed. These shoppers might have several shopping carts with the same or similar products for later consideration. You can imagine how online retailers want them to follow through with a purchase. Criteo helps them by retargeting personalized ads toward these high-intent shoppers. The company's software is embedded in thousands of retailers[13]' websites. Each time someone visits a site, Criteo gathers small pieces of information and weaves them into an online profile that it can then use to target ads. It's important to note that Criteo doesn't gather sensitive information, such as names or home addresses. Instead, it relies on analyzing data from more than 1.5 billion users to learn when and where to show the most appropriate ads. Criteo boasts a 90% customer retention rate, which it claims is a result of its system beating the competition 90% of the time in head-to-head tests. Supporting this claim is that 73% of the company's revenues come from uncapped budgets. In other words, its customers entrust Criteo to deploy ad dollars on their behalf - a sure sign of how valuable its service is. The stock went public in October 2013 and, as you can see in this chart, it's now close to an all-time low despite trailing 12-month operating income rising sixfold:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Criteo2.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Criteo2.png</url> What explains the stock's weakness? It started in June 2017, when Apple rolled out its Intelligent Tracking Prevention (\"ITP\") policy. This effectively made it impossible for Criteo and other ad tech[14] companies to track Safari users across different websites. The stock took another dive in March after this Adweek article, Google Mulls Third-Party Ad-Targeting Restrictions[15], which speculated that Google would implement its own ITP into its market-leading Chrome browser. The author of the VIC write-up argues that Google will not deploy ITP on its browser because it would be hurting its own ad business in the process. What's more, he thinks the company can return to a moderate rate of growth. If he's right, there could be substantial upside, as the stock is trading at low trailing multiples of 0.5 times EV/revenue, 4.6 times EV/EBITDA, and 14 times P/E. 3) Following up on last Thursday's e-mail[16] about Scott Galloway... If you don't have time to read his new book that I enjoyed so much, The Algebra of Happiness: Notes on the Pursuit of Success, Love, and Meaning[17], here are two interviews he did recently on YouTube[18] and a podcast[19] (I recommend listening to both at double speed). Best regards, Whitney The Phony Case For Electric Cars1) Here's an article that I'm sure will get some hackles up (and how evil I am for even sending it out): The Phony Case For Electric Cars[20]. Excerpt: ...... 'Cities should offer up-front incentives to buy zero-emission cars[21], for instance, as well as non-financial benefits such as parking vouchers. Higher taxes on petrol and diesel cars \u2014 whether via congestion tolls or at the pump \u2014 will encourage drivers to switch and offset some of the costs of the transition,' the editorial board says. ................  The truth is that every city in America has made massive improvements in air quality over the past several decades \u2014 progress that was made without any help from electric buses, cars or taxis, and while 'gas guzzlers' continued to dominate domestic car sales[22]. Air quality in most places today is above, or well above, the government's standards for safety. 2) A (surely even more evil!) friend shared these comments on it: I agree 100% with this article, as it makes the point I have been trying to make for much of the last decade: In the U.S., cars have been getting cleaner every single year since at least 1973 or 1974. Despite many more cars, driven many more miles, air quality has therefore kept improving every single year for essentially 45 years in a row. A brand new gasoline car -- or diesel, as they have the exact same pollution standard they need to meet in the U.S., since 2009 -- today emits so little that if it were deployed in certain (sub-sections of) metropolitan areas, it would actually clean the air: the air coming out of the tailpipe is cleaner than what's being ingested through the car's air filter. But let's look at what's going on with the U.S. automotive fleet: We have approximately 253 million cars on the road in the U.S. New light vehicle sales in the U.S. has been around 17 million per year for the last couple of years, and the consensus estimates for 2019 are somewhere between 16.5 and 17.0 million. That means that in a flat overall market, the fleet would 'turn over' in 15 years (253 / 17). But what cars are actually turned over? As a practical and statistical matter, the 17 million new cars sold into the U.S. market are replacing the oldest cars on the road. Those are the dirtiest ones. Most of the ones replaced are cars from the 1990s and 1980s -- and even 1970s, still on the road. You know this because you can literally smell them, and sometimes even visibly see the pollution coming out of the tailpipe. You know it if you're in New York City and one happens to be idling next to you in traffic. But why do people keep driving around in those cars from the 1990s, 1980s, and even the 1970s? The answer is, mostly, cost. It's simply too expensive to buy a new car. While you can pick up a decent new car for around $15,000 after the most extreme dealer discounts in the market today, let's call $20,000 a more universal number for a broader range of body styles and sizes. Everyone in the U.S. can get into a very decent car for somewhere in the $15,000 to $20,000 today. The problem is that only a decade ago, that number was closer to $10,000 -- not $15,000 to $20,000. And not long before then, it was $8,000 or somewhere around there. New cars have simply become less affordable. As a consequence, people keep the oldest cars, that pollute way over 100 times more than a new car. In some cases even 1,000 or 10,000 times more. What's driving those increasing costs for new cars? Ironically, pollution controls. They are expensive, costing several thousand dollars more per car. Plus, another thing that I will get into in a moment. I am going to use a few conveniently 'round' numbers and decimal points here, but they are necessary to prove a point. Let's say that it it costs $1,000 per car to reduce pollution by 99.999%. Then, to get to a 99.9999% reduction, it would have to cost $5,000 per car -- and incremental $4,000 for that extra decimal point. How many people could buy a new car for $12,000 net vs those who would replace their old car if the new car was $16,000? The answer: A lot more people buy a new car if it's $12,000 vs when it would be $16,000. The difference is that the $12,000 car reduces pollution (compared to the 1997 Ford Taurus they're trading in) by 99.999%, but the otherwise identical car, priced at $16,000, reduces it by $99.9999%. If the environmental goal is to reduce total pollution, you will want more people replacing their old cars -- even if it's only a 99.999% reduction instead of 99.9999%. Stated differently: If you make new car pollution controls expensive, then people keep their old cars around, and you end up with more pollution -- not less. That's why it would actually be a hugely positive thing for the environment to avoid tightening pollution standards going forward. Freeze them at the current level instead. That would avoid that $16,000 car today to bump up its price to $20,000 or more in the next couple of years. Because that's what is about to happen if current U.S. Federal and state policies don't change. Back to that other thing that is also driving up cost of a basic gasoline car: Paying for electric car subsidies. In California and a few other states, the states have set quotas for electric car sales. Seeing as those quotas are higher than the free-market demand, the automakers are effectively forced to sell them below cost. That's why you see such cheap EV car leases in states such as California, for example. So, automakers are having to internally subsidize EV car sales -- mostly far more expensive cars than those who are used to replace 20+ year old pollution stinkers. A new EV is far more likely to replace a 3 year old BMW 3-series or Mercedes C300 that's come off a lease. Actually, the most common trade-in for an EV is a Toyota Prius. In other words, that new subsidized EV is not replacing an old stinker -- it's replacing the next-cleanest car on the road. All of those internal automaker subsidies come from somewhere. The automakers are not just going to eat those losses. Those subsidies simply get added to the price of a 'regular' basic gasoline or diesel car. That means that $16,000 car is now $17,000 or $18,000, all other things equal. And that means that some guy in South Dakota or Florida who thought he was going to replace his 1995 Toyota Corolla with a new 2019 Toyota Corolla hybrid, can't afford to do it. He can't both afford to subsidize a Silicon Valley billionaire buying his fifth Tesla (which replaced his fourth Tesla), and also buy his own replacement for his 1995 Toyota Corolla. So he's left with driving his old car, which would pollute 1,000 or 10,000 times more than a 2019 Corolla hybrid. Increasing pollution controls on a new car today is simply self-defeating: If you increase them too much, then fewer and fewer people can afford buying a new car to replace the oldest cars on the road today. The only sensible solution is to freeze pollution standards at today's already most stringent level, and to cease forcing the automakers add to the price of their cheapest cars for the purpose of internally subsidizing more expensive electric cars. That's how you maximize clean air, while still not shrinking the overall size of the automotive fleet. An incredible story from a former SolarCity employeeIt would be hard to find a better example of one of the major reasons why I run this Tesla email list: the incredible information, analysis and insights I get from people on it. Here's an email I received recently from someone I'd never heard from before (shared with permission - and a few tweaks to maintain his anonymity). While some parts of his story are well known, overall he paints a detailed and damning picture of Musk's delusion and deception that I've never seen before, at least to this degree: I worked for SolarCity/Tesla for a number of years in solar system sales. I left the company late last year because of the drastic changes Tesla made to the solar business[23]. As publicly disclosed, this included eliminating all direct sales channels, which reduced the sales force from 4,000 salespeople to only about 60 inside sales reps in a Las Vegas call center to service the entire country. Musk also conducted an experiment by tasking the vehicle reps in Tesla stores to sell both cars and solar systems but that didn't work (of course this move was moot after many stores were closed a few months later). Finally, Musk hired a new executive from Amazon who had no experience in the solar industry to run the energy business right before I left. The latest rumored strategy I've heard to reignite the solar business is that Tesla will somehow be introducing a solar panel that is priced at about 50% per watt below the rest of the market. I can't imagine how that is possible. I suspect it's just more reality-distortion pandering to the existing employee base to keep them engaged. When Tesla acquired SolarCity, the company had about a 42% market share of the residential solar market. I suspect that share has now dwindled to low single digits. At its peak, the solar business was about $750 million in annual revenue; I suspect it's now less than $200 million, if that. Contrast this reality with Musk's multiple public statements to employees and investors that he expected Tesla's 'solar business' to be bigger than the car business in 10 years. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. At that time, the solar business had already been severely cut back and the car business was on pace to reach a $20 billion revenue annual run rate. Thus, for the solar business to have even a remote chance of catching the car business, the car business would have to contract and the solar business would have to miraculously reverse its severe revenue decline and grow 1,000% per year. This struck me as vintage Steve Jobs-like reality distortion. The new sales strategy is to mainly focus on cross-selling solar systems to Tesla owners who own homes. This certainly makes sense, but severely limits the addressable market and cedes the lion's share of the market to others. When I left, Solar Roof installations were a nothing burger. As far as I could tell, there were maybe 20 installed, many of which had been installed on current and former Tesla executive's homes. By the way, coverage of Tesla[24]'s solar business often erroneously makes it sound like Tesla manufactures its own solar panels. It is public information that all the panels Tesla installed are mostly made by Panasonic, plus panels from a few other manufactures from time to time. The inverters are provided mainly by SolarEdge, Delta and ABB. Powerwall is of course made by Tesla. In a follow-up email, he continued: My information is a little dated, so things could have changed. But everything I shared is fact based, true and based on conversations with former employees who worked there for a few months after I left. You can look up the name of the executive hired from Amazon in Tesla press releases. I think he was hired around June 2018. I don't know if the low-cost solar panels ever materialized, but I suspect that was wishful thinking or the former employee who told me about it got his story wrong. That said, if you go back and look at the investor presentation that justified the acquisition of SolarCity[25] I'm sure you will see that Tesla overpromised and underdelivered. They did promise investors $155 million in savings (synergy) by eliminating 'duplicative sales channels' and SG...They certainly delivered on that promise. The part about Musk going on record that the solar business would eventually surpass the car business is absolutely true. I personally heard him say that multiple times. I'm not sure how relevant any of this is to bolstering the case for shorting Tesla since the solar business is such a small part of Tesla and contributes a relatively small amount of revenue and profit (if any). In addition, many of us believed the real impetus for the acquisition was for Elon to save his own wealth and that of the other two co-founders who were Musk's first cousins - Lyndon Rive (CEO) and Peter Rive (CTO). You may know that Musk himself was SolarCity's largest shareholder with 23% of the stock. In addition, Tesla as I recall had purchased more than $100 million in SolarCity bonds over the years. SolarCity was on track to lose a billion dollars and probably would have gone bankrupt or been sold at a huge discount had Tesla not come to the rescue. [I just did some reading to refresh my memory on the SolarCity acquisition[26]. Tesla announced it on June 21, 2016, when its stock closed at $219.61, valuing SC at $2.6 billion. Its stock dropped 10.5% the next day to close at $196.66, so the market correctly viewed this as a bad deal for Tesla, I suspect mainly because Tesla roughly doubled its debt load by taking on $2.93 billion of SC's net debt. By the time the deal closed on Nov. 21, 2016, the stock was at $184.52, which means that, at least according to one article I read, Tesla issued $2.04 billion in stock for the deal. I'm not sure which number is right. Here is Tesla's lengthy blog post on Nov. 1, 2016 defending the deal:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-and-solarcity\">https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-and-solarcity</url>[27]. In it is this doozy: 'The transaction is expected to be additive to Tesla's cash balance. SolarCity increased its cash from Q2 to Q3 2016 and expects to increase it further in Q4 2016. We expect SolarCity to add more than half a billion dollars in cash to Tesla's balance sheet over the next 3 years.'] The post An incredible story from a former SolarCity employee[28] appeared first on ValueWalk[29].

I'm Terry Gross. Cybersecurity, cyberwar and the rise of the military Internet complex is the subject of the new book \"@War\" by my guest, Shane Harris. His book reports on how intelligence agencies are working to defend us against cyberattacks. But he also reports on how American intelligence agencies, sometimes with the cooperation of American corporations, are trying to dominate cyberspace and use it to spy on other countries and how those efforts are changing the Internet in fundamental ways and not always for the better. Harris covers intelligence and national security for The Daily Beast and is the author of an earlier book called \"The Watchers: The Rise Of America's Surveillance State.\" Shane Harris, welcome to FRESH AIR. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANE HARRIS:  Thank you. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TERRY GROSS:  Let's start with what you describe as the military Internet complex. What is it? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, the military Internet complex is an alliance - formal and informal really - between the U.S. military and the intelligence community and principally the National Security Agency - which is our largest intelligence agency - and large American corporations to include defense contractors who work for the government principally and build weapons systems for the government, but also increasingly technology companies like Google and Facebook and Yahoo that are responsible for providing information - information about people in the world - to the intelligence community who own and operate much of the Internet infrastructure in this country and around the world. </p><p>And what I mean by this alliance is that it is principally in the business of monitoring computer systems and monitoring the world's networks for threats. And principally in the book, I write about threats from hackers in other countries, but also in the United States. And this alliance has been set up largely for the purposes of defending computer networks in America, but also waging offensive operations on computer networks mainly overseas. It's something that's been done more in the shadows, but this alliance really has forged for the purpose of essentially trying to operate in cyberspace as if it were a battlefield, as if it were on land or in the sea or in the air. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So before we get deeper into this relationship between the Internet companies and the military, has that been changed by the Edward Snowden <person><nameText>leaks? </nameText></person></p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  I think it has been changed. I think it's actually been strained by the Edward Snowden <person><nameText>leaks. </nameText></person>Mainly what we're seeing with the strain is in the relationship between government and principally the intelligence agencies and the tech companies like the Googles and the Facebooks and Yahoo. Those companies, we now know from the documents Snowden leaked, had been cooperating with the government in handing over - because they were forced to do so really - large amounts of information about their customers. We've learned a lot more about what the NSA was doing secretly with some of this data and ways that it was even trying to secretly hack into the systems of the companies that it was forcing to hand over data. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So let's back up a little bit. When this cooperative relationship was formed between tech companies, defense contractors and the intelligence agencies - you write that the government views protecting whole industries as the best way to protect cyberspace. Why? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, the fear that the government has is that what we call critical infrastructure in this country - by which we mean things like our electrical power grid, water treatment facilities, big public utilities, large financial computer systems, the stock exchange, the systems that run large banks - the government fears that those computer systems are vulnerable to hackers and that an intruder could get in and steal data, manipulate data or possibly even damage the physical infrastructure that is connected via the Internet to some of these vulnerable systems. </p><p>And so what the government has tried to do is prioritize which industries and which sectors of the economy are the most at risk, and then go to the companies in those industries and try and share information that the intelligence agencies know about hackers with those companies. So, for instance, the government is trying to push information about hackers who were trying to break into banks and to share that with banks so that the banks can then take that data, which is information, by the way, that's gleaned from espionage, from our spies going into foreign computer systems and seeing what other hackers are up to, pushing that information out to the bank so that the banks can in turn take that and incorporate it into their own defensive strategies and better protect themselves. </p><p>And so the government has tried to divide up these critical infrastructures and essentially provide information when it can to those businesses so that they can protect themselves and the government does not have to go in and set up its own equipment on those networks to try and defend them for them. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  What have you found out about what these meetings are like, these secret meetings between, I guess, CEOs of these companies and members of the intelligence community? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  They can be very tense and often I think sort of a little spooky and exciting. There's a couple stories that I like particularly that kind of illuminate this. The NSA has been in the practice of granting temporary security clearances, sometimes for as short as one day, to the CEOs of big tech companies. The CEO of Google, Sergey Brin, got one of these at a meeting that was held some years ago. And what it does is it sort of, you know, brings CEOs into the secret tent and says, OK, we're going to show you some stuff about hackers, threats to your networks and other networks in the United States. But you can't tell anyone; it's a secret. Of course if you do divulge the information, we can prosecute you. And I think it sort of has the effect, on the one hand, of making these CEOs feel like they're sort of part of a very important official mission and also scaring them, perhaps, and frightening them into thinking that their networks are very vulnerable and they better do something to protect them because national security is at stake. </p><p>There've been also tenser meetings. I write in the book about the former director of the National Security Agency, which is sort of the - the NSA is the center of activity in the government in cybersecurity - this is a man named Keith Alexander who, a number of years ago, went up to New York and met with top executives from a number of big banks and said that the banks were at great risk for being hacked, which, of course, they understood and they knew already. And that what he would like to do would be to come and actually install monitoring equipment on some of their networks to be able to help them fend off hackers. And the executives - I talked to some who were there - thought this was outrageous, the idea that they would allow a spy agency into financial networks and look into the account data of their customers. And they sort of looked at Alexander like, you know, you must be crazy to think that we would ever let you do something like that. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  And I should point out here that the banking industry has had a lot of cyberattacks - I mean, big problems. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  They really have. And it's particularly lately one of the more high-profile ones was there was a major breach of the computer systems at J.P. Morgan. This really - that particular event actually frightened a lot of security people in Washington because the banks have been generally assumed to have the best computer defenses in place because they're dealing with money. I mean, they're dealing with people's account data as well. And I think when hackers got into those J.P. Morgan systems, it really sort of rattled people. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So getting back to the military Internet complex, this seemingly cooperative relationship between private industry and the intelligence agency, you write that the NSA has helped companies find weaknesses in their products that leave them vulnerable to cyberattacks. But at the same time, the NSA has sometimes paid companies not to fix some of those vulnerabilities. What's that about? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  This really gets to the heart of - there are two conflicting missions within the NSA. On the one hand, the NSA's mission is to protect information and protect computer networks so that the data - and in many cases the government secrets inside official networks - can't be stolen. On the other hand, the NSA is a spying agency. Its job is to go out and try and break into computer systems in other countries and steal information about our adversaries. </p><p>The technology that the NSA is spying on is largely commercial technology. So, you know, we use Microsoft in this country for our operating systems in millions of computers. People use it in other countries as well. There's telecommunications equipment that's sold in this country that's also used in foreign countries that we're trying to spy on. So this sort of off-the-shelf technology is something that the NSA wants to know how to be able to manipulate and get into. If it finds ways into that technology that are not widely known that sort of are hidden flaws and vulnerabilities that it could take advantage of to spy on it, it doesn't necessarily want that information to be put out there because if that hole were patched, the NSA couldn't get into it. </p><p>So there's this conflicting mission of on the one hand, the NSA trying to ramp up cybersecurity and defend information, on the other hand, trying to keep computer systems around the world just weak enough, at least maybe in the places that they know about, so that they can manipulate them and perhaps have, you know, exclusive or kind of privileged access to them when they want them. Those two missions are very much at conflict with each other. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Yeah, and in addition to the NSA preserving some of those vulnerabilities so it can get access to information, there are other possible consequences of leaving those vulnerabilities. What are those consequences? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, one is that the NSA won't be the only one that finds out about the vulnerability. So there was a case number of years ago that I think illustrates this point pretty compellingly. There was a standard that was being developed for encryption technology in the United States. And encryption is just the - it's a way of scrambling data so that if I send you an email and we're sending it to each other encrypted, only you and I can unscramble it because we have the keys to decipher the encryption. </p><p>The NSA got involved with the writing of an encryption standard that eventually was widely used in a commercial product. And it inserted weaknesses into that recipe, if you like, that only it knew about - or that only the NSA thought that they knew about. That encryption was then pushed out with this - kind of this weakness in it. Pretty soon after it went on the market, smart technologists started looking at this algorithm and saying there's something wrong with this. There are flaws here that don't make any sense. And it wasn't widely known outside that community, but a smart hacker in another country could catch on to that and see that the algorithm had a weakness and also exploit that as well. So NSA weakening this encryption algorithm ostensibly to make sure that it had the ability to decipher messages of what it would say are the bad guys - if it ever needed to do that because the bad guys could be using this encryption just the same way you and I might - ended up weakening it in a way that those bad - those other bad guys could've found out about it. I think that's a good example of how, by weakening something in the name of security, the NSA is also undermining the very security of that technology and putting all of us at greater risk. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  If you're just joining us, my guest is Shane Harris, author of the new book \"@ War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" And he covers intelligence and national security for The Daily Beast. Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TERRY GROSS:  This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Shane Harris, author of the new book \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" And he recently moved to The Daily Beast where he's now a senior writer covering intelligence and national security. </p><p>Do internet companies as well as companies that rely on huge computer network systems like the banking industry - do they feel they need the NSA to warn them about cyber threats and to help them when they are under attack? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Increasingly they do not feel like they need the NSA's help. And this is something that actually surprised me a lot when I started researching the book. I think seven or eight years ago, if you'd gone to some of these companies and - they would have been - many of them would've been very new companies at the time - they would have been very surprised to find out how pervasive, for instance, cyber espionage by China against U.S. corporations is. They would have been, I think, a lot - very nervous about financial crime and financial computer hacking that's emanating largely from Russia. </p><p>In that time period, though, in the past five, six, seven years, they've gotten a lot smarter about detecting these threats. I tell one story in the book where a senior FBI official who was responsible for cybersecurity issues for the Bureau wanted to have a meeting with a number of bank executives and say, OK, we are going to basically open the file to you guys and be good partners here and show you all of the different criminal rings and hacker groups and schemes that we're tracking right now that we see targeting the banking industry - your industry. And effectively the banks looked at this and said, this is great, but we already knew almost all of this because they had started to open their own cybersecurity divisions. They're hiring outside consultants. They're just getting much better at monitoring their own networks. </p><p>One company I write about also near the end of the book is a company called Lockheed Martin, which is a big defense contractor. Eight years ago, they were a target of a major hack by China. And that event was one thing that actually started setting off alarm bells in the Pentagon and leading to more of this cooperation between government and industry over hackers. Today Lockheed Martin will say that they are tracking as many different hacker groups as the NSA is. They've become almost like an intelligence organization in their own right. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Is there a revolving door for cybersecurity experts between the intelligence agencies and corporations? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  There's a very big revolving door, and it's constantly spinning. You see it at really almost all different levels. I mean, I've talked to people who went to college and studied computer science on scholarships that were paid for by the National Security Agency. They got out of college. They did an obligatory four-year working stint with the NSA, and then they left to go out to California and start private cybersecurity companies in Silicon Valley. </p><p>You see it at very high senior levels. I mean, the individual who runs the cybersecurity business for Lockheed Martin, this huge corporation, is a former military officer. The former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, a few months ago started his own private cybersecurity consulting business, for which he is reportedly charging clients anywhere from $600,000 to $1 million a month. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Whoa. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Yeah, it's an astonishing number, to basically provide them with the expertise and the technology based on that expertise to defend their networks against hackers, against foreign threats. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So if your company's large computer network is being hacked, say, by Chinese hackers, what if the government is behind it and you - your company wants to fight back? That would mean your company is fighting against a country, which gets into really odd territory and really new territory. What law or regulations, guidelines, whatever address that? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, right now if you are -  let's take a bank. And you find out that your networks are being penetrated or hackers in China are trying to break in. It is illegal under U.S. law for that bank to hack back against the source of the intrusion, to try and take those computers off-line, or to break into those computers to find out what information they may have stolen. </p><p>There is a significant debate going on right now, largely among national security lawyers, about whether the law needs to be changed to allow companies to do that hack-back in some way. The fear here is that if you loosen those restrictions that what will happen is that you'll get into a situation where a bank suddenly gets into a cyberwar with an nation state and then things could spiral out of control very quickly. The companies will say, we are under relentless assault from these foreign hacker groups. If the government is not going to step in and address that - by which we mean go out and get those guys, arrest them, take their computers off-line - then what are we as these companies supposed to do? And they all ask. And I think they have a legitimate concern here. </p><p>Are we supposed to just sit here and take it and just try and build higher walls and better defenses? You know, people draw an analogy to the principle of self-defense. I mean, if someone breaks into your home and tries to rob you, the law does make room for you to defend yourself in your own home. So a lot of these companies are asking, why, if someone is breaking into my computer network and stealing my property, why should I have to just sit there and take it? Why can't I take some sort of retaliatory response? </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  What's one of the worst cyberattacks against, you know, a vast computer network in the U.S., a cyberattack launched from another country? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Probably some of the worst if we're measuring them in terms of damage done might be some of the recent attacks on big retailers like Target and Home Depot, which ended up stealing millions of people's credit card information and debit card information. Now, that's bad in terms of the number of people affected, but what we see there, too, is that the banks are able to, I think, recover from that pretty quickly. So if your credit was compromised then, you know, you're not really going to suffer from that. I mean, if there are fraudulent charges that are made to your account, the banks cannot hold you liable for them. And you're going to kind of go on about your life and get a new credit card. </p><p>I think, you know, where we've seen the much more damaging ones though is when you're talking about attacks by - particularly by China and the Chinese military - aimed at American corporations and stealing their commercial data and their proprietary trade secrets. So there was a fairly famous case that has actually been made public now because there's an indictment in it where the Chinese government hacked into a company called SolarWorld. SolarWorld makes solar panels, cells and related equipment - and was just robbing the company blind of its proprietary information, its pricing information and using that to then give to Chinese competitors so that they would have a leg up on SolarWorld in negotiations. So that was one way where it's been really damaging. </p><p>You know, another actually, really is - curiously doesn't involve a foreign hacker. The FBI, a number of years ago, was launching a sting operation against a pretty famous hacker group called Anonymous, which had decided that they were going to go after a company based in Texas called Stratfor. Stratfor is basically a publishing company. It writes really detailed analyses about geopolitics. And the Anonymous hackers believed that Stratfor was sort of a quasi-government agency and aligned with the CIA. So they started stealing information from it. And the FBI was watching this happen and notified Stratfor and said, listen, we've got this situation under control. We can see that they're inside your networks. Let us handle this. We want to gather information about what they're doing. Well, the hackers ultimately made off with and destroyed a huge amount of the company's material, these analyses that it sells. It's a subscription-based company. And it really financially wrecked the company. So that was another instance where, you know, on a small scale because it was just this one organization, but it demonstrates that if somebody wants to get inside your network and steal or destroy your property that you really rely upon to run your business, they can do tremendous damage. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Shane Harris will be back in the second half of the show. His new book is called \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TERRY GROSS:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Shane Harris, who is now senior correspondent for The Daily Beast, covering intelligence and national security. He's the author of the new book \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" It's about cyberwar, cybersecurity and electronic surveillance. Another thing you write about is how the NSA has installed malware into tens of thousands of computers and servers around the world. How does it do it? Why does it do it? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, it has a system that is referred to in some of these classified documents we've seen - there's something called turbine, which - basically, they've developed ways to go out onto networks all around the world and detect what operating systems computers are running. And if there's a known vulnerability in that operating system, the NSA can essentially inject that computer with a piece of malicious software that can allow it to monitor the computer - in some cases, take it over. </p><p>And why it's doing this in foreign countries is because it wants to sort of have these little access points or these sort of, you know, toe holds into computers around the world in countries that it wants to monitor, that it wants to be able to get inside of their government agencies or their corporations. So the NSA does - you know, it's a spy - it's an intelligence agency. It spies on other government. It spies on companies in other countries. And essentially, all of these infections, if you like, are sort of like little watchtowers or little listening posts that it's installing all around the world. </p><p>Once inside a computer system, though, to spy on it, it's not that much of a leap to do something to actually try and damage the computer itself, damage the data inside of it. Or if it's a computer that's connected to, let's say, a piece of physical infrastructure, like a power generator or a turbine in an electrical station, to actually cause that physical - that actual device connected to it to behave erratically and possibly to break. So all of these different points that the NSA has installed are for the purposes of monitoring and, if necessary, actually attacking and potentially causing physical damage via a cyberattack. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Are the flaws that you're describing that are built into certain computers that are exported from United States - are those flaws built in by the NSA, or are those flaws that the NSA knows about that the NSA wants maintained? Like, I don't know how much agency the NSA has in this. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Right. Principally, what we're talking about in these cases are flaws that the agency has discovered. So in these infected computers around the world, these are particular flaws in the software or the operating systems of computers that the NSA knows about. And the ones that it's most interested in are the ones that only the NSA knows about. </p><p>So there's something called a zero-day. A zero-day is a flaw in software or an operating system that is only known to the individual who discovered it. And effectively, there is no patch or defense for it. So if you were to try to exploit that vulnerability today, the program - the person who designed the system would have zero days to defend against it. There are researchers - hackers - who scour technology all around the world looking for these vulnerabilities. And they're really quite prized because it's not an easy thing to find a flaw that hasn't been discovered and patched before. </p><p>The NSA actually purchases this information from private hackers and is the single-largest purchaser, in fact - that we know of - of these zero-day flaws. And it does this because it wants to find those hidden, secret ways into computer systems and to keep that information to itself, which makes a lot of sense if you're looking at it from the NSA's perspective. If their job is to try and find novel and clandestine ways into computer systems, it wants to find back doors and cracks in the system that are known only to it because once that information gets out that, system can be patched. And then the NSA - then the doors close to the NSA. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Can the NSA be sure, after buying zero-day information, that it's the only agency that knows about that flaw? Do they buy exclusive rights to the zero-day information because if they don't, it's not really a zero-day thing anymore because more people know about it? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Correct. And I don't think that they can know for sure. And I think that they presume that a lot of the information that they buy is perishable - that eventually it might be discovered before the NSA even chooses to act on the flaw. So could just be something that they have the bank, and then if, you know, two or three more people find out about it, we'll scratch it off the list. It's not really proprietary to us anymore. </p><p>There's sort of a gray market for this information. You know, if you knew how to get there, you can actually go online and contact a hacker on the deep web or the dark web, if you like, and find somebody who sells this kind of information. I think that there are some market forces at play here - such that if you are a known seller of zero-day flaws, you're probably not going to get much repeat business if you're found to be selling those flaws to multiple customers. But the NSA knows that this information is really quite perishable. It's one of the reasons why it stockpiles so much of it because you - you know, if you have 2,000 known flaws, you know, a percentage of those might be no longer exploitable only to you, you know, three months from now. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  While we're on the subject of all this, the military has been hacked. What's one of the worst hacks that the military has faced? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Probably the worst one that they faced was about five or six years ago. There was a really unsettling event that - this was in 2000 - actually, 2008, this was. There was a classified computer network used by U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And one day - it was a Friday, I believe - the people who monitor this network started noticing that there was a piece of software inside the network - a piece of malware - that wasn't supposed to be there. And it was actually sending out a beacon, which meant that it was this device inside the network, and it was trying to reach out and contact some other computer somewhere in the world on the Internet. </p><p>And this frightened people in the military quite a bit because the network that this malware was inside is not actually connected to Internet. It's such a secret and sensitive network that it is, as they say, air-gapped. It's separated physically from the rest of the Internet. So how in the world did that get in there? </p><p>The general theory now is that probably there was a soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan who inserted a thumb drive - one of those little USB sticks - that he may have picked up someplace, put it into a computer. And it had this malware on it, and it got loose inside of the network. This was an event that really frightened a lot of people in the military. The White House was made aware of it because it demonstrated that even if you have a network that is not physically connected to the Internet, there is still potentially a way for an adversary to infect that network. </p><p>It's not clear whether or not - if, in fact, it was spread by a USB - whether this was a foreign intelligence agency that, you know, planted it on this person or threw it in a parking lot, and somebody picked it up. But it demonstrated there was a way to get into these networks, even if you do everything physically possible to try to make them safe. That was probably one of the - in a military system, one of the worst instances. It did not end up compromising military operations, and no classified information was stolen. But it was a real wake-up call to people in the Pentagon. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  I think ever since the Edward Snowden <person><nameText>leaks, </nameText></person>a lot of Americans have been very suspicious of the NSA. But you write in the book, the NSA is not the enemy. Are there things you want to remind Americans of that the NSA is doing that is really very important to our security as individuals and as a nation? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Yes. I mean, the NSA is the biggest source of expertise in the government right now of people who know how to defend computer networks and are very good at that job. And that's a vitally important mission. We depend upon - we - citizens of the United States depend upon the Defense Department to protect us from foreign invaders. We would never imagine that if, you know, enemy planes were flying over the United States and dropping bombs, that the military would not respond to that. And within that context, the NSA does play a role for helping to defend computer networks in the United States. And we should be glad that we have that expertise there. </p><p>But what I argue is that the NSA has tried to take on, I think, too vast and too pervasive of a role and has fundamentally, in many ways, weakened all of our security, which I write a lot about in the book. In this desire to protect us, there's kind of a conflicting mission there. But we should understand that, I mean, ultimately, I think, you know, the agency is, I think, filled with good, very smart people who believe that they have a very important mission to help defend our networks. </p><p>What we need to do is sort of - is put the right constraints on the agency and the - and define more clearly what that agency's roles actually are because, heretofore, I think they've largely been made to - left to make those decisions on their own. And I think, arguably, the NSA has accrued too much power and too much authority over that vital mission. But, you know, we should remember that they're - effectively, I think that they're there to try and help. And we need good laws and good regulations and more transparency to understand how we can best use the expertise of the NSA and make sure that that authority and that power is not abused. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  If you're just joining us, my guest is Shane Harris. He's the author of the new book \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex,\" and he covers intelligence for The Daily Beast. Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TERRY GROSS:  This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Shane Harris, author of the new book \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" And he covers cybersecurity and national intelligence for The Daily Beast. Let's talk about how cyberwar played a part in the war in Iraq - techniques that hadn't been used before. What were some of those techniques? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, in 2007, people will recall that the so-called surge began - the Iraq troop surge in which tens of thousands of more combat forces were put into Iraq. A little-noticed part of that military strategy was that the NSA developed a way to collect every electronic communication that was moving through Iraq - every cell phone call, every text message, every email that was sent. And they did this by physically tapping into, principally, the cellular phone networks in Iraq, which were really ballooning and blossoming at that time, and basically collect every piece of communication. And what they were trying to do here and what they did quite successfully was to hack into the cell phones and the computers that were used by insurgent fighters and members of al-Qaida in Iraq, which, of course, morphed later into the group ISIS that the U.S. is fighting in Iraq and Syria now. </p><p>The NSA's sort of elite hackers found ways to break into those phones, listen to the conversations. They sent fake text messages to some fighters, posing as their fellow fighters, telling them to go to a certain location to go plant a bomb. And when they got there, American troops were waiting for them. They found out ways to track people's cell phones even when they were turned off, using cell phones as sort of a tracking beacon so that it could figure out - if they knew a particular fighter or a bomb maker, they could follow him to where he was hiding out. They could round up his associates. The NSA actually infiltrated online websites - these forums that are used by jihadists - and planted malicious software in them so that when some of the people going to that site would go and would click on certain documents or read certain pages, their machines would become infected and that would allow the NSA to sort of hone in on them. And the agency gave all of this intelligence that it was generating to combat soldiers on the ground, particularly with the - what's called the Joint Special Operations Command, which are sort of the elite commandos in Iraq. And this sort of amazing, real-time cycle of intelligence began to take hold, whereby the NSA, which had basically hacked into the entire network infrastructure of Iraq, was able to gather information, send out fake information, send out malware and then physically locate where these fighters were and understand how their networks were arranged. So who was in charge? Who was the chief bomb maker? Who were people taking orders from? And feed that information to the troops on the ground, who then either went and captured those individuals or killed them. And a number of people I interviewed for the book - and even David Petraeus, who was the commander of ground forces in Iraq - has said this publicly. Credit that intelligence operation - that cyber operation - with being a deciding factor in turning around the tide of the war in favor of the American forces during the surge. It's credited with removing from the battlefield, either because they were captured or killed, at least 4,000 fighters and ultimately lead to us being able to dismantle al-Qaida in Iraq and at least for that period in time, you know, I think was arguably a U.S. military victory. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So what happens when an enemy could do the same thing against us? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  They would be able to find out where our forces are. And they would be able to find out how we're communicating. And that's something that the military is very concerned about. We are not the only country that has these kinds of capabilities. We have vast capabilities and they're quite extensive, but the governments of Russia, of China - Israel has really sophisticated cyber capabilities. What the military worries about now is that if we ever go into a conventional war with another country - let's pick China, which is an improbable event, but let's say we were at war with China. They would be trying to hack in our systems, too. They would be trying to manipulate our communications. They would be trying to disable our infrastructure. </p><p>And the reason that so many countries are developing these cyber capabilities, one big reason is that they know that they cannot challenge us in a conventional military setting. China is - does not have a Navy that can go head-to-head with ours. What they can do and is much easier to do is build a cyber capability that they could use if we were ever to get into a conflict. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Are you assuming that we're using cyber capabilities against ISIS now? Because ISIS has really been relying on social media and the Internet for its propaganda, including its beheading videos. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Right. They've made great use of social media for recruitment and to spread their message out. ISIS is actually a fascinating case - and I've actually been looking into this and interviewing people in government in the past few days about it. ISIS has actually proven to be quite resilient to our cyber efforts. And the reason for that is that they have avoided using cell phones, radios, satellite phones. They've been very careful about when they post messages to Twitter to strip out the information that shows the geographic location where a photo was taken or a tweet was sent. They have figured out, in many ways, how we spy and how we monitor - or at least have assumed generally that we do make a great effort to spy on our adversaries' communications. </p><p>And it's worth remembering, too, that ISIS is the successor group to al-Qaida in Iraq, which is the group that we so effectively attacked using these cyber capabilities. So ISIS has really gone to school on U.S. cyberwarfare and is proving - actually, a number of officials of told me in the past two days, very difficult to track and to target with airstrikes because they're staying off the grid. They know that once they communicate with these digital and electronic technologies, they put themselves at greater risk of being discovered. So they've really taken steps to try and limit the amount - the degree to which they are communicating with each other. And it's making it harder to target them. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  But it does disable their ability to communicate? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Exactly. And that's the flip side of it. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Looking on the bright side. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  On the bright side, exactly. (Laughter)  It's harder, you know, just to imagine trying to go through your day without sending email and without being able to use the phone. So this is actually a situation that Osama bin Laden, I think, faced when he was hiding out in Abbottabad, in a house that did not have any connection to the Internet. There was no Internet service there. He had to rely on human couriers. And it's still not clear exactly how ISIS is communicating. But what we're hearing from intelligence officials is that, you know, they are limiting the way that they communicate. That certainly, though, is going to have - put constraints on what they're able to do. So there is a positive benefit to that. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So, you know, we've been talking about hacking and stuff. We just - we recently learned that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, which includes the National Weather Service, was hacked by China. Why would that be a target? Why is that a target? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  I think, in this case, because NOAA relies on information from sophisticated imaging satellites and weather satellites, that getting into NOAA would be a way of learning more about what our satellite technology is. That's one possibility. Also what we've seen is a pattern of hackers, perhaps, trying to get a foothold in one government agency and to try to use that as a launching point often into another agency that might be harder to get in through the front door of that organization. So it could be that the hackers wanted to get in to steal passwords and other credentials of NOAA employees, to then perhaps maybe imitate them and try and send communications to someone at another government agency, posing as this NOAA employee and trick them into downloading a piece of malware. </p><p>The thing that's fascinating and sort of confounding about Chinese cyber espionage is that it is so broad and so pervasive that I almost find myself thinking, what target haven't they tried to hit? And one of the reasons why I think the Chinese, in particular, are able to do this is they have just devoted so much manpower, so much human power. Thousands and thousands of hackers are believed to be just sort of spending their days in rotating shifts trying to hack into all manner of U.S. companies, government agencies. I do think it's sort of really a coup when someone gets into a government agency because they might have secret information and they're generally believed to be more well-protected, although, I think clearly, NOAA was not. But I think that China is looking for just as much intelligence as it can possibly gather about U.S. corporations and the U.S. government. And so I guess in a way, why not NOAA? </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Well, Shane Harris, thank you so much for talking with us. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Thanks, Terry. It was a real pleasure. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Shane Harris is the author of the new book \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" And he's senior correspondent for The Daily Beast, covering intelligence and national security.

I'm Terry Gross. Cybersecurity, cyberwar and the rise of the military Internet complex is the subject of the new book \"@War\" by my guest, Shane Harris. His book reports on how intelligence agencies are working to defend us against cyberattacks. But he also reports on how American intelligence agencies, sometimes with the cooperation of American corporations, are trying to dominate cyberspace and use it to spy on other countries and how those efforts are changing the Internet in fundamental ways and not always for the better. Harris covers intelligence and national security for The Daily Beast and is the author of an earlier book called \"The Watchers: The Rise Of America's Surveillance State.\" Shane Harris, welcome to FRESH AIR. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANE HARRIS:  Thank you. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TERRY GROSS:  Let's start with what you describe as the military Internet complex. What is it? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, the military Internet complex is an alliance - formal and informal really - between the U.S. military and the intelligence community and principally the National Security Agency - which is our largest intelligence agency - and large American corporations to include defense contractors who work for the government principally and build weapons systems for the government, but also increasingly technology companies like Google and Facebook and Yahoo that are responsible for providing information - information about people in the world - to the intelligence community who own and operate much of the Internet infrastructure in this country and around the world. </p><p>And what I mean by this alliance is that it is principally in the business of monitoring computer systems and monitoring the world's networks for threats. And principally in the book, I write about threats from hackers in other countries, but also in the United States. And this alliance has been set up largely for the purposes of defending computer networks in America, but also waging offensive operations on computer networks mainly overseas. It's something that's been done more in the shadows, but this alliance really has forged for the purpose of essentially trying to operate in cyberspace as if it were a battlefield, as if it were on land or in the sea or in the air. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So before we get deeper into this relationship between the Internet companies and the military, has that been changed by the Edward Snowden <person><nameText>leaks? </nameText></person></p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  I think it has been changed. I think it's actually been strained by the Edward Snowden <person><nameText>leaks. </nameText></person>Mainly what we're seeing with the strain is in the relationship between government and principally the intelligence agencies and the tech companies like the Googles and the Facebooks and Yahoo. Those companies, we now know from the documents Snowden leaked, had been cooperating with the government in handing over - because they were forced to do so really - large amounts of information about their customers. We've learned a lot more about what the NSA was doing secretly with some of this data and ways that it was even trying to secretly hack into the systems of the companies that it was forcing to hand over data. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So let's back up a little bit. When this cooperative relationship was formed between tech companies, defense contractors and the intelligence agencies - you write that the government views protecting whole industries as the best way to protect cyberspace. Why? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, the fear that the government has is that what we call critical infrastructure in this country - by which we mean things like our electrical power grid, water treatment facilities, big public utilities, large financial computer systems, the stock exchange, the systems that run large banks - the government fears that those computer systems are vulnerable to hackers and that an intruder could get in and steal data, manipulate data or possibly even damage the physical infrastructure that is connected via the Internet to some of these vulnerable systems. </p><p>And so what the government has tried to do is prioritize which industries and which sectors of the economy are the most at risk, and then go to the companies in those industries and try and share information that the intelligence agencies know about hackers with those companies. So, for instance, the government is trying to push information about hackers who were trying to break into banks and to share that with banks so that the banks can then take that data, which is information, by the way, that's gleaned from espionage, from our spies going into foreign computer systems and seeing what other hackers are up to, pushing that information out to the bank so that the banks can in turn take that and incorporate it into their own defensive strategies and better protect themselves. </p><p>And so the government has tried to divide up these critical infrastructures and essentially provide information when it can to those businesses so that they can protect themselves and the government does not have to go in and set up its own equipment on those networks to try and defend them for them. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  What have you found out about what these meetings are like, these secret meetings between, I guess, CEOs of these companies and members of the intelligence community? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  They can be very tense and often I think sort of a little spooky and exciting. There's a couple stories that I like particularly that kind of illuminate this. The NSA has been in the practice of granting temporary security clearances, sometimes for as short as one day, to the CEOs of big tech companies. The CEO of Google, Sergey Brin, got one of these at a meeting that was held some years ago. And what it does is it sort of, you know, brings CEOs into the secret tent and says, OK, we're going to show you some stuff about hackers, threats to your networks and other networks in the United States. But you can't tell anyone; it's a secret. Of course if you do divulge the information, we can prosecute you. And I think it sort of has the effect, on the one hand, of making these CEOs feel like they're sort of part of a very important official mission and also scaring them, perhaps, and frightening them into thinking that their networks are very vulnerable and they better do something to protect them because national security is at stake. </p><p>There've been also tenser meetings. I write in the book about the former director of the National Security Agency, which is sort of the - the NSA is the center of activity in the government in cybersecurity - this is a man named Keith Alexander who, a number of years ago, went up to New York and met with top executives from a number of big banks and said that the banks were at great risk for being hacked, which, of course, they understood and they knew already. And that what he would like to do would be to come and actually install monitoring equipment on some of their networks to be able to help them fend off hackers. And the executives - I talked to some who were there - thought this was outrageous, the idea that they would allow a spy agency into financial networks and look into the account data of their customers. And they sort of looked at Alexander like, you know, you must be crazy to think that we would ever let you do something like that. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  And I should point out here that the banking industry has had a lot of cyberattacks - I mean, big problems. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  They really have. And it's particularly lately one of the more high-profile ones was there was a major breach of the computer systems at J.P. Morgan. This really - that particular event actually frightened a lot of security people in Washington because the banks have been generally assumed to have the best computer defenses in place because they're dealing with money. I mean, they're dealing with people's account data as well. And I think when hackers got into those J.P. Morgan systems, it really sort of rattled people. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So getting back to the military Internet complex, this seemingly cooperative relationship between private industry and the intelligence agency, you write that the NSA has helped companies find weaknesses in their products that leave them vulnerable to cyberattacks. But at the same time, the NSA has sometimes paid companies not to fix some of those vulnerabilities. What's that about? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  This really gets to the heart of - there are two conflicting missions within the NSA. On the one hand, the NSA's mission is to protect information and protect computer networks so that the data - and in many cases the government secrets inside official networks - can't be stolen. On the other hand, the NSA is a spying agency. Its job is to go out and try and break into computer systems in other countries and steal information about our adversaries. </p><p>The technology that the NSA is spying on is largely commercial technology. So, you know, we use Microsoft in this country for our operating systems in millions of computers. People use it in other countries as well. There's telecommunications equipment that's sold in this country that's also used in foreign countries that we're trying to spy on. So this sort of off-the-shelf technology is something that the NSA wants to know how to be able to manipulate and get into. If it finds ways into that technology that are not widely known that sort of are hidden flaws and vulnerabilities that it could take advantage of to spy on it, it doesn't necessarily want that information to be put out there because if that hole were patched, the NSA couldn't get into it. </p><p>So there's this conflicting mission of on the one hand, the NSA trying to ramp up cybersecurity and defend information, on the other hand, trying to keep computer systems around the world just weak enough, at least maybe in the places that they know about, so that they can manipulate them and perhaps have, you know, exclusive or kind of privileged access to them when they want them. Those two missions are very much at conflict with each other. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Yeah, and in addition to the NSA preserving some of those vulnerabilities so it can get access to information, there are other possible consequences of leaving those vulnerabilities. What are those consequences? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, one is that the NSA won't be the only one that finds out about the vulnerability. So there was a case number of years ago that I think illustrates this point pretty compellingly. There was a standard that was being developed for encryption technology in the United States. And encryption is just the - it's a way of scrambling data so that if I send you an email and we're sending it to each other encrypted, only you and I can unscramble it because we have the keys to decipher the encryption. </p><p>The NSA got involved with the writing of an encryption standard that eventually was widely used in a commercial product. And it inserted weaknesses into that recipe, if you like, that only it knew about - or that only the NSA thought that they knew about. That encryption was then pushed out with this - kind of this weakness in it. Pretty soon after it went on the market, smart technologists started looking at this algorithm and saying there's something wrong with this. There are flaws here that don't make any sense. And it wasn't widely known outside that community, but a smart hacker in another country could catch on to that and see that the algorithm had a weakness and also exploit that as well. So NSA weakening this encryption algorithm ostensibly to make sure that it had the ability to decipher messages of what it would say are the bad guys - if it ever needed to do that because the bad guys could be using this encryption just the same way you and I might - ended up weakening it in a way that those bad - those other bad guys could've found out about it. I think that's a good example of how, by weakening something in the name of security, the NSA is also undermining the very security of that technology and putting all of us at greater risk. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  If you're just joining us, my guest is Shane Harris, author of the new book \"@ War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" And he covers intelligence and national security for The Daily Beast. Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TERRY GROSS:  This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Shane Harris, author of the new book \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" And he recently moved to The Daily Beast where he's now a senior writer covering intelligence and national security. </p><p>Do internet companies as well as companies that rely on huge computer network systems like the banking industry - do they feel they need the NSA to warn them about cyber threats and to help them when they are under attack? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Increasingly they do not feel like they need the NSA's help. And this is something that actually surprised me a lot when I started researching the book. I think seven or eight years ago, if you'd gone to some of these companies and - they would have been - many of them would've been very new companies at the time - they would have been very surprised to find out how pervasive, for instance, cyber espionage by China against U.S. corporations is. They would have been, I think, a lot - very nervous about financial crime and financial computer hacking that's emanating largely from Russia. </p><p>In that time period, though, in the past five, six, seven years, they've gotten a lot smarter about detecting these threats. I tell one story in the book where a senior FBI official who was responsible for cybersecurity issues for the Bureau wanted to have a meeting with a number of bank executives and say, OK, we are going to basically open the file to you guys and be good partners here and show you all of the different criminal rings and hacker groups and schemes that we're tracking right now that we see targeting the banking industry - your industry. And effectively the banks looked at this and said, this is great, but we already knew almost all of this because they had started to open their own cybersecurity divisions. They're hiring outside consultants. They're just getting much better at monitoring their own networks. </p><p>One company I write about also near the end of the book is a company called Lockheed Martin, which is a big defense contractor. Eight years ago, they were a target of a major hack by China. And that event was one thing that actually started setting off alarm bells in the Pentagon and leading to more of this cooperation between government and industry over hackers. Today Lockheed Martin will say that they are tracking as many different hacker groups as the NSA is. They've become almost like an intelligence organization in their own right. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Is there a revolving door for cybersecurity experts between the intelligence agencies and corporations? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  There's a very big revolving door, and it's constantly spinning. You see it at really almost all different levels. I mean, I've talked to people who went to college and studied computer science on scholarships that were paid for by the National Security Agency. They got out of college. They did an obligatory four-year working stint with the NSA, and then they left to go out to California and start private cybersecurity companies in Silicon Valley. </p><p>You see it at very high senior levels. I mean, the individual who runs the cybersecurity business for Lockheed Martin, this huge corporation, is a former military officer. The former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, a few months ago started his own private cybersecurity consulting business, for which he is reportedly charging clients anywhere from $600,000 to $1 million a month. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Whoa. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Yeah, it's an astonishing number, to basically provide them with the expertise and the technology based on that expertise to defend their networks against hackers, against foreign threats. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So if your company's large computer network is being hacked, say, by Chinese hackers, what if the government is behind it and you - your company wants to fight back? That would mean your company is fighting against a country, which gets into really odd territory and really new territory. What law or regulations, guidelines, whatever address that? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, right now if you are -  let's take a bank. And you find out that your networks are being penetrated or hackers in China are trying to break in. It is illegal under U.S. law for that bank to hack back against the source of the intrusion, to try and take those computers off-line, or to break into those computers to find out what information they may have stolen. </p><p>There is a significant debate going on right now, largely among national security lawyers, about whether the law needs to be changed to allow companies to do that hack-back in some way. The fear here is that if you loosen those restrictions that what will happen is that you'll get into a situation where a bank suddenly gets into a cyberwar with an nation state and then things could spiral out of control very quickly. The companies will say, we are under relentless assault from these foreign hacker groups. If the government is not going to step in and address that - by which we mean go out and get those guys, arrest them, take their computers off-line - then what are we as these companies supposed to do? And they all ask. And I think they have a legitimate concern here. </p><p>Are we supposed to just sit here and take it and just try and build higher walls and better defenses? You know, people draw an analogy to the principle of self-defense. I mean, if someone breaks into your home and tries to rob you, the law does make room for you to defend yourself in your own home. So a lot of these companies are asking, why, if someone is breaking into my computer network and stealing my property, why should I have to just sit there and take it? Why can't I take some sort of retaliatory response? </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  What's one of the worst cyberattacks against, you know, a vast computer network in the U.S., a cyberattack launched from another country? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Probably some of the worst if we're measuring them in terms of damage done might be some of the recent attacks on big retailers like Target and Home Depot, which ended up stealing millions of people's credit card information and debit card information. Now, that's bad in terms of the number of people affected, but what we see there, too, is that the banks are able to, I think, recover from that pretty quickly. So if your credit was compromised then, you know, you're not really going to suffer from that. I mean, if there are fraudulent charges that are made to your account, the banks cannot hold you liable for them. And you're going to kind of go on about your life and get a new credit card. </p><p>I think, you know, where we've seen the much more damaging ones though is when you're talking about attacks by - particularly by China and the Chinese military - aimed at American corporations and stealing their commercial data and their proprietary trade secrets. So there was a fairly famous case that has actually been made public now because there's an indictment in it where the Chinese government hacked into a company called SolarWorld. SolarWorld makes solar panels, cells and related equipment - and was just robbing the company blind of its proprietary information, its pricing information and using that to then give to Chinese competitors so that they would have a leg up on SolarWorld in negotiations. So that was one way where it's been really damaging. </p><p>You know, another actually, really is - curiously doesn't involve a foreign hacker. The FBI, a number of years ago, was launching a sting operation against a pretty famous hacker group called Anonymous, which had decided that they were going to go after a company based in Texas called Stratfor. Stratfor is basically a publishing company. It writes really detailed analyses about geopolitics. And the Anonymous hackers believed that Stratfor was sort of a quasi-government agency and aligned with the CIA. So they started stealing information from it. And the FBI was watching this happen and notified Stratfor and said, listen, we've got this situation under control. We can see that they're inside your networks. Let us handle this. We want to gather information about what they're doing. Well, the hackers ultimately made off with and destroyed a huge amount of the company's material, these analyses that it sells. It's a subscription-based company. And it really financially wrecked the company. So that was another instance where, you know, on a small scale because it was just this one organization, but it demonstrates that if somebody wants to get inside your network and steal or destroy your property that you really rely upon to run your business, they can do tremendous damage. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Shane Harris will be back in the second half of the show. His new book is called \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TERRY GROSS:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Shane Harris, who is now senior correspondent for The Daily Beast, covering intelligence and national security. He's the author of the new book \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" It's about cyberwar, cybersecurity and electronic surveillance. Another thing you write about is how the NSA has installed malware into tens of thousands of computers and servers around the world. How does it do it? Why does it do it? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, it has a system that is referred to in some of these classified documents we've seen - there's something called turbine, which - basically, they've developed ways to go out onto networks all around the world and detect what operating systems computers are running. And if there's a known vulnerability in that operating system, the NSA can essentially inject that computer with a piece of malicious software that can allow it to monitor the computer - in some cases, take it over. </p><p>And why it's doing this in foreign countries is because it wants to sort of have these little access points or these sort of, you know, toe holds into computers around the world in countries that it wants to monitor, that it wants to be able to get inside of their government agencies or their corporations. So the NSA does - you know, it's a spy - it's an intelligence agency. It spies on other government. It spies on companies in other countries. And essentially, all of these infections, if you like, are sort of like little watchtowers or little listening posts that it's installing all around the world. </p><p>Once inside a computer system, though, to spy on it, it's not that much of a leap to do something to actually try and damage the computer itself, damage the data inside of it. Or if it's a computer that's connected to, let's say, a piece of physical infrastructure, like a power generator or a turbine in an electrical station, to actually cause that physical - that actual device connected to it to behave erratically and possibly to break. So all of these different points that the NSA has installed are for the purposes of monitoring and, if necessary, actually attacking and potentially causing physical damage via a cyberattack. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Are the flaws that you're describing that are built into certain computers that are exported from United States - are those flaws built in by the NSA, or are those flaws that the NSA knows about that the NSA wants maintained? Like, I don't know how much agency the NSA has in this. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Right. Principally, what we're talking about in these cases are flaws that the agency has discovered. So in these infected computers around the world, these are particular flaws in the software or the operating systems of computers that the NSA knows about. And the ones that it's most interested in are the ones that only the NSA knows about. </p><p>So there's something called a zero-day. A zero-day is a flaw in software or an operating system that is only known to the individual who discovered it. And effectively, there is no patch or defense for it. So if you were to try to exploit that vulnerability today, the program - the person who designed the system would have zero days to defend against it. There are researchers - hackers - who scour technology all around the world looking for these vulnerabilities. And they're really quite prized because it's not an easy thing to find a flaw that hasn't been discovered and patched before. </p><p>The NSA actually purchases this information from private hackers and is the single-largest purchaser, in fact - that we know of - of these zero-day flaws. And it does this because it wants to find those hidden, secret ways into computer systems and to keep that information to itself, which makes a lot of sense if you're looking at it from the NSA's perspective. If their job is to try and find novel and clandestine ways into computer systems, it wants to find back doors and cracks in the system that are known only to it because once that information gets out that, system can be patched. And then the NSA - then the doors close to the NSA. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Can the NSA be sure, after buying zero-day information, that it's the only agency that knows about that flaw? Do they buy exclusive rights to the zero-day information because if they don't, it's not really a zero-day thing anymore because more people know about it? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Correct. And I don't think that they can know for sure. And I think that they presume that a lot of the information that they buy is perishable - that eventually it might be discovered before the NSA even chooses to act on the flaw. So could just be something that they have the bank, and then if, you know, two or three more people find out about it, we'll scratch it off the list. It's not really proprietary to us anymore. </p><p>There's sort of a gray market for this information. You know, if you knew how to get there, you can actually go online and contact a hacker on the deep web or the dark web, if you like, and find somebody who sells this kind of information. I think that there are some market forces at play here - such that if you are a known seller of zero-day flaws, you're probably not going to get much repeat business if you're found to be selling those flaws to multiple customers. But the NSA knows that this information is really quite perishable. It's one of the reasons why it stockpiles so much of it because you - you know, if you have 2,000 known flaws, you know, a percentage of those might be no longer exploitable only to you, you know, three months from now. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  While we're on the subject of all this, the military has been hacked. What's one of the worst hacks that the military has faced? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Probably the worst one that they faced was about five or six years ago. There was a really unsettling event that - this was in 2000 - actually, 2008, this was. There was a classified computer network used by U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And one day - it was a Friday, I believe - the people who monitor this network started noticing that there was a piece of software inside the network - a piece of malware - that wasn't supposed to be there. And it was actually sending out a beacon, which meant that it was this device inside the network, and it was trying to reach out and contact some other computer somewhere in the world on the Internet. </p><p>And this frightened people in the military quite a bit because the network that this malware was inside is not actually connected to Internet. It's such a secret and sensitive network that it is, as they say, air-gapped. It's separated physically from the rest of the Internet. So how in the world did that get in there? </p><p>The general theory now is that probably there was a soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan who inserted a thumb drive - one of those little USB sticks - that he may have picked up someplace, put it into a computer. And it had this malware on it, and it got loose inside of the network. This was an event that really frightened a lot of people in the military. The White House was made aware of it because it demonstrated that even if you have a network that is not physically connected to the Internet, there is still potentially a way for an adversary to infect that network. </p><p>It's not clear whether or not - if, in fact, it was spread by a USB - whether this was a foreign intelligence agency that, you know, planted it on this person or threw it in a parking lot, and somebody picked it up. But it demonstrated there was a way to get into these networks, even if you do everything physically possible to try to make them safe. That was probably one of the - in a military system, one of the worst instances. It did not end up compromising military operations, and no classified information was stolen. But it was a real wake-up call to people in the Pentagon. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  I think ever since the Edward Snowden <person><nameText>leaks, </nameText></person>a lot of Americans have been very suspicious of the NSA. But you write in the book, the NSA is not the enemy. Are there things you want to remind Americans of that the NSA is doing that is really very important to our security as individuals and as a nation? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Yes. I mean, the NSA is the biggest source of expertise in the government right now of people who know how to defend computer networks and are very good at that job. And that's a vitally important mission. We depend upon - we - citizens of the United States depend upon the Defense Department to protect us from foreign invaders. We would never imagine that if, you know, enemy planes were flying over the United States and dropping bombs, that the military would not respond to that. And within that context, the NSA does play a role for helping to defend computer networks in the United States. And we should be glad that we have that expertise there. </p><p>But what I argue is that the NSA has tried to take on, I think, too vast and too pervasive of a role and has fundamentally, in many ways, weakened all of our security, which I write a lot about in the book. In this desire to protect us, there's kind of a conflicting mission there. But we should understand that, I mean, ultimately, I think, you know, the agency is, I think, filled with good, very smart people who believe that they have a very important mission to help defend our networks. </p><p>What we need to do is sort of - is put the right constraints on the agency and the - and define more clearly what that agency's roles actually are because, heretofore, I think they've largely been made to - left to make those decisions on their own. And I think, arguably, the NSA has accrued too much power and too much authority over that vital mission. But, you know, we should remember that they're - effectively, I think that they're there to try and help. And we need good laws and good regulations and more transparency to understand how we can best use the expertise of the NSA and make sure that that authority and that power is not abused. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  If you're just joining us, my guest is Shane Harris. He's the author of the new book \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex,\" and he covers intelligence for The Daily Beast. Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TERRY GROSS:  This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Shane Harris, author of the new book \"@War: The Rise Of The Military-Internet Complex.\" And he covers cybersecurity and national intelligence for The Daily Beast. Let's talk about how cyberwar played a part in the war in Iraq - techniques that hadn't been used before. What were some of those techniques? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Well, in 2007, people will recall that the so-called surge began - the Iraq troop surge in which tens of thousands of more combat forces were put into Iraq. A little-noticed part of that military strategy was that the NSA developed a way to collect every electronic communication that was moving through Iraq - every cell phone call, every text message, every email that was sent. And they did this by physically tapping into, principally, the cellular phone networks in Iraq, which were really ballooning and blossoming at that time, and basically collect every piece of communication. And what they were trying to do here and what they did quite successfully was to hack into the cell phones and the computers that were used by insurgent fighters and members of al-Qaida in Iraq, which, of course, morphed later into the group ISIS that the U.S. is fighting in Iraq and Syria now. </p><p>The NSA's sort of elite hackers found ways to break into those phones, listen to the conversations. They sent fake text messages to some fighters, posing as their fellow fighters, telling them to go to a certain location to go plant a bomb. And when they got there, American troops were waiting for them. They found out ways to track people's cell phones even when they were turned off, using cell phones as sort of a tracking beacon so that it could figure out - if they knew a particular fighter or a bomb maker, they could follow him to where he was hiding out. They could round up his associates. The NSA actually infiltrated online websites - these forums that are used by jihadists - and planted malicious software in them so that when some of the people going to that site would go and would click on certain documents or read certain pages, their machines would become infected and that would allow the NSA to sort of hone in on them. And the agency gave all of this intelligence that it was generating to combat soldiers on the ground, particularly with the - what's called the Joint Special Operations Command, which are sort of the elite commandos in Iraq. And this sort of amazing, real-time cycle of intelligence began to take hold, whereby the NSA, which had basically hacked into the entire network infrastructure of Iraq, was able to gather information, send out fake information, send out malware and then physically locate where these fighters were and understand how their networks were arranged. So who was in charge? Who was the chief bomb maker? Who were people taking orders from? And feed that information to the troops on the ground, who then either went and captured those individuals or killed them. And a number of people I interviewed for the book - and even David Petraeus, who was the commander of ground forces in Iraq - has said this publicly. Credit that intelligence operation - that cyber operation - with being a deciding factor in turning around the tide of the war in favor of the American forces during the surge. It's credited with removing from the battlefield, either because they were captured or killed, at least 4,000 fighters and ultimately lead to us being able to dismantle al-Qaida in Iraq and at least for that period in time, you know, I think was arguably a U.S. military victory. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So what happens when an enemy could do the same thing against us? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  They would be able to find out where our forces are. And they would be able to find out how we're communicating. And that's something that the military is very concerned about. We are not the only country that has these kinds of capabilities. We have vast capabilities and they're quite extensive, but the governments of Russia, of China - Israel has really sophisticated cyber capabilities. What the military worries about now is that if we ever go into a conventional war with another country - let's pick China, which is an improbable event, but let's say we were at war with China. They would be trying to hack in our systems, too. They would be trying to manipulate our communications. They would be trying to disable our infrastructure. </p><p>And the reason that so many countries are developing these cyber capabilities, one big reason is that they know that they cannot challenge us in a conventional military setting. China is - does not have a Navy that can go head-to-head with ours. What they can do and is much easier to do is build a cyber capability that they could use if we were ever to get into a conflict. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Are you assuming that we're using cyber capabilities against ISIS now? Because ISIS has really been relying on social media and the Internet for its propaganda, including its beheading videos. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Right. They've made great use of social media for recruitment and to spread their message out. ISIS is actually a fascinating case - and I've actually been looking into this and interviewing people in government in the past few days about it. ISIS has actually proven to be quite resilient to our cyber efforts. And the reason for that is that they have avoided using cell phones, radios, satellite phones. They've been very careful about when they post messages to Twitter to strip out the information that shows the geographic location where a photo was taken or a tweet was sent. They have figured out, in many ways, how we spy and how we monitor - or at least have assumed generally that we do make a great effort to spy on our adversaries' communications. </p><p>And it's worth remembering, too, that ISIS is the successor group to al-Qaida in Iraq, which is the group that we so effectively attacked using these cyber capabilities. So ISIS has really gone to school on U.S. cyberwarfare and is proving - actually, a number of officials of told me in the past two days, very difficult to track and to target with airstrikes because they're staying off the grid. They know that once they communicate with these digital and electronic technologies, they put themselves at greater risk of being discovered. So they've really taken steps to try and limit the amount - the degree to which they are communicating with each other. And it's making it harder to target them. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  But it does disable their ability to communicate? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Exactly. And that's the flip side of it. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Looking on the bright side. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  On the bright side, exactly. (Laughter)  It's harder, you know, just to imagine trying to go through your day without sending email and without being able to use the phone. So this is actually a situation that Osama bin Laden, I think, faced when he was hiding out in Abbottabad, in a house that did not have any connection to the Internet. There was no Internet service there. He had to rely on human couriers. And it's still not clear exactly how ISIS is communicating. But what we're hearing from intelligence officials is that, you know, they are limiting the way that they communicate. That certainly, though, is going to have - put constraints on what they're able to do. So there is a positive benefit to that. </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  So, you know, we've been talking about hacking and stuff. We just - we recently learned that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, which includes the National Weather Service, was hacked by China. Why would that be a target? Why is that a target? </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  I think, in this case, because NOAA relies on information from sophisticated imaging satellites and weather satellites, that getting into NOAA would be a way of learning more about what our satellite technology is. That's one possibility. Also what we've seen is a pattern of hackers, perhaps, trying to get a foothold in one government agency and to try to use that as a launching point often into another agency that might be harder to get in through the front door of that organization. So it could be that the hackers wanted to get in to steal passwords and other credentials of NOAA employees, to then perhaps maybe imitate them and try and send communications to someone at another government agency, posing as this NOAA employee and trick them into downloading a piece of malware. </p><p>The thing that's fascinating and sort of confounding about Chinese cyber espionage is that it is so broad and so pervasive that I almost find myself thinking, what target haven't they tried to hit? And one of the reasons why I think the Chinese, in particular, are able to do this is they have just devoted so much manpower, so much human power. Thousands and thousands of hackers are believed to be just sort of spending their days in rotating shifts trying to hack into all manner of U.S. companies, government agencies. I do think it's sort of really a coup when someone gets into a government agency because they might have secret information and they're generally believed to be more well-protected, although, I think clearly, NOAA was not. But I think that China is looking for just as much intelligence as it can possibly gather about U.S. corporations and the U.S. government. And so I guess in a way, why not NOAA? </p><p>TERRY GROSS:  Well, Shane Harris, thank you so much for talking with us. </p><p>SHANE HARRIS:  Thanks, Terry.

There's plenty of straightforward insight, sprinkled with anecdotes culled from a decade in the trenches. The book also has some helpful tools for individual stock analysis.</p><p>Kwatinetz shows as well as he tells, revealing his own portfolio and how it has performed. Not surprisingly, it's heavy on PC technology companies, such as Compaq, Dell, Intel and Microsoft, as well as Cisco Systems Inc.  and Applied Materials Inc.</p><p>We caught up with Kwatinetz via e-mail for some talk about evaluating stocks.</p><p>Q: How do analysts evaluate companies differently than most individual investors do?</p><p>A: Individual investors often buy stocks without applying careful valuation.</p><p>For more mature companies, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios relative to growth rates are a great way to get a cut at valuation.  For less mature companies, an investor must determine the long-term business model.</p><p>Most companies provide guidance on this, but many have optimistic points of view . Therefore, look at such guidance (you can call the company to get it or look for analyst reports), but then compare it with other companies that are comparable and more mature.</p><p>Q: Some examples?</p><p>A: I never was a fan of WebVan because their long-term model (in my opinion) was likely to, at best, equal Safeway Inc., yet the company was trading at an enormous multiple of revenue.</p><p>Another example of individual investors ignoring valuation was when Palm Inc. first came public: About 95 percent of the stock was owned by 3Com Corp., yet Palm had more than three times the market cap of 3Com. Anyone paying attention to valuation could buy 3Com and own Palm at one-third the price, so the professionals all bailed on Palm.</p><p>Q: With the market's boom throughout the '90s, there was an explosion in demand for financial talent. How many of the analysts out there today are very good or at least very experienced at what they do?</p><p>A: Certainly the talent pool has been diluted, but there are still many very fine analysts.</p><p>Q: How did you become an analyst?</p><p>A: I ran a privately held software company that we sold to a public company, which asked me to sign a contract to stay on. When the contract was up, I decided to leave and consulted with friends on what to do next.</p><p>Given my background (MBA in accounting, Ph.D. in mathematical modeling, experience in software design, company management and prior experience running a modeling practice for a Big 5 consulting firm) the advice was to become an analyst.</p><p>Q: Where do most Wall Street analysts come from?</p><p>A: Analysts come from all over, but the two most common routes are MBAs and people with business experience in an industry who subsequently become an analyst for that industry. I'd guess that two-thirds are MBA types and only one-third come from industry.</p><p>Q: What's the key to determining how much value you should put on an analyst's research?</p><p>A: The answer is don't trust anyone but yourself. Treat an analyst's research as a source of information on the business and projections of the company, and then do your own work.</p><p>Q: How valuable are the various ratings and rankings of analysts by financial publications ? Do they mean anything?</p><p>A: The one I think is of the highest quality is Institutional Investor.  What that measures is which analysts are the most important sources of information and analysis for portfolio managers and buy-side analysts.</p><p>While this is not a perfect correlation with who is \"best,\" it gives great insight on who the professionals view as providing the most value.</p><p>Q: How does Regulation FD (the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule that companies provide information to all investors equally, not just analysts and institutional investors) change the landscape?</p><p>Will it level the playing field, or will companies say even less under the guise of fair disclosure?</p><p>A: I believe this has damaged the ability of companies to disclose incremental information. Instead, they do infrequent \"full disclosure\" and then go silent. As a result, there is more uncertainty in the market and more volatility in stocks.</p><p>You may contact John Pletz at 445-3601 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jpletz@statesman.com\">jpletz@statesman.com</email>.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>'Big Tech Score' author Mike Kwatinetz suggests individuals make sure their valuation of investment prospects is sound.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTIN-0100550597</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTIN2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4299-BNP0-0094-G506-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147871</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Austin American-Statesman (Texas)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 The Austin American-Statesman</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>February 4, 2001, Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>DELL INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0HEWLETT-PACKARD CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0PALM INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0JOHN WILEY &amp;

According to strategists at Societe Generale, the conditions are now ripe for value investing to make a comeback. They provided recommendations on what investors should take into consideration as they hunt for stocks that are trading at cheaper valuations relative to their earnings. </p><p>Long-suffering value investors could soon get the resurgence they have been waiting for. As the ongoingbull market[1]matured, high-growth companies like Amazon[2] and Facebook[3] stole the spotlight from value stocks \u2014 or those that were cheaper based on metrics like price-earnings ratio. Investors could simply have bought these growth stocks, closed their eyes, and reaped some of the most bountiful returns of this cycle. Big tech has faltered[4] of late, however, as investors worry that regulators are coming to prune their growth, which by itself is showing signs of peaking. This means value stocks may fall into favor again as investors seek alternatives, according to Andrew Lapthorne, the head of equity quantitative research at Societe Generale. \"Given the increasing bearish mood of global markets and the historically low current valuations of the value strategy after long periods of underperformance, conditions appear to be ripe for the long-awaited value resurgence,\" Lapthorne said in a note. Conventional wisdom suggests that value stocks work best during the early stages of an economic cycle. That's because investors scarred by the preceding crash become more discerning of valuations and suss out discounts. It further holds that value stocks suffer during downturns as consumer demand falters. Lapthorne concluded that there's more to value than these widely held assumptions. His study of their performance dating back to the 1920s indicates that value is often a resilient factor during episodes of market volatility. Furthermore, he observed that events associated with their outperformance often overlap with periods when risk assets and strategies underperform.  The chart below illustrates how value's performance stacked up next to the S...00 when the broader index fell by more than 10%.On the face of it, value stocks had a mixed track record. They sank with the broader market, went negative during 11 of the 24 episodes, and remained positive during 10 of them. But Lapthorne's closer examination produced two key findings. First, value rallies were stronger than the worst value downturns, with the dotcom bubble and 1980s inflation crisis among the blowout episodes. Secondly, the average value performance across these events was a -2.9% annualized drawdown, versus a 30% slump for the S...00. Relatedly, the average performance of value stocks was 2.4% per episode, compared to -25% for the S...00. Even nine-plus years into this historic bull market, it's still any investor's guess when exactly the next crash will happen, although many think it will be sooner rather than later. It's also uncertain whether (or by how much) value stocks will outperform the broader market in the next downturn. Lapthorne's message despite this uncertainty is that value has proven to be a hedge during regime shifts from low volatility to high volatility. \"The preponderance of our extensive research supports a robust value strategy to be more global than regional, neutral with respect to sector/industry exposures, but flexible with respect to country tilts, and prefers size weightings to capitalizations,\" Lapthorne said.NOW WATCH: The first woman in space almost didn't make it back to Earth and she had to keep it a secret for 30 years[5]See Also: Here's how Wall Street says investors

Revenue growth is cooling down at Amazon, <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Snapchat. Twitter is losing active users. Facebook is releasing its earnings report this week, and many\u00a0analysts expect\u00a0the trend of decelerating revenue growth from the second quarter to continue. The tech world, marked by its idealistic culture and high-growth mentality, may be in for its first reality check.</p><p>Although one quarter is far too short of a time frame to evaluate and diagnose financial troubles, the regulatory threat looms on the horizon as Silicon Valley companies face increased domestic scrutiny. While the United States has not even considered going as far as the European Union did with its General Data Protection Regulation,\u00a0the world's most stringent set of internet privacy protection laws, the state of California recently passed three bills that should set off alarm bells for the tech world's darlings. The bills seek to resolve the issues\u00a0of data privacy, net neutrality and lack of gender parity on corporate boards. California is limited in its ability to enforce these regulations due to a lack of buy-in at the federal level and the fact that many tech companies headquartered in California are legally chartered in Delaware and other states. But despite these constraints, California is setting a legal standard that reflects growing discontent from consumers and citizens. These new rules spook tech companies enough that\u00a0they will seek to preempt them\u00a0from taking effect by pushing for laxer regulation at the federal level.</p><p>Regulation may be an uphill battle for Washington to actually pass, but public scrutiny surrounding the culture in tech companies will continue to intensify in the meantime. Netflix is just one example - this week, the Wall Street Journal published an investigative piece exposing the company for its competitive culture where \"blunt firings\" have become more commonplace. <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>employees protested earlier this month\u00a0upon media reports of the company secretly working on a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship policies. And while <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>pulled out of competition for the Pentagon's $10 billion cloud computing contract due to concerns about the deal not reflecting its corporate values, Microsoft and Amazon have been criticized for reaffirming their commitment to such defense contracts. Axios's Kia Kokalitcheva explained that \"these big public tech companies are being pushed to acknowledge their responsibilities in the workplace and society, and can no longer hide behind the idealism of 'changing the world.'\"</p><p>The tension between technology giants and regulators is only getting started, and the public has realized that as both consumers and critics of the same platforms, it is getting caught in the crossfire. Fears of regulation posing a significant threat may seem far-fetched for now, but technology companies should be even more worried about the court of public opinion, as slowing user growth threatens the very core of their business models.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3879137</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKT-FYJ1-JBSN-3242-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tufts Daily: Tufts University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 29, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>PUBLIC TECHNOLOGY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I guess, Ted, for the benefit of those (inaudible), please give a brief overview of what's the Company is, what you've been to, the products that [you play in]?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TED DOSCH, EVP FINANCE &amp; CFO, ANIXTER INTERNATIONAL INC.: Sure, as of next year, we'll be a 60-year old company that started in the power cable, the wire cable business. The tagline they used back then you sometimes hear around the Anixter [by about a mile, still by the foot], which seems a little simplistic, but it is kind of the hallmark of our business model yet today, in that we aren't just a distributor, it is all about being a value-added distributor.</p><p>So today, we've gone from that wire and cable business in the power business, which now represents a little over $2 billion of our revenue. Our largest segment is all about data, in the network in the horizontal LAN -- I'm sorry, in the data center, horizontal LAN network and security that's about $4 billion business for us, that's the only one of our three businesses that's in 50-plus countries around the world. And then the newest part of our business came as a result of the acquisition of Power Solutions from HD Supply. It was the electrical distribution and utility business that they had and the utility portion of that business, which represents about $1.5 billion of revenue is what we call our UPS segment, Utility Power Solutions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That's great. And one of the questions I've been asking everybody, are we in a recession, right, it's a big question for industrial, maybe just your high level thoughts of where we are in this cycle, could we be tipping into a recession?</p><p>TED DOSCH: Yes, it's a great question and I kind of answer it in two parts. Are we in a recession? No. Are we in a recession for industrials? It kind of feels that way. So first, outside industrials, our NSS base, our Network &amp; Security Solutions business had continued to grow at an organic growth rate of about 4% for I think the last four quarters in a row. We've had positive organic growth there, 10 quarters in a row, that's a business that we feel very good about. Secular drivers as well as our position that will allow us to grow at a rate probably 150 to 200 basis points above market.</p><p>Specifically though in EES, Electrical &amp; Electronic Solutions, two major segments of that business are mining and oil and gas. Mining has been down a good 2.5 years, going on three years. Oil and gas, the way we look at it, will be two years in June. June of 2014 is when we really began to feel and see the significant impact and then, it's probably approaching one year since that oil and gas softness translated into broader weakness across the broader industrials.</p><p>So based on what we're seeing there, the pullback which to us the area that has the most significant impact is when industrial customers pull back on CapEx spend that's what has the most significant impact on the products that we sell. That's been a factor out there for about a year. Having said that, in Q1 we don't feel that what we've seen changing the market is enough to cause a turn or to necessarily say we hit the bottom, but at least based on the indicators we're seeing including pipeline, number of RFPs, new quotes et cetera that are out there, it feels like the word we used a lot on our call was stabilizing, I'd like to give it another quarter or two (multiple speakers) to really turn the corner but reason for optimism is that we did see much more activity from the pipeline standpoint.</p><p>Our backlog at the end of Q1 was up double-digit percentage wise, low-teens from where it was at the end of December and up a similar number from where it was a year ago March. So two indicators that I think there is some light at the end of the tunnel, I'm not sure if that's one quarter or two quarters or when.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: We see Anixter has a unique portfolio right now. You mentioned the term secular drivers. Can you kind of help us understand the secular drivers very unique in the space right now?</p><p>TED DOSCH: Again, I really need to take it segment by segment, because it does vary. So in our largest segment, NSS, $4 billion, about 60% of that is really data related, data center spend, horizontal LAN spend, wireless spend et cetera. So the key drivers of that -- the single biggest one is data, whether it's companies and their needs and their data center, whether it's all of us with our cell phones and iPads, et cetera that we want more data, more video, more graphics, by the way we want it faster than we've ever wanted before. So that drives the need for data spend growth in both the data center as well as bandwidth. So it's both storage and transmission.</p><p>So with that, we continue to see growth, not as high as it was a few years back, but again probably at 3% type growth in just basic data center spend and that's both in what I would call enterprise spend, companies like Anixter where we have our own data center. It's in multi-tenant data centers, the companies like Equinix and Digital Realty that's still a relatively small part of the industry, it's probably only about 9% or 10% of the industry today; projected to grow to 15% in the next three years or so. So percentage wise, it's growing rapidly. Both of the big guys have done significant acquisitions and so they're getting a bigger percent of footprint. And then what we or the industry sometimes refers to as the hyper data centers, that's the big tech guys, the Google, the Amazon, eBay, Microsoft, et cetera, the growth in cloud, software-as-a-service in general, all of that, their spend is continuing at a very, very large clip, and it's not just US spend and that's where we think we have a competitive advantage because we work with these guys with the same products, the same level of service, the same system and so forth wherever they're building. If they're building like out in California with Apple's new headquarters and we're doing their data center and their headquarter wiring or whether it's three of them that are building data centers in the Nordics right now, or whether it's in Asia or elsewhere.</p><p>Let me just comment on wireless. Even though wireless is a very small part of our business today, it's the fastest growing of any product segments within our entire portfolio. It grew at a cliff of almost 50% last year. We'd expect it to grow at a similar cliff this year and again, back to all the handheld wireless devices we have, it's buildings like this and others where the signal is weak in the building, and more and more of these micro-cells, the DAS, distributed antenna systems are being installed to connect to the exterior macro-cell.</p><p>Jumping to EES for a moment, despite the softness in the power industrial switches, I would say a more macro damper, if you will, to overall demand, there are areas of that business both that are showing signs of improvement, but also I would [say sort of a secular] driver and more of our product positioning and our services positioning, one of which is what we refer to as ITC, Industrial Communication and Control, because it's a subset of industrial automation and the trend -- and we all know there has been automation in factories for decades, but what's changed in, say, these last three to five years, which is driving the real opportunity for us is as these companies have gone from -- or the technology has gone from proprietary technology to more open architecture, what's happening is all this automation that was on the assembly line or a paint booth or in a stamping press department instead of all that data being collected right there at the work site, now it's being connected to their ERP systems. This data is feeding their ERP systems. One of the quotes I like reading about this phenomena is for the first time CIOs care what happens on the plant floor because out and all that data is feeding their systems.</p><p>So we have a business that's grown to over $0.25 billion up until this last year with the softness in industrials was growing at a cliff of about 20% CAGR for the last few years and that's all organic. We haven't done any acquisitions in the space. We certainly -- it's a possibility but it's an area that I think despite the secular headwinds, we're positioned very well for that.</p><p>And then the other one that I'll comment on that is not driven by kind of the macro demand that's more driven by our recent acquisition of Power Solutions, one-third of that business was what they refer to as Construction and Industrial C&amp;I, the low-voltage business. This is a very strategic opportunity we felt to blend that business into our legacy Wire &amp; Cable. Our Wire &amp; Cable business, even though it was a couple of billion dollar business, 80% of our revenue was still cable. The business we acquired on the low-voltage side, only 20% of that business was wire and cable. So we picked up lighting and switchgear and transformers and other products, all of which connect to our cable by the way, but it gives us an opportunity to have a broader portfolio, a greater share of wallet with many of these customers.</p><p>And then lastly in the utility side, it's a business that the experts would say as an electric institute and other folks say, hey, this business is going to grow, CapEx spend is going to grow 4% to 5% CAGR for the next five years. Well, it hasn't been doing that recently and they point to a whole lot of reasons why but reason to believe that that trend will change I think are what critically point to things like the aging grid, the infrastructure and some would say, well, they've been talking about that for years and CapEx didn't grow. Well, what's changed now is the propensity of FERC and the local state energy regulatory authorities to allow them to recover the CapEx through rate increase, which historically grid spend was considered normal maintenance and you couldn't get incremental rate for it. So the fact that they're starting to grant that is a plus.</p><p>Secondly, smart grid, a major part of that UPS segment of ours is automation of smart meters and so forth.</p><p>And then thirdly, and this one we think we're uniquely positioned in, there is a tremendous opportunity with security products into utility space. Again, regulatory requirements at all these utilities have to have a plan by the third quarter of next year to harden their substations. In recent years, somebody trying to shoot out a transformer in California and try to bust down the gate and destroy the substation or whatever, it isn't just a function of keeping the grid up and keeping the lights on, but the requirements we think fit right in our wheelhouse as these utilities don't typically have the security expertise and we're meeting with all of the major utilities to help them identify what that game plan or what that kind of turnkey proposal is to provide a security solution for substations.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: These are all great and I think one of the questions is it's hard to find secular growth drivers [to ebb rates] that are offsetting these headwinds. What about competitive dynamics? Do you see people trying to enter this market because of those trends and what can Anixter do to protect sort of their share of mind?</p><p>TED DOSCH: It's a great question. No matter how you look at it, all our three segments and in all of our geographies, so very fragmented business. So I think there certainly is room for consolidation and the challenge with that, I think is less on kind of the distribution side and more on the supply side.</p><p>There's a lot of, well, I would say most of these key distributors or I'm sorry, key suppliers out there are already heavily distributed. So they aren't necessarily looking to pick up another new distributor that type of thing. But when we think about distribution in general, which most people would think of as having low barriers to entry, again, that's why our focus so extensively is not on price, but it's on the value-add services. The supply chain services, the cable management, the technical expertise that we bring to bear is typically why we aren't the low price guy when it comes to a pure product play and focus on those value-add services.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And when I think of wired cable, copper comes to mind. Can you walk through how you manage sort of that copper, the volatility, once we see it, obviously commodities are --</p><p>TED DOSCH: Copper is certainly a factor and the way it's shaping up right now, it's actually going to be a bigger headwind in Q2 than Q1, because last year, Q1 to Q2 copper went up. This year Q1 to Q2, copper went down so the gap year-over-year is just a little greater this year than last.</p><p>I think our guys do a really good job of helping to minimize or mitigate the risk associated with fluctuations in copper. First off, lower copper price is not a hit to our gross margin percentage, but it is dollars, because we have a model like many distributors, our guys are going price it at X percent above the cost of the input. So number one, inflation is our friend, but with a lower copper, it tends to be a pass-through to the customer. But when copper is lower, our revenue is lower and it's one of those days - it's like your pricing, revenue is lower, but expense didn't drop so it puts operating margin pressure.</p><p>The way -- we work on an average cost basis. Our sales folks know every day what the average cost of any SKU is in our system. So they have a real-time information to help ensure that they're driving towards their margin goals and if copper is dropping like it is today, we don't want -- while we know we've got higher cost product in the warehouse that hasn't sold through yet, we don't want our salespeople incentivized to go to the market so to speak, to go to the lower price and just us take a hit in pricing.</p><p>So I think we have incentive programs with our sales folks to help ensure that they're not just rewarded based on revenue but they are rewarded based on gross margin percentage.</p><p>The other key thing I think as a way to help mitigate this risk when it comes to larger projects that tends to be where the biggest risk is, customers coming in and placing a six, seven figure type order for products and they want delivery in 60 days or 90 days or six months. We have a practice at Anixter, we negotiate with our suppliers that when a customer is placing a dated order, again, we don't speculate. So if the customer says I think copper is going up, I want to lock in today's price, we place a back-to-back order with the supplier and lock in today's price as well, so we have no risk associated with the price of that product even if it's going to be delivered in three months, six months or 12 months. Those other times like in a more recent environment where the customer might say I think copper is going down further, and they place the order today and say I want to lock in whatever the price will be on date of delivery and in that case, we do a back-to-back and we lock it in even though we don't know what the price is, that's the risk our supplier takes.</p><p>So we're not speculating, we're not trying to make money on the copper market per se, it is about mitigating risk and about letting our guys do what they do best, which is sell the product, sell the value-add, take out the risk associated with those big projects.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And in line with (inaudible) obviously, the big application with the power solution side, you touched but there is still (inaudible) within couple of areas where you'd like to grow. How do you view the M&amp;A environment? Are you still absorbing Power Solutions and then taking a little breather from now, how should we think about that within the --</p><p>TED DOSCH: Yes, it's a great question. The easy answer in the short-term is I'll say we're taking a breather but I don't anticipate us doing any major acquisitions in the next 12 months to 18 months for a couple of reasons. One, we levered up higher than where we typically would like to be as a result of this acquisition. And two, key metrics that we're shooting for in our strategic goals, we want to have leverage in the 2.5 to 3 range. We went up to 3.8 as a result of this acquisition, which is an unreasonable or overly burdensome. We got this already down to 3.7 at the end of Q4, we would expect that get down to 3 by the second half of next year.</p><p>The other metric is we look at debt-to-total cap. We're very comfortable on a 45% to 50% range. We went up as high as 58% at the end of Q4. We got it down to 56% at the end of Q1. Again, we think that'll be down below 50% in the back half of next year. So from a cash flow, cash allocation standpoint for this next 12, 15 months, it's about paying down the debt to get us down into those target levels but in the meantime, we need to be focused on integration.</p><p>So back to my point, we've not exactly taken a breather, but there's still a lot of heavy lifting to do with the integration.</p><p>We're extremely pleased with where we are 18 months into the Tri-Ed acquisition and six months into the Power Solutions acquisition, but there's still a lot more to do in delivering on the $40 million of synergies that we've targeted for these acquisitions. Having said that, if we're sitting here late next year, have our debt where we like it and we don't see the right opportunity in the M&amp;A pipeline, we will be considering what we've done in the past with returning value to shareholders, which has historically been through either share repurchase or special dividends.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So I'm thinking a year -- 12 months to 18 months from now, what would an acquisition look like, would it be a product sort of holding you're trying to sell, an end market, a region, how should we think of the strategic view on acquisition M&amp;A?</p><p>TED DOSCH: It could be one or more of them and so let me frame it this way. First off, we don't feel that, we just literally are finishing our strategic plan that we'll present to our Board of Directors in two weeks. We annually do that in the month of May. We do not feel we have gaps that are as extensive as a fourth leg to the stool, so to speak. We think there is plenty of work to do around these three segments that we have. What I would see though, which would be less than a fourth leg of the stool, is some -- maybe more niche opportunities. I mentioned wireless. Wireless is still a small component of our business. Prior to this Tri-Ed acquisition, we grew our security business to over $1 billion almost exclusively organically. We may not wait that long to do an acquisition in the wireless space, as an example.</p><p>Utilities, right now the utility business is only US and Canada. We think there's tremendous opportunity to take those products globally, sourced out into Mexico and beyond and then into Europe. We're not sure yet dynamics around organic versus inorganic but that could be a possibility as well. And in security, securities just continue become core to our business and we may have the opportunity, I'd say outside North America, I don't really think there is any inside North America to help us say accelerate the growth rates, to get the critical mass faster elsewhere around the world in the security space.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That's great. And you touched on integration, HD Supply, very good operators are going to be on other Power Solutions business, I guess can you walk us through that process of the integration, can you even improve those margins, offset volumes and is there anything that they're bringing to the table to you that maybe (inaudible)?</p><p>TED DOSCH: First off, we've been studying them for quite some time. We'd actually been in dialog with HD Supply even before the IPO, partly because when we took our strategic plan to our Board in 2012, we said we have a gap in Wire &amp; Cable, it's called low-voltage products and we really want to expand into utility. It took us three years to fully execute that and in the meantime, we looked at a lot of other companies and quite frankly, even though, as I mentioned before, it's a pretty much fragmented marketplace out there, we didn't find one that we felt we could get at least -- we want to get at least two of our three key objectives within that space and this part of the business gave us two of the three, the low-voltage products and the utility part, the third one we didn't get is ITC. I mentioned we grew that business to $0.25 billion and we were thinking if we could get an acquisition to help us significantly grow that business that would be kind of the icing on the cake.</p><p>But as we looked at other companies, one, some weren't interested in being bought, some even though they were substantial in a region, they didn't have a national footprint and we felt we'd end up having to do two or three acquisitions and each acquisition in of itself has a certain amount of risk associated with the integration. So we've got going with the larger footprint like Power Solutions hope to reduce some of that risk.</p><p>So again, so it was probably a three-year dialog with them. Ultimately, they determined the time was right for them and it was a pretty competitive process with both strategics and sponsors involved along the way. I would say that, we think, clearly think we have been able to and are able to bring to the table relative to the acquired part of the business, a lot of that has to do with some of the value-add services and technical expertise, et cetera. And it's just from business processes. That was a business that was -- it really wasn't even run as one company. This isn't meant to be a critique of HD Supply, but HD Supply was a bunch of acquisitions sewn up together. It was still being operated as two companies, a low-voltage company with one ERP system and one set of warehouses and one sales force and a utility high-voltage as another. So there is a lot of back office leverage and cost take out that we can do as we get that converted to our systems, but the bigger part is they were very, very decentralized when it came to procurement and inventory management and so forth. So we think there's some opportunities when it comes there.</p><p>On the flip side, they do a really, really good job in managing and executing day-to-day serving utilities. Utilities for the most part are high demand, hard-to-keep happy type customer for a whole lot of reasons and they have kept some of these customers for 5, 10, 15, 20 years if you go back to some of the predecessor organizations like Hughes Supply bit of had some of these customer relationships for 20 years or 25 years. The only way they've done that, I'm sure you've got to meet the financial requirements, but they mainly kept that business because of their day-to-day execution and their ability to deliver on service. So they do some things really well that I think we can apply in some of our more complex service offerings.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And then touching on service offerings, it's a little bit unique versus just buying and selling being the middleman. Maybe elaborating on some of the unique things that Anixter does in terms of value offering?</p><p>TED DOSCH: Sure and maybe I'll hit on one real quick in each of the three segments. But in NSS, tech security for example, in many of our security products that we sell into, it's a complete turnkey operation. So take, this will be a real-life example, from a few years back, New York City, we're doing major project partnering with IBM and the Homeland Security Group of New York City in putting video cameras around the city. It was thousands of cameras in thousands of locations where we didn't just ship a whole bunch of cameras and a whole bunch of cable and a whole bunch of connectors in our warehouse to make it a complete turnkey.</p><p>First off, we helped them configure just exactly what they need and it wasn't the same camera everywhere. It depends on what the light is here, what -- facing the sun or not, what the requirements are in this location, et cetera. But we basically in our warehouse took thousands of cameras, we opened them up, did a DOA check on, loaded the software from IBM, serial number tagged them, installed them or sub-assemble, if you will, into an enclosure to protect from the weather, put the cable on at the connectors, all that goes into a box labeled 101 for example, so that the installer in the field has a kit to install on pole 101 or whatever.</p><p>So significantly reduced the total cost of acquisition, increased the cost of raw parts, but significantly reduced the total costs including labor and de-risked it, so now you don't have lose parts, mismatched assemblies, delays in installation, et cetera.</p><p>In the case of EES, we have extensive cable management practices. For example, there is a new manufacturing plant being built. We work with the contractors. We do take offs on all the engineering drawings. So we're not just shipping big reels of cable there to be installed, to be cut and installed et cetera. We'll know for example that (technical difficulty) 10,000 feet of this size of cable, it's 2,500 foot lengths on this day and it's five 100 foot lengths on this day et cetera. We cut the lengths, deliver on site, so it is a just-in-time delivery type operation that again reduces their overall cost, because without that a general contractor trying to manage that will always over order and a typical project would had 10% to 15% material wastage.</p><p>So we not only get that cost out of it but we ensured that the right product is available for installation on the right day, et cetera.</p><p>And then lastly in UPS, they do a great job as I mentioned with a lot of that day-to-day execution. I'll give you just two quick examples there. One is storm response. So our warehouses in that part of the business, we have people on 24/7 available. So when the storm hit, the trees knock the power lines down, neighborhoods are out of electricity, our guys are headed into the warehouse. So we have SLAs with these utilities that we have to have certain products available within so many hours for a storm response and we get great accolades for the ability to meet those requirements. Again, it's always unpredictable. You don't know where it's going to hit or what the magnitude of it.</p><p>The other thing I would say and this is a great opportunity for outsourcing of work from utilities to us. But when there's a major project like in the Northeast, we're just working on completing a three-year project. It was a 500-mile build of transmission cable and so Utility because over the years, they hadn't done many of these projects, they no longer have the capabilities in-house so they completely outsourced the project to us. So what do we do for them, when I say the project, I'm sorry, we [weren't] installing and so forth, but outsourced the inventory management of it, the acquisition of the product and the inventory management.</p><p>So we're out there. If you're building 500 miles of transmission cable, you're going out somewhere in the middle and nowhere and we're leasing some land, we're building a laydown yard, we're having two feet of gravel brought in so that product and big equipment can be stored, et cetera. All the product comes in direct shipped from the manufacturer and we are actually managing that yard to service say 50 miles of construction. Three months later when they finished that, we actually moved 100 miles down the road and set up a new laydown yard and then service that project for the next 50 miles or whatever. So it's gone well. It certainly involves obviously, procurement of material and inventory management, but the service that we're providing typically at much, much higher margin than just a markup on material is the ability to manage that entire activity, which includes acquiring the land, building out the laydown yard, everything associated with making that a turnkey service for them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I know we're running out of time. Does anybody have a specific question or I'll keep going. You talked about margins of value-added service. Gross profit and gross profit margins have been a challenge for distributors as a whole. (inaudible) to Anixter, how are you protecting those margins, how do you expect to grow the gross profit margin going forward?</p><p>TED DOSCH: Yes, it's a great question. One thing not to start with a pat on our own back, but we have been able to maintain our gross margin percentage throughout kind of the cycle. Now, if you look at the absolute numbers as reported, our gross margin down versus a year ago, which is completely a function of selling a high margin business and acquiring two businesses with lower gross margins. But if you take kind of the reformed -- repositioning of the business aside, our gross margins have been pretty flat over the last five or six years, which I attribute to a good job of managing copper and its volatility, managing deflationary pricing pressure. Some of our products that have become more commoditized have much greater pricing pressure on the data side, for example, pretty standard Cat5 cable, four pair of copper data cabling price is down 19% in the last four years.</p><p>So we've offset that and then we've also offset the impact of product mix. And what I mean by that is in security, which is growing faster than the data center side of NSS, by its nature tends to have lower margins and I say, well, why is it? The big ticket items in security are electronics: video cameras, DVRs, et cetera. Well, you can go to Best Buy and buy a video camera coming from some of those same manufacturers and you're going to pay a whole heck a lot less than you would have to three years ago. The same thing applies to security cameras. So the ticket price of those are coming down. We're still getting the same margin percentage, but the higher the gross revenue, the average sales price continues to drop.</p><p>So my point is as security grows faster than other areas that puts downward pressure on the consolidated margins.</p><p>What we've been able to do I think with more value-add services, with some -- I'd say some new software we've installed to help our salespeople to make smarter pricing decisions day in and day out and doing, I would say, just a better job of getting value for the services that we're providing that hasn't significantly grown our gross margin, but it's helped compensate or offset the effects of copper on all these other things.</p><p>Having said that, I wouldn't project that a year from now or five years from now, our gross margin is going to be significantly more than it is today. I think the dynamics, all those things I just mentioned and so forth, will continue to put some downward pressure on gross margin percentage. We'll manage to offset that, maybe take it up 10 basis points here or there.</p><p>The real opportunity we have, I think from a bottom line margin standpoint, and I would suggest that where we are now at somewhat of a low point, partly because of the repositioning of the business. The business we bought from Power Solutions had a much, much lower operating profit margin than what we had and we've got our EES business with very depressed margins because of mining, oil and gas and the broader industrials that's off about a couple of hundred basis points from where it should be say in mid-cycle, if you will.</p><p>So I think as we're very well positioned as we get, I must say, even if it's not a tailwind, it's less of a headwind in that sector and get a little bit of increase in demand, we'll leverage the heck out of a little bit of revenue growth. We have a cost base that we continue to take various steps to right size. We've taken some costs out in Canada, Brazil, Continental Europe, some of the areas that have continued to be slow growth or have had major challenges like Brazil certainly has and Western Canada certainly has.</p><p>So, I feel good about our cost structure that we'll be able to grow the revenue base quite significantly without any significant change in the cost structures.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That's great. Well, I think we're pretty much running out of time.

As iPhone In Canada first reported, Apple has filed a notice of opposition against a meal planning app called Prepear for using a pear logo which is pear-shaped and pear-green. In a Change.org petition , Prepear lamented that, \u201cApple has opposed dozens of other trademark applications filed by small businesses with fruit related logos,\u201d which have since been altered or replaced, because, \u201cmost small businesses cannot afford the tens of thousands of dollars it would cost to fight Apple.\u201d                         Apple thought of fruit in 1976, and you can\u2019t have it back.    The Apple lawyers are fearsome, we know, and will battle government regulators no matter how long and arduous the path to victory . No fruit has escaped them : just over the past few months, they pursued apple-shaped diamond pendants , apple-flavored   vape juice , and the Appleton, Wisconsin school district . They\u2019ve tried to stop a digital music company attempting to brand itself as \u201cFranki Pineapple\u201d (the logo for which resembles a grenade ), arguing that , \u201cwhile the word \u2018apple\u2019 and \u2018pineapple\u2019 do not have the same meaning, they are both the names of fruits, and thus convey a similar commercial impression.\u201d    In its notice of opposition against Prepear, Apple particularly takes issue with Prepear\u2019s fruit-branded focus on health \u2014 exactly like Apple. \u201cOne of the categories highlighted on Apple\u2019s Health app is Nutrition,\u201d they offer, as one example, noting also that the Apple Watch monitors heart rates, and Apple provides software for healthcare providers. On top of consumers\u2019 immediate association between Apple and health, Prepear\u2019s pear, they argue, is likely to recall the Apple logo because just look at it.    \u201cApplicant\u2019s Mark consists of a minimalistic fruit design with a right-angled leaf, which readily calls to mind Apple\u2019s famous Apple Logo and creates a similar commercial impression, as shown in the following side-by-side comparison:\u201d       In short, the above pear is certain to baffle consumers. \u201cThe Apple Marks are so famous and instantly recognisable that the similarities in Applicant\u2019s Mark will overshadow any differences and cause the ordinary consumer to believe that Applicant is related to, affiliated with or endorsed by Apple.\u201d What if some disappointed consumer comes to Prepear to buy an overpriced laptop and leaves empty-handed? Think of the reputational damages!    It\u2019s a leap for me, but after inspecting Apple\u2019s long history of filings, one can imagine how Apple might be blinded by its own fruit. Last year, they reportedly filed an objection against Norway\u2019s Progress Party for using an apple, against Banana Computer and Banana Mobile , and Pear Technologies , which also branded itself with a pear.    In their Change.org petition , Prepear, which claims to have only five staffers, says that the thousands of dollars wasted on litigation has already forced one layoff \u2014 but they\u2019re not taking this lying down. \u201cWe feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple\u2019s aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo,\u201d they write. \u201cWe are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.\u201d The Change.org petition, which currently has over 26,000 signatures, asks that Apple drop its \u201cfrivolous litigation\u201d and \u201cstop big tech companies from abusing their position of power by going after small businesses like ours who are already struggling due to the affects [sic] of Covid-19.\u201d    Can you tell an apple from a pear?
