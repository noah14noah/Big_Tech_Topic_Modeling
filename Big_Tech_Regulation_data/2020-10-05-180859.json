Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> VONNIE QUINN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Now, as we look ahead to 2019, Bloomberg  Senior Deals Reporter Ed Hammond joined with Mark Shafir, co-head of global  merger and acquisition at Citigroup.  Mark, we have to start with this  morning's news, the arrest of the Huawei executive and not just the  executive but the daughter of the CEO, did it reverberate in the M&amp;A  community, what might have mean?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MARK SHAFIR, CO-HEAD OF GLOBAL M&amp;A AT CITIGROUP:  Well, look, I mean,  obviously you've seen the impact on the public market.  Our market tends to  be more trend-oriented, longer-term so the extent, this is indicative of  worsening relations, it is not helpful.  But I'd say, you know, and to get  in the short intermediate run like the 90 day hiatus we have got here  nationally on tariffs, I think again, it is not as relevant because of the  timeframes we deal in.</p><p> ED HAMMOND, BLOOMBERG NEWS' NEW SENIOR DEALS REPORTER:  Mark, it seems to  be always your misfortune to come on and talk a moment when we have some  negative news flow around the M&amp;A market.  Talk to us about the optimism,  because there have been a lot of deals in 2018, and the expectation is we  have good flow in '19.  So when you are talking companies particular here  in the U.S., what are the most optimistic about?</p><p> SHAFIR:  You know look, I think that when look at it, we generally had a  pretty good economy.  And so that's -- that particularly in the U.S., those  house, you know, and the neighborhood so to speak.  So I think that's  generally been very positive I think.  And as a result, you know, we've  seen -- it will be sort of a pretty good year even though we have seen  slowing really since the Mark Schaefer (ph) timeframe in terms of monthly  volumes.  I mean, I think the volumes will be up 20 to 25% on a based case  basis, again, we think it will slow next year short of real problems either  yield curve inverts, we have problems there economically, or alternatively,  you know, of trade relations really worsen.  And I think it, you know, sort  of all best will be off.  But, I think a lot of the optimism has been a  pretty decent economy, and that tends to impact the CEO and board  confidence.</p><p> HAMMOND:  But the kind of deals we're seeing deals suggest that we maybe  like cycle.  We're seeing, you know, things IBM, Red Hat, interesting field  but sort of a classic old company and apparently high-growth.  New company  which something we typically see anyway.  And then you have this other  trend which is a huge run-up in spins and the best which is again something  we typically see late in the M&amp;A.  So do you keep that for us?  Where do  you guys feel we are?</p><p> SHAFIR:  Yes, look, we obviously had a fairly long and decent market here,  right?  And I do not think anybody can really argue that.  I've seen the  difference here with this, you know, the old to know is tech disruption,  you know, is ubiquitous.  And so, I don't know that, you know, the old soft  of, you know, some of the old correlations necessarily hold because we  spend a lot of time with our tech bankers, you know, talking to in all  industries about the impact whether it's industries that are -- you know  that have been impacted like travel and leisure, or those, you know,  they're more on the come down the road like attractive industries and  mining.  So, I would discount that a little bit.  I don't think you are  wrong on the divestiture piece.  We correlate pretty well towards, you  know, periods where M&amp;A does get a little bit slower, so and 2018 has been  a very big year.</p><p> HAMMOND:  It's so close for record, right, on that front.</p><p> SHAFIR:  It's pretty close.</p><p> HAMMOND:  And another thing is that seems to be happening is, you know, the  kind of deals that were being done earlier on in the cycle where very  logical ones once ultimate have been told about for a long, long-time.   Now, we are seeing sort of slightly more out-of-the-box ideas come to the  fore.  Is that because people think the window is shutting or is that just  the case that look, investors have been rewarding big tech M&amp;A and so CEO  too missed out in front of cycle of pushing forward to do the deals?</p><p> SHAFIR:  Yes, you're certainly lucky.  You can sort of argue it is a little  bit of both.  I do not view a lot of the stuff that we are seeing, you  know, necessarily as illogical or sort of the double take when you walk by  your Bloomberg terminal, will plug for you guys.  I don't see that.  I  think with activism and with, you know, shareholders really all over  companies today, you know, you get -- John Chambers once told me many years  ago, you get one mistake, I get two.  And I think that really, really bears  on material M&amp;A for CEOs.</p><p> GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Mark, good morning.  Guy in London.   Private equities got a lot of dry powder sitting on the sidelines right  now.  What will JPs (ph) 00:00:30 make of the recent market sell-off in  equities?  Will they see it as an opportunity or something else?</p><p> SHAFIR:  No, look, I think clearly, the interesting thing is, we have seen  the sell-off.  But if you look at multiples, you know, we are still sitting  at sort of the second-highest range.  It's just under 14 times EBITDA and,  you know, for transactions in excess of 200 million, where there is public  reporting.  So it is still an expensive market.</p><p> I do think that if we see a significant correction on the public equity  markets, which I said many time here, we price off, and I think you could  definitely see that, that but it is a lag effect.  You know, sellers are  not going to immediately adjust buyers, want it downside, it goes the  opposite on the upside.  So I think with some lag effect, if this  correction continues, and I think you will see some impact to our pricing,  but that is a six-month or nine-month or a year type phenomenon, it's not  going to occur instantly by any stretch.</p><p> But I do think the dry powder, Guy, the point you make is a very real one.   You know, there's something like a trillion dollars or more, depending upon  who you talk to.  A lot of that has been sponsored, activity has been sort  of selling to each other, and some monetization.  And about 25% or 30% of  it has been, you know, sort of typical, sort of (inaudible) type, the  private stuff.  We would see some of that in an environment where prices  correct somewhat and the strategic pullback a little bit.</p><p> QUINN:  As you sit here, U.S. antitrust enforcers are trying to undo the  AT&amp;T-Time Warner Merger approval in court.  Is this era for regulatory, you  know, sensibilities in the U.S.?</p><p> SHAFIR:  Look, I think it is a fair question.  We saw what CFIUS did early,  you know what CFIUS has done about Broadcom, and Qualcomm, and some other  things.  I do think, we're seeing, you know, we saw an enhancement to the  CFIUS rules earlier in the year, looking at, you know, sort of partial  investments.  We think in the U.K. and Germany, possibly China, so look, I  think we are in a regulatory environment that is more challenging, relative  to what it has been.  How far that goes I think is partially tied up with  trade relations.  And how that will sort itself out.</p><p> HAMMOND:  Is that a surprise, Mark?  Because, this great expectation when  Trump came in that he would be pro-business, it will be a huge boon to the  kind of M&amp;A that have not traditionally been possible particularly under  the previous administration.  Has it been a disappointment for dealmakers?</p><p> SHAFIR:  You know, I do not know that I would say that.  I mean, I think  the sort of a confidence interval around the predictive capability on what  will and will not get through has widened.  I don't know that I say it's  necessarily disappointment.  And I don't know that necessarily blame it on  the administration.  I mean, the fact is, you look at geopolitical  relations around the globe and things have changed.  We are in a more  mercantile environment.</p><p> HAMMOND:  Let's look forward to 2019.  What are the deals do you expect to  see and what sectors are going to really blossom?</p><p> SHAFIR:  You know, look, I think that clearly, you know, we are seeing tech  is going to continue to be an extremely big part of anything we say and do.   And I think partially that will even go through a downturn because of the  disruptive nature of what is going on, Cloud, the data analytic sort of  mobility, all the stuff we -- again, we've talked about ad nauseam.  I do  not think that's going away.</p><p> I do think convergence of media, direct consumer -- all these things really  drive it.  You know, I think we will just have to see how close to the line  these deals are, and what position the various, you know, regulatory bodies  around the globe take.  I do not have a crystal ball.  I wish I did.</p><p> QUINN:  You might have a crystal ball on this one thought because, I think  both the end and want to know about conglomerates and whether there is  going to be more carve outs or scaling up next year?</p><p> SHAFIR:  You know, look, as I said earlier, I mean, the vestiges, breakups  been, you know, in a slower M&amp;A does correlate to sort of you can argue, I  don't want to use the term, cyclical end here because that -- I am not  trying to be overly pessimistic.</p><p> Look, I think there is some correlation.  We would expect that to continue.   We saw the United Technologies announcement.  We've seen some fairly big,  you know the steel chem., specially Chem Steel, Carlisle (ph), Johnson  Controls.  So I do think, you know, this is a phenomenon that will  continue, and it's driven by tech disruption and activism.  And the fact  that I think you know, managements and boards are really holding management  accountable to have a lean and very rational, you know, suite of businesses  as a portfolio.  So it is not going away.</p><p> QUINN:  Our thanks to you, Mark Shafir.</p><p> SHAFIR:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> QUINN:  A very busy co-head of global M&amp;A, he's busy and of course, always  thanks to Bloomberg Ed Hammond, our deals reporter.</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

But, I think a lot of the optimism has been a  pretty decent economy, and that tends to impact the CEO and board  confidence.</p><p>HAMMOND:  But the kind of deals we're seeing deals suggest that we maybe  like cycle.  We're seeing, you know, things IBM, Red Hat, interesting field  but sort of a classic old company and apparently high-growth.  New company  which something we typically see anyway.  And then you have this other  trend which is a huge run-up in spins and the best which is again something  we typically see late in the M&amp;A.  So do you keep that for us?  Where do  you guys feel we are?</p><p>SHAFIR:  Yes, look, we obviously had a fairly long and decent market here,  right?  And I do not think anybody can really argue that.  I've seen the  difference here with this, you know, the old to know is tech disruption,  you know, is ubiquitous.  And so, I don't know that, you know, the old soft  of, you know, some of the old correlations necessarily hold because we  spend a lot of time with our tech bankers, you know, talking to in all  industries about the impact whether it's industries that are -- you know  that have been impacted like travel and leisure, or those, you know,  they're more on the come down the road like attractive industries and  mining.  So, I would discount that a little bit.  I don't think you are  wrong on the divestiture piece.  We correlate pretty well towards, you  know, periods where M&amp;A does get a little bit slower, so and 2018 has been  a very big year.</p><p>HAMMOND:  It's so close for record, right, on that front.</p><p>SHAFIR:  It's pretty close.</p><p>HAMMOND:  And another thing is that seems to be happening is, you know, the  kind of deals that were being done earlier on in the cycle where very  logical ones once ultimate have been told about for a long, long-time.   Now, we are seeing sort of slightly more out-of-the-box ideas come to the  fore.  Is that because people think the window is shutting or is that just  the case that look, investors have been rewarding big tech M&amp;A and so CEO  too missed out in front of cycle of pushing forward to do the deals?</p><p>SHAFIR:  Yes, you're certainly lucky.  You can sort of argue it is a little  bit of both.  I do not view a lot of the stuff that we are seeing, you  know, necessarily as illogical or sort of the double take when you walk by  your Bloomberg terminal, will plug for you guys.  I don't see that.  I  think with activism and with, you know, shareholders really all over  companies today, you know, you get -- John Chambers once told me many years  ago, you get one mistake, I get two.  And I think that really, really bears  on material M&amp;A for CEOs.</p><p>GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Mark, good morning.  Guy in London.   Private equities got a lot of dry powder sitting on the sidelines right  now.  What will JPs (ph) 00:00:30 make of the recent market sell-off in  equities?  Will they see it as an opportunity or something else?</p><p>SHAFIR:  No, look, I think clearly, the interesting thing is, we have seen  the sell-off.  But if you look at multiples, you know, we are still sitting  at sort of the second-highest range.  It's just under 14 times EBITDA and,  you know, for transactions in excess of 200 million, where there is public  reporting.  So it is still an expensive market.</p><p>I do think that if we see a significant correction on the public equity  markets, which I said many time here, we price off, and I think you could  definitely see that, that but it is a lag effect.  You know, sellers are  not going to immediately adjust buyers, want it downside, it goes the  opposite on the upside.  So I think with some lag effect, if this  correction continues, and I think you will see some impact to our pricing,  but that is a six-month or nine-month or a year type phenomenon, it's not  going to occur instantly by any stretch.</p><p>But I do think the dry powder, Guy, the point you make is a very real one.   You know, there's something like a trillion dollars or more, depending upon  who you talk to.  A lot of that has been sponsored, activity has been sort  of selling to each other, and some monetization.  And about 25% or 30% of  it has been, you know, sort of typical, sort of (inaudible) type, the  private stuff.  We would see some of that in an environment where prices  correct somewhat and the strategic pullback a little bit.</p><p>QUINN:  As you sit here, U.S. antitrust enforcers are trying to undo the  AT&amp;T-Time Warner Merger approval in court.  Is this era for regulatory, you  know, sensibilities in the U.S.?</p><p>SHAFIR:  Look, I think it is a fair question.  We saw what CFIUS did early,  you know what CFIUS has done about Broadcom, and Qualcomm, and some other  things.  I do think, we're seeing, you know, we saw an enhancement to the  CFIUS rules earlier in the year, looking at, you know, sort of partial  investments.  We think in the U.K. and Germany, possibly China, so look, I  think we are in a regulatory environment that is more challenging, relative  to what it has been.  How far that goes I think is partially tied up with  trade relations.  And how that will sort itself out.</p><p>HAMMOND:  Is that a surprise, Mark?  Because, this great expectation when  Trump came in that he would be pro-business, it will be a huge boon to the  kind of M&amp;A that have not traditionally been possible particularly under  the previous administration.  Has it been a disappointment for dealmakers?</p><p>SHAFIR:  You know, I do not know that I would say that.  I mean, I think  the sort of a confidence interval around the predictive capability on what  will and will not get through has widened.  I don't know that I say it's  necessarily disappointment.  And I don't know that necessarily blame it on  the administration.  I mean, the fact is, you look at geopolitical  relations around the globe and things have changed.  We are in a more  mercantile environment.</p><p>HAMMOND:  Let's look forward to 2019.  What are the deals do you expect to  see and what sectors are going to really blossom?</p><p>SHAFIR:  You know, look, I think that clearly, you know, we are seeing tech  is going to continue to be an extremely big part of anything we say and do.   And I think partially that will even go through a downturn because of the  disruptive nature of what is going on, Cloud, the data analytic sort of  mobility, all the stuff we -- again, we've talked about ad nauseam.  I do  not think that's going away.</p><p>I do think convergence of media, direct consumer -- all these things really  drive it.  You know, I think we will just have to see how close to the line  these deals are, and what position the various, you know, regulatory bodies  around the globe take.  I do not have a crystal ball.  I wish I did.</p><p>QUINN:  You might have a crystal ball on this one thought because, I think  both the end and want to know about conglomerates and whether there is  going to be more carve outs or scaling up next year?</p><p>SHAFIR:  You know, look, as I said earlier, I mean, the vestiges, breakups  been, you know, in a slower M&amp;A does correlate to sort of you can argue, I  don't want to use the term, cyclical end here because that -- I am not  trying to be overly pessimistic.</p><p>Look, I think there is some correlation.  We would expect that to continue.   We saw the United Technologies announcement.  We've seen some fairly big,  you know the steel chem., specially Chem Steel, Carlisle (ph), Johnson  Controls.  So I do think, you know, this is a phenomenon that will  continue, and it's driven by tech disruption and activism.  And the fact  that I think you know, managements and boards are really holding management  accountable to have a lean and very rational, you know, suite of businesses  as a portfolio.  So it is not going away.</p><p>QUINN:  Our thanks to you, Mark Shafir.</p><p>SHAFIR:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>QUINN:  A very busy co-head of global M&amp;A, he's busy and of course, always  thanks to Bloomberg Ed Hammond, our deals reporter.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">VONNIE QUINN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Now, as we look ahead to 2019, Bloomberg Senior Deals Reporter Ed Hammond joined with Mark Shafir, co-head of global merger and acquisition at Citigroup. Mark, we have to start with this morning's news, the arrest of the Huawei executive and not just the executive but the daughter of the CEO, did it reverberate in the M&amp;A community, what might have mean?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK SHAFIR, CO-HEAD OF GLOBAL M&amp;A AT CITIGROUP: Well, look, I mean, obviously you've seen the impact on the public market. Our market tends to be more trend-oriented, longer-term so the extent, this is indicative of worsening relations, it is not helpful. But I'd say, you know, and to get in the short intermediate run like the 90 day hiatus we have got here nationally on tariffs, I think again, it is not as relevant because of the timeframes we deal in.</p><p>ED HAMMOND, BLOOMBERG NEWS' NEW SENIOR DEALS REPORTER: Mark, it seems to be always your misfortune to come on and talk a moment when we have some negative news flow around the M&amp;A market. Talk to us about the optimism, because there have been a lot of deals in 2018, and the expectation is we have good flow in '19. So when you are talking companies particular here in the U.S., what are the most optimistic about?</p><p>SHAFIR: You know look, I think that when look at it, we generally had a pretty good economy. And so that's -- that particularly in the U.S., those house, you know, and the neighborhood so to speak. So I think that's generally been very positive I think. And as a result, you know, we've seen -- it will be sort of a pretty good year even though we have seen slowing really since the Mark Schaefer (ph) timeframe in terms of monthly volumes. I mean, I think the volumes will be up 20 to 25% on a based case basis, again, we think it will slow next year short of real problems either yield curve inverts, we have problems there economically, or alternatively, you know, of trade relations really worsen. And I think it, you know, sort of all best will be off. But, I think a lot of the optimism has been a pretty decent economy, and that tends to impact the CEO and board confidence.</p><p>HAMMOND: But the kind of deals we're seeing deals suggest that we maybe like cycle. We're seeing, you know, things IBM, Red Hat, interesting field but sort of a classic old company and apparently high-growth. New company which something we typically see anyway. And then you have this other trend which is a huge run-up in spins and the best which is again something we typically see late in the M&amp;A. So do you keep that for us? Where do you guys feel we are?</p><p>SHAFIR: Yes, look, we obviously had a fairly long and decent market here, right? And I do not think anybody can really argue that. I've seen the difference here with this, you know, the old to know is tech disruption, you know, is ubiquitous. And so, I don't know that, you know, the old soft of, you know, some of the old correlations necessarily hold because we spend a lot of time with our tech bankers, you know, talking to in all industries about the impact whether it's industries that are -- you know that have been impacted like travel and leisure, or those, you know, they're more on the come down the road like attractive industries and mining. So, I would discount that a little bit. I don't think you are wrong on the divestiture piece. We correlate pretty well towards, you know, periods where M&amp;A does get a little bit slower, so and 2018 has been a very big year.</p><p>HAMMOND: It's so close for record, right, on that front.</p><p>SHAFIR: It's pretty close.</p><p>HAMMOND: And another thing is that seems to be happening is, you know, the kind of deals that were being done earlier on in the cycle where very logical ones once ultimate have been told about for a long, long-time. Now, we are seeing sort of slightly more out-of-the-box ideas come to the fore. Is that because people think the window is shutting or is that just the case that look, investors have been rewarding big tech M&amp;A and so CEO too missed out in front of cycle of pushing forward to do the deals?</p><p>SHAFIR: Yes, you're certainly lucky. You can sort of argue it is a little bit of both. I do not view a lot of the stuff that we are seeing, you know, necessarily as illogical or sort of the double take when you walk by your Bloomberg terminal, will plug for you guys. I don't see that. I think with activism and with, you know, shareholders really all over companies today, you know, you get -- John Chambers once told me many years ago, you get one mistake, I get two. And I think that really, really bears on material M&amp;A for CEOs.</p><p>GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Mark, good morning. Guy in London.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">VONNIE QUINN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Now, as we look ahead to 2019, Bloomberg Senior Deals Reporter Ed Hammond joined with Mark Shafir, co-head of global merger and acquisition at Citigroup. Mark, we have to start with this morning's news, the arrest of the Huawei executive and not just the executive but the daughter of the CEO, did it reverberate in the M&amp;A community, what might have mean?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK SHAFIR, CO-HEAD OF GLOBAL M&amp;A AT CITIGROUP: Well, look, I mean, obviously you've seen the impact on the public market. Our market tends to be more trend-oriented, longer-term so the extent, this is indicative of worsening relations, it is not helpful. But I'd say, you know, and to get in the short intermediate run like the 90 day hiatus we have got here nationally on tariffs, I think again, it is not as relevant because of the timeframes we deal in.</p><p>ED HAMMOND, BLOOMBERG NEWS' NEW SENIOR DEALS REPORTER: Mark, it seems to be always your misfortune to come on and talk a moment when we have some negative news flow around the M&amp;A market. Talk to us about the optimism, because there have been a lot of deals in 2018, and the expectation is we have good flow in '19. So when you are talking companies particular here in the U.S., what are the most optimistic about?</p><p>SHAFIR: You know look, I think that when look at it, we generally had a pretty good economy. And so that's -- that particularly in the U.S., those house, you know, and the neighborhood so to speak. So I think that's generally been very positive I think. And as a result, you know, we've seen -- it will be sort of a pretty good year even though we have seen slowing really since the Mark Schaefer (ph) timeframe in terms of monthly volumes. I mean, I think the volumes will be up 20 to 25% on a based case basis, again, we think it will slow next year short of real problems either yield curve inverts, we have problems there economically, or alternatively, you know, of trade relations really worsen. And I think it, you know, sort of all best will be off. But, I think a lot of the optimism has been a pretty decent economy, and that tends to impact the CEO and board confidence.</p><p>HAMMOND: But the kind of deals we're seeing deals suggest that we maybe like cycle. We're seeing, you know, things IBM, Red Hat, interesting field but sort of a classic old company and apparently high-growth. New company which something we typically see anyway. And then you have this other trend which is a huge run-up in spins and the best which is again something we typically see late in the M&amp;A. So do you keep that for us? Where do you guys feel we are?</p><p>SHAFIR: Yes, look, we obviously had a fairly long and decent market here, right? And I do not think anybody can really argue that. I've seen the difference here with this, you know, the old to know is tech disruption, you know, is ubiquitous. And so, I don't know that, you know, the old soft of, you know, some of the old correlations necessarily hold because we spend a lot of time with our tech bankers, you know, talking to in all industries about the impact whether it's industries that are -- you know that have been impacted like travel and leisure, or those, you know, they're more on the come down the road like attractive industries and mining. So, I would discount that a little bit. I don't think you are wrong on the divestiture piece. We correlate pretty well towards, you know, periods where M&amp;A does get a little bit slower, so and 2018 has been a very big year.</p><p>HAMMOND: It's so close for record, right, on that front.</p><p>SHAFIR: It's pretty close.</p><p>HAMMOND: And another thing is that seems to be happening is, you know, the kind of deals that were being done earlier on in the cycle where very logical ones once ultimate have been told about for a long, long-time. Now, we are seeing sort of slightly more out-of-the-box ideas come to the fore. Is that because people think the window is shutting or is that just the case that look, investors have been rewarding big tech M&amp;A and so CEO too missed out in front of cycle of pushing forward to do the deals?</p><p>SHAFIR: Yes, you're certainly lucky. You can sort of argue it is a little bit of both. I do not view a lot of the stuff that we are seeing, you know, necessarily as illogical or sort of the double take when you walk by your Bloomberg terminal, will plug for you guys. I don't see that. I think with activism and with, you know, shareholders really all over companies today, you know, you get -- John Chambers once told me many years ago, you get one mistake, I get two. And I think that really, really bears on material M&amp;A for CEOs.</p><p>GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Mark, good morning. Guy in London. Private equities got a lot of dry powder sitting on the sidelines right now. What will JPs (ph) 00:00:30 make of the recent market sell-off in equities? Will they see it as an opportunity or something else?</p><p>SHAFIR: No, look, I think clearly, the interesting thing is, we have seen the sell-off. But if you look at multiples, you know, we are still sitting at sort of the second-highest range. It's just under 14 times EBITDA and, you know, for transactions in excess of 200 million, where there is public reporting. So it is still an expensive market.</p><p>I do think that if we see a significant correction on the public equity markets, which I said many time here, we price off, and I think you could definitely see that, that but it is a lag effect. You know, sellers are not going to immediately adjust buyers, want it downside, it goes the opposite on the upside. So I think with some lag effect, if this correction continues, and I think you will see some impact to our pricing, but that is a six-month or nine-month or a year type phenomenon, it's not going to occur instantly by any stretch.</p><p>But I do think the dry powder, Guy, the point you make is a very real one. You know, there's something like a trillion dollars or more, depending upon who you talk to. A lot of that has been sponsored, activity has been sort of selling to each other, and some monetization. And about 25% or 30% of it has been, you know, sort of typical, sort of (inaudible) type, the private stuff. We would see some of that in an environment where prices correct somewhat and the strategic pullback a little bit.</p><p>QUINN: As you sit here, U.S. antitrust enforcers are trying to undo the AT&amp;T-Time Warner Merger approval in court. Is this era for regulatory, you know, sensibilities in the U.S.?</p><p>SHAFIR: Look, I think it is a fair question. We saw what CFIUS did early, you know what CFIUS has done about Broadcom, and Qualcomm, and some other things. I do think, we're seeing, you know, we saw an enhancement to the CFIUS rules earlier in the year, looking at, you know, sort of partial investments. We think in the U.K. and Germany, possibly China, so look, I think we are in a regulatory environment that is more challenging, relative to what it has been. How far that goes I think is partially tied up with trade relations. And how that will sort itself out.</p><p>HAMMOND: Is that a surprise, Mark? Because, this great expectation when Trump came in that he would be pro-business, it will be a huge boon to the kind of M&amp;A that have not traditionally been possible particularly under the previous administration. Has it been a disappointment for dealmakers?</p><p>SHAFIR: You know, I do not know that I would say that. I mean, I think the sort of a confidence interval around the predictive capability on what will and will not get through has widened. I don't know that I say it's necessarily disappointment. And I don't know that necessarily blame it on the administration. I mean, the fact is, you look at geopolitical relations around the globe and things have changed. We are in a more mercantile environment.</p><p>HAMMOND: Let's look forward to 2019. What are the deals do you expect to see and what sectors are going to really blossom?</p><p>SHAFIR: You know, look, I think that clearly, you know, we are seeing tech is going to continue to be an extremely big part of anything we say and do. And I think partially that will even go through a downturn because of the disruptive nature of what is going on, Cloud, the data analytic sort of mobility, all the stuff we -- again, we've talked about ad nauseam. I do not think that's going away.</p><p>I do think convergence of media, direct consumer -- all these things really drive it. You know, I think we will just have to see how close to the line these deals are, and what position the various, you know, regulatory bodies around the globe take. I do not have a crystal ball. I wish I did.</p><p>QUINN: You might have a crystal ball on this one thought because, I think both the end and want to know about conglomerates and whether there is going to be more carve outs or scaling up next year?</p><p>SHAFIR: You know, look, as I said earlier, I mean, the vestiges, breakups been, you know, in a slower M&amp;A does correlate to sort of you can argue, I don't want to use the term, cyclical end here because that -- I am not trying to be overly pessimistic.</p><p>Look, I think there is some correlation. We would expect that to continue. We saw the United Technologies announcement. We've seen some fairly big, you know the steel chem., specially Chem Steel, Carlisle (ph), Johnson Controls. So I do think, you know, this is a phenomenon that will continue, and it's driven by tech disruption and activism. And the fact that I think you know, managements and boards are really holding management accountable to have a lean and very rational, you know, suite of businesses as a portfolio. So it is not going away.</p><p>QUINN: Our thanks to you, Mark Shafir.</p><p>SHAFIR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>QUINN: A very busy co-head of global M&amp;A, he's busy and of course, always thanks to Bloomberg Ed Hammond, our deals reporter.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

But he's one of a very few for whom the lessons of Augustus's reign have a concrete urgency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both men, after all, built international empires before the age of 33. \"Basically, through a really harsh approach, he established 200 years of world peace,\" Zuckerberg told a reporter earlier this year. \"What are the trade-offs in that?\" Augustus, Zuckerberg explained, \"had to do certain things\" to ensure the stability of his empire. So too, apparently, does Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A 6000-word report published in the New York Times recently disclosed in humiliating detail the lengths to which Facebook has gone to protect its dominance and attack its critics.</p><p>As various interlocking crises concerning hate speech, misinformation, and data privacy widened, top executives ignored, and then kept secret, evidence that the platform had become a vector for misinformation campaigns by government-backed Russian trolls.</p><p>The company mounted a shockingly aggressive lobbying and public-relations campaign, which included creating and circulating pro-Facebook blog posts that were functionally indistinguishable from the \"co-ordinated inauthentic content\" (that is, fake news) Facebook had pledged to eliminate from its platform.</p><p>In one particularly galling example, the company hired a political consultancy that spread a conspiracy theory accusing the powerful Hungarian-American financier and philanthropist George Soros of funding anti-Facebook protests.</p><p>Zuckerberg, it seems, had taken the \"really harsh approach\" to establishing digital hegemony.</p><p>Augustus, at least, was a charismatic leader and confident ruler. No one at Facebook comes across in the Times piece as a similarly bold visionary.</p><p>Not Joel Kaplan, Facebook's top lobbyist, who encouraged the company to suppress and hold back findings of Russian influence campaigns for fear of alienating Republicans. Not (Senator) Chuck Schumer, who confronted one of the Senate's top Facebook critics and told him to figure out how to work with the company. (Schumer's daughter works for Facebook.) Not Sheryl Sandberg, the adult-in-the-room chief operating officer who presided over the entire suspicious and hostile crisis response. And certainly not Zuckerberg, who seems to have been consistently absent -- or plainly uninterested - during key meetings about Facebook's handling of hate speech and misinformation.</p><p>It's hard to be a historical visionary hailed for brokering stability by making morally complex decisions if you can't even be bothered to show up to the morally complex decisions meetings.</p><p>Demands for the CEO to abdicate, or to at least step down from his role as chairman of the board, have increased, but Zuckerberg - who controls 60 per cent of Facebook's voting shares - is no more likely to resign than Augustus would have been.</p><p>As the Wall Street Journal reports, he told company executives earlier this year that Facebook is at war.</p><p>The trouble is that the war may have already been lost. Beset by stagnant growth, low employee morale, plummeting stock, public outrage, and a bipartisan group of enemies in government, the old Facebook, the ever-expanding, government-ignoring, world-conquering company of only a year or two ago, is gone.</p><p>Its own internal surveys bear this out: Facebook was once legendary for the cultish dedication of its employees - reporting on the company was nearly impossible because workers refused to leak - but employee confidence in Facebook's future, as judged by internal surveys reported on by the Journal, is down 32 percentage points over the past year, to 52 per cent.</p><p>Around the same number of Facebook employees think the company is making the world a better place, down 19 points from this time last year, and employees report that they plan to leave Facebook for new jobs earlier than they had in the past.</p><p>Scarier even for Facebook is the possibility, for which there is some anecdotal evidence, that it's no longer a sought-after employer for top computer-science and engineering graduates.</p><p>There's already ample evidence that Facebook is losing its hold on users. In the markets where Facebook is most profitable, its user base is either stagnant, as in North America, or actually shrinking, as in Europe. The company might be able to reassure itself that Instagram - which it wholly owns - is still expanding impressively, but the success of Instagram hasn't stopped Facebook from getting punished on the stock market.</p><p>Facebook blames its shrinking European-user figures not on its faltering public image but on the European Union's aggressive new privacy law. But this raises a more troubling possibility for Facebook: that its continued success is dependent on a soft regulatory touch it can no longer expect from governments.</p><p>What makes the Times revelations particularly dangerous to Zuckerberg's empire is that they arrive at a moment when there is actually the political will to challenge its dominance.</p><p>The fall of Facebook may not come after a long decline but through outside action - slapped with major fines and expensive investigations, chastened and disempowered by a new regulatory regime.</p><p>\"Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself,\" Rhode Island representative David Cicilline - who will likely run the House judiciary subcommittee on anti-trust issues - tweeted recently.</p><p>In the Senate, scepticism regarding tech giants is enough of a bipartisan issue that there appears to be room for an agreement on data protection and user privacy.</p><p>\"I'm not looking to regulate (Zuckerberg) half to death,\" Republican senator John Kennedy said earlier this year, \"but I can tell you this: The issue isn't going away.\" It's true that some Republican critics seem less concerned about Facebook's overwhelming power than about the spurious claims of conservatives that their views are being suppressed on the platform, but there is genuine Republican interest in reining in Facebook.</p><p>Action against big tech companies is a beloved topic of Steve Bannon and his wing of the GOP, and Donald Trump himself, of course, has no particular affection for the company. Trump's Department of Justice, in fact, might represent Facebook's biggest threat.</p><p>The head of the Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, has been singing the praises of the famous DOJ Microsoft antitrust lawsuit.</p><p>As Tim Wu, a former FTC adviser and the author of The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the Gilded Age, puts it, \"Whoever leads the case to break up Facebook will have the political winds and the public at his back\".</p><p>A new Axios poll supports this assessment. Americans have reversed their opinions about social media over the past year, and a majority of Americans across the political spectrum now believe that social media hurts democracy and that the Government isn't doing enough to regulate it.</p><p>It's the public outrage that should be most worrying to Facebook. Other tech giants have managed to escape the opprobrium directed at Facebook because they have obviously useful services. Amazon delivers things to your house. Google helps you find things online. Apple sells actual objects. Facebook \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 helps you get into fights? Delivers your old classmates' political opinions to your brain?</p><p>Amazon is still so unbelievably convenient that the thought of quitting it exhausts me. But I logged out of Facebook more than a year ago and have logged back in fewer than a dozen times since.</p><p>Checking Facebook had been a daily habit, but it also hadn't improved my life or made itself necessary.</p><p>Not many Roman plebes would have said that about the Pax Romana. Some empires fall because they're invaded from the outside or rot from within.</p><p>Zuckerberg's could be the first in history to collapse simply because its citizens logged out.\u00c2\u00a92018 New York Media LLC.

The FTSE 100 index has ended the day down 50 points, or 0.8%, at 6,076 points. Although housebuilders rallied, following strong results from Persimmon, the rise in the pound hurt some London stocks. David Madden of CMC Markets sums up the mood: In a reversal of yesterday's move, the FTSE 100 is being hurt by the strength of the pound. Sentiment in Europe is weak, but the positive move in sterling, has caused the British equity benchmark to underperform. In terms of index points, some of the biggest fallers are GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, British American Tobacco and Unilever - they all earn a large chunk of their revenue overseas, so the upward move in the pound works against them. Tensions between the US and China have heightened again as President Trump has tightened restrictions on Huawei. The US leader wants to limit the Chinese company's access to US-produced chips. The firm was already under scrutiny from the US government, but the heat has been turned up again. European stock markets also lost ground, with France's CAC down 0.7% and Germany's DAX losing 0.3%. And what for Marks &amp; Spencer? Investors have given the struggling retailer's job cuts an early thumbs-down, with M&amp;S shares closing nearly 5% lower at 108p. The news that closing sales (already weak) have tumbled by 305 since stores reopened have reminded traders just how serious the retail crisis has become. Here's the main stories of the day: Goodnight. GW Figures released earlier today have shown that the US housing market continued to recover last month. Housing starts increased by 22.6% - far more than expected - to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.496 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. That suggests that the home construction sector is strengthening, after slowing sharply during the lockdown. Candice Bangsund of asset manager Fiera Capital also credits central banks and politicians for the stunning market rally since late March: \"Global stock markets have made an unprecedented rebound from the depths of the pandemic-induced bear market earlier this year, as investors thrived on the abundance of monetary and fiscal stimulus at hand. Indeed, the timely and assertive response from both central banks and governments proved to be instrumental in alleviating the damage to both the economy and financial markets, and allowed investors to look through the virus-related destruction. At the same time, policymakers' unrelenting pledges to guide the economy back to health have been a critical source of support as major economies fire up their engines and as activity resumes, which has emboldened risk appetite and global equity markets alike.\" Frasers Group, the firm behind Sports Direct, has told the City that chairman David Daly accidentally breached the rules by purchasing shares in the company during its 'closed period'. Top City executives aren't allowed to trade equities in their own firms shortly before financial results are due. Daly, though, seems to have overlooked the rules governing PDMRs (persons discharging managerial responsibilities) and bought 4,000 shares (worth roughly \u00a311,000), a few days before Frasers' final results due on Thursday. In an unusual regulatory statement, the retailer says it was an error, quickly rectified, with the profits from the trade going to charity: Frasers Group was informed on 17th August that David Daly (a Non-Executive Director) of the Company had purchased 3,912 ordinary shares in the Company. The shares were purchased in error during a closed period. The Company has robust procedures in place before PDMRs can trade in shares which were accidentally not followed in this instance. The issue was rectified as soon as it came to the Company's attention and the shares were sold within 15 minutes of their purchase. A small profit was made on the sale which David Daly has donated to charity. The Company will ensure that PDMRs are reminded of their obligations and the internal procedures relating to dealing in the Company's shares. The most obvious threat to the rally is the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 cases this winter. That would put strain on health services, potentially forcing new lockdowns that would hurt businesses (but save lives). But investors are shrugging this risk aside, perhaps confident that governments and central bankers will continue to provide stimulus packages and record low borrowing costs. Adam Vettese, analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, reckons that this will support shares. US stocks have made a remarkable recovery since the big sell-off in mid-March and are continuing to rise despite the unprecedented hit to the global economy. \"There is no doubt that the enormous stimulus packages from the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration have had a major role to play in this and has given investors confidence to stay invested in equities rather than moving into the perceived safety of cash or bonds. \"It's also worth noting that the bulk of the US's recent stock rally has been driven by California-based tech giants, which have not just survived but thrived throughout the coronavirus pandemic. \"The big question now is: how long can US shares keep rising? While that is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty, the big elephant in the room is a potential second wave. \"However, as long as investors remain assured that the US government is prepared to turn on the stimulus taps if necessary, there is no reason why share prices cannot keep rising in the short-term at least. The S&amp;P 500's record high comes as global investors express more optimism about the prospects for the market. A closely watched survey of fund managers from Bank of America shows that investors are \"most bullish\" on financial markets since February. More investors think we're in a \"bull market\" (meaning rising prices, with some corrections on the way), rather than a \"bear market rally\". I suspect some will secretly wish they'd though this earlier - back when the S&amp;5 was somewhat cheaper. As Reuters points out: World stocks have bounced back by a whopping 51%, adding $24 trillion in value, in five months as investors bet that economic activity would rebound rapidly after record plunges. Of the 181 survey participants, who manage half-a-trillion dollars in assets, a net 79% expect a stronger economy, the strongest reading since December 2009. A report issued this morning suggests that the imposition of face coverings in UK supermarkets hit sales, if only temporarily. My colleague Joanna Partridge has the details: Supermarket sales have begun to slow in Great Britain since the easing of lockdown restrictions, as the introduction of compulsory face coverings in stores in England and Scotland initially deterred some shoppers. Take-home grocery sales slowed by 14.4% year-on-year in the three months to 9 August, as more shops and hospitality venues reopened, making consumers less reliant on food retailers, according to the data analysis firm Kantar, which examined shopping trends in England, Scotland and Wales. Kantar said there were 2 million fewer supermarket visits in the week after the face-covering rule was introduced in England than otherwise have been expected. \"It seems to have been an initial blip for shoppers to get used to the new regulations, and actually the trend suggests that they are now recovering back towards the expected levels,\" said Charlotte Scott, the consumer insights director at Kantar. \"[Shopping] trips are now more planned than ever and we have an additional thing to think about and get used to,\" Scott said. Just over half of shoppers told Kantar they felt safe when visiting stores. Traders have predicting for weeks that the S&amp;P 500 would hit a new peak soon. And having finally done it, the index has now subsided. It's currently down 6 points today at 3,375 points (having scaled the previous peak of 3,393). Enterprise software maker Oracle is the top riser on the S&amp;P 500, up 3.5%, following reports that it has joined the crowded race to buy China's TikTok (not an obvious fit, frankly....). Amazon has gained 3%, with CRM software-maker Salesforce.com up 2.3%. The car sector is also solid, with General Motors up 0.5% and Advance Auto Parts rising by 2.2%. Stocks may be rallying, but the US dollar is not! The greenback is continuing to slide on the FX markets, driving the pound up to $1.323 for the first time since the start of January. A strong pound is bad news for Britain's FTSE 100. The index is now down 50 points, or 0.8%, with multinationals weaker (their dollar earnings are less valuable in sterling terms). Here's another handy chart - showing how the US stock market is increasingly dominated by its biggest members: The rally in US shares since March is particularly remarkable, given the surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths, and the sharp rise in unemployment. The rally is, in large parts, down to the central banks, who have convinced investors that they won't allow asset prices to slump. After the crash of late-February and early March, they slashed interest rates to record lows and announced huge stimulus programmes -- including pledging to buy corporate debt to prevent a funding crisis. As you can see, this quickly sparked a revival in the S&amp;P 500, to today's record high of 3394.82. It contains 500 of America's largest listed companies, so is a decent measure of the overall market. Large companies, such as the tech stocks, are among the big beneficiaries. If interest rates will remain low, then firms with solid cash flow and future earnings look particularly attractive. Plus, with government bonds providing meagre returns, equities are more attractive (especially in firms who are still paying a dividend). Also, technology stocks have seen increased demand for their services as the lockdown has accelerated the move towards home-working, collaboration tools, internet shopping and cloud services. As Peter Dixon, Senior Economist at Commerzbank, put it: One of the primary reasons behind the rally in US markets has been the surge in FAANG stocks, which are perceived to have been one of the winners from the lockdown, and which are up more than 70% from the March lows. Here's CNBC on the remarkable stock market rally over the last few months: Since hitting an intraday low on March 23, the S&amp;P 500 has skyrocketed more than 54%. Those gains have been largely driven by sharp advances in Big Tech shares. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft are all up at least 27% year to date. Google-parent Alphabet has jumped more than 14% in that time period. Newsflash: America's S&amp;P 500 share index has just hit a new all-time high. This means the index has now recovered all the losses since the Covid-10 pandemic began. Here's the details from Reuters: S&amp;P 500 TICKS ABOVE 3,393.52 LEVEL, HITS INTRA-DAY RECORD HIGH That's an astonishing recovery, given the S&amp;P 500 fell below the 2,200-point mark back in March. Anyone who held their nerve and bought the index at its lows has seen a roughly 50% gain since. This is despite many companies suffering large drops in sales and profits during the pandemic, and considerable uncertainty over the future. As Liz Ann Sonders of Charles Schwab points out, the index is now its most expensive since the dot-com crash, on a price/earnings level.... The US stock market has opened, and the Nasdaq index of tech stocks has hit a fresh record high. The Nasdaq has gained 49 points, or 0.44%, in early trading, pushing it to 11,179 for the first time. That means the index is up 25% this year, driven by the surge of money into technology giants. The S&amp;P 500 index is also rallying, up 7.4 points to 3,389.41 - very close to its record high (3393.52) set just before the pandemic.... The euro's rally against the US dollar to a two-year high today may cause alarm at the European Central Bank. While a strong currency sounds good in theory, in practice the ECB rather likes a weaker euro as it pushed up inflation (which fell to just 0.3% in June, well below target). Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at Arkera, suspects the ECB may be tempted to talk the currency down.... Back in the markets, the US dollar is weakening against other major currencies. This has driven the pound up nearly a cent, to $1.3194 -- its highest level since early March. The euro has hit its highest level in over two years, at $1.194. The weakness of the dollar is also driving commodity prices higher, with gold back over $2,000 per ounce. The dollar appears to be suffering from predictions that US monetary policy will remain extremely loose for some time, given the damage caused by Covid-19. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with ThinkMarkets, explains: The dollar continues to fall with investors expecting the Fed to maintain its expansionary monetary policy for a long time, owing to concerns the persistence of Covid-19 will weigh on economic recovery. The greenback is also suppressed because of the lack of haven demand for the reserve currency, with investors evidently favouring foreign currencies, gold and bitcoin instead A quick recap The jobs crisis in the UK retail sector has deepened, with Marks &amp; Spencer announcing plans to cut 7,000 jobs before Christmas. M&amp;S is reducing roles at its stores, in its central operations and among regional managers, after a slump in sales during the pandemic. M&amp;S's clothing sales are down 30% since its stores reopened, with rising online sales failing to make up for a plunge in revenues from its stores. CEO Steve Rowe said the changes would create a \"leaner, faster\" business - but shares are down 4% today. Analysts warned that other retailers will follow M&amp;S's move and restructure their own operations, meaning more job losses in traditional retail roles. The opposition Labour party blamed government inaction, and urged ministers to provide targeted support for retail. In other news... The US supermarket giant Walmart has smashed sales forecasts, after nearly doubling its online sales during the pandemic. The UK's discount meals offer is proving very popular... China is threatening Australian wine with new tariffs, in an anti-dumping probe Mining giant BHP Billiton has bowed to pressure from climate activists and agreed to divest its thermal coal mines Back in the UK, the government has announced that at least 35 million discounted meals have been devoured during the Eat Out to Help Out scheme's first fortnight. Rishi Sunak's attempt to protect jobs in the hospitality sector, by offering a discount of up to \u00a310 per head on food and soft drink, is proving rather popular. In the first week, 10.5m meals were claimed back, and the full total claimed has now jumped to 35m (that's not the total number of meals benefiting from the discount, though, as some businesses may not have claimed back yet). The Treasury adds that 85,000 restaurants are offering the scheme. It's received claims from 48,000 outlets, and is urging the rest to get the paperwork in quickly so it can pay them the discount (and add their meals to its running total). Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said: \"Today's figures show that Britain is eating out to help out - with at least 35 million meals served up in the first two weeks alone, that is equivalent to over half of the UK taking part and supporting local jobs in the hospitality sector. \"To build back better we must protect as many jobs as possible, that is why I am urging all registered businesses to make the most of this by claiming back today - it's free, simple and pays out within 5 working days. Shares in Walmart have rallied sharply in premarket trading, up more than 5% to record levels, as investors cheer its forecast-beating results. Here's CNBC's take: Walmart said Tuesday second-quarter earnings got a boost as shoppers rushed in to spend their stimulus checks, while its online business continued to surge during the pandemic. Walmart's e-commerce sales in the US shot up by 97% as customers had packages shipped their homes and used kerbside pick-up. The retailer's US same-store sales grew by 9.3% in the second quarter, fuelled by purchases of food and general merchandise. Shares were up nearly 6% in premarket trading. The US retail giant Walmart has also smashed forecasts, as it rode out the pandemic. Walmart grew its sales by 9.3% in the last quarter, led by \"strength in general merchandise and food\". Its eCommerce sales surged by 97%, as more consumers ordered online. Walmart says: The company's net sales and operating results were significantly affected by a continuation of the global health crisis. Increased demand for products across multiple categories led to strong top-line and gross margin results. While revenues were slightly ahead of estimates, earnings smashed forecasts - at $1.56 a share, versus $1.25 expected. Sticking with the US, retailer Home Depot has posted a surge in sales during the lockdown. Like-for-like sales surged by 23.4% in the May-July quarter, as Americans turned to DIY tasks, snapping up new paint and tools. That's more than double analyst estimates. M&amp;S's struggles are a sharp contrast to the huge success of Amazon, which is hiring more people, in the US. The Wall Street Journal has the details: Amazon.com is expanding its physical offices in six US cities and adding thousands of corporate jobs in those areas, an indication the tech giant is making long-term plans around office work even as other companies embrace lasting remote employment. Amazon is preparing to add 3,500 corporate jobs across hubs in New York, Phoenix, San Diego, Denver, Detroit and Dallas, the company said Tuesday. The plans include 2,000 jobs at the historic building in Manhattan that once housed the Lord &amp; Taylor flagship department store. Sophie Walker, CEO of the Young Women's Trust, points out that women will be disproportionately hit by M&amp;S's job cuts, as they make up 70% of the workforce (details here). Unions are also urging the government to act to protect high street jobs. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), the UK's fifth-largest trades union, has called for urgent talks between the company, the government and unions. Dave Gill, Usdaw National Officer, says the UK also needs an effective industrial strategy: This job loss announcement is yet another devastating blow for M&amp;S staff and yet another bombshell for our high streets. The government has a clear choice; do they want to see the high street go to the wall, or do they want to help save it? What the retail sector needs now is a tripartite approach of the government, unions and employers working together to develop a much-needed retail recovery plan. We have long called for an industrial strategy for retail to help a sector that was already struggling before the coronavirus emergency. Now the situation is much worse. Here's Usdaw's plan to help the high street: Fundamental reform of business rates. The government committed to a review of business rates earlier this year, but assurance is needed that this will not be delayed further. An immediate and comprehensive review of rental values and lease arrangements. In the short term measures are needed to prevent commercial landlords taking legal action for rental defaults during the lockdown period. In the medium term, a rebalancing of the relationship between landlords and tenants is required. Reform of UK tax law to ensure that companies pay their fair share of tax through tackling tax avoidance and the use of offshore havens, with the aim of creating a level playing field between online and high street retailers. Funding for local authorities so they can invest in their local economy, transport networks and high streets. We cannot revive our high streets if core services continue to be undermined Investment in skills for retail workers, including through union learning and high-quality apprenticeships. This should include an in-depth assessment of emerging trends and potential skills shortages/gaps within the sector. A new deal for retail, distribution and home delivery workers based around a real living wage and guaranteed hours. The Labour party has blamed government 'incompetence' for the job cuts at M&amp;S and other retailers. Lucy Powell MP, Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers, says the restructuring shows the need for targeted support for sectors worst hit by the pandemic: These job losses are devastating for the workers involved yet they also tell a much bigger story about the threat to our high streets. The scale of job losses was not inevitable but the incompetence of this government means we're now seeing wave after wave of redundancies, and store closures. Labour has called for a Hospitality and High Streets Fightback Fund to support businesses in distress and to save jobs now. Ministers must change course. Employees at other high street retailers will be watching events at M&amp;S nervously. Although every chain is different, they all face the consequences of the accelerated move towards online shopping and away from store visits - especially during the ongoing pandemic. Freddy Khalastchi, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, predicts more 'radical restructuring' from rival retailers (on top of the cuts already announced): \"Consumer shopping habits have transformed during the pandemic. As a result, many bricks and mortar retailers have been forced to take drastic action to rightsize their business models by stripping away superfluous layers of management and back office support services. Coming on top of 950 job losses announced last month by the retailer, this development is a significant step that may well encourage others to bring forward radical restructuring plans in the next few months.\" It's been a choppy morning's trading in the City of London. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares fell initially, but has now recovered its losses to sit unchanged at 6126 points. The French, German, Spanish and Italian markets are all slightly higher, though. Housebuilder Persimmon is the top riser in London, up 5% after reporting a strong pick-up in demand since the pandemic eased. But M&amp;S is still struggling after announcing sweeping job cuts, down 4% towards the bottom of the FTSE 250 leaderboard of smaller listed companies. The worst performer is outsourcing group Capita, which have plunged almost 10% after reporting a \u00a328.5 loss due to the pandemic. Capita warned: COVID-19 impact has come in a pivotal year for Capita when we expected to see revenue growth. Profit has been significantly affected and the delay in the return to growth means we will not generate sustainable cash flow for 1-2 years Marks &amp; Spencer's future prospects depend heavily on the success of its new tie-up with Ocado. That partnership starts next month, and will let people order M&amp;S food for home delivery through Ocado (supplanting Waitrose). Russ Mould of stockbrokers AJ Bell says M&amp;S needs the Ocado deal to work, fast: \"The company should thank its lucky stars that it has a successful food arm, as that has helped to prop up trading during a very difficult time. Its clothing and home interests have struggled in the face of serious headwinds as demand fell off a cliff for office dressing and formal wear. \"The next big test for Marks &amp; Spencer will be the imminent launch of its supply deal with Ocado for UK online food orders. A lot is riding on this joint venture being a success and further accelerating growth in Marks &amp; Spencer's food sales. \"This is the retailer's chance to play catch-up with the online channel and failure to meet expectations could be disastrous for both management and the company's already fragile share price. \"Marks &amp; Spencer has been in turnaround mode for a long time and a lot of its effort has been spent trying to fix things rather than come up with new ideas. The Ocado deal is different as it is new territory for the group. Getting this venture off to a strong start could fuel optimism that the retailer is still capable of moving with the times rather than sinking into quicksand.\" Speaking of Australia.... the country's wine industry is facing the threat of new tariffs on sales to the fast-growing Chinese market. China has begun an anti-dumping probe into imports of Australian wine in a move that will likely worsen tensions between the two countries. It sent shares in Australian winemakers sharply lower today. The probe was prompted by complaints from the Chinese Alcoholic Drinks Association that Australian wine producers had cut their prices unfairly low, hurting domestic producers. More here: In the mining sector, BHP Billiton has pledged to sell its thermal coalmines within two years. It's part of the global mining giant's push for a low-carbon future, following heavy pressure from investors to clean up its business. From Australia, my colleague Ben Butler reports: Announcing a full-year profit of US$7.95bn on Tuesday, BHP chief executive Mike Henry also left the door open to supporting a resolution from activist shareholders that would require BHP to stop mining that would destroy Aboriginal cultural heritage sites in Australia until laws are changed to strengthen their protection. Henry said BHP agreed with the intent of the resolution, which was to prevent \"another Juukan Gorge\" - a reference to rival miner Rio Tinto's decision to blow up 46,000-year-old-caves in the Pilbara to get access to higher quality iron ore. While retailers struggle, housebuilders are hopeful that conditions in their sector are improving. Persimmon, the UK's biggest home builder, restored its dividend this morning after reporting that business has picked up strongly this summer. CEO Dave Jenkinson told the City that weekly sales were nearly 50% higher since the construction sector ended its lockdown, with Persimmon's order book also swelling. The Group has had an excellent start to the second half with a c. 49% year on year increase in average weekly private sales rates per site since the start of July and a current forward order book of c. \u00a32.5bn, a 21% increase on last year. The pandemic has been costly, with Persimmon's pre-tax profits for the first six months of 2020 down 43%, from \u00a3509m to \u00a3292m. Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have fallen by almost 4% in morning trading, down 4.4p to 109.2p. That suggests investors are underwhelmed by M&amp;S's latest attempt to transform the business. M&amp;S's share have almost halved in value so far this year (the broader market is down almost 20%). Julie Palmer, partner and restructuring expert at Begbies Traynor, says M&amp;S's job cuts highlight the 'huge structural change' in UK spending habits. With more people shopping online - retailers need fewer people in the stores, and more people shipping goods to customers' homes. \"This is a huge transformation for the brand. And one that is needed because consumers have become used to the convenience of shopping during lockdown. The movement of shop floor jobs to warehouse jobs, stronger emphasis on logistics and a greater wealth of talent that can support the online offering will be where the jobs in retail start to appear. The increase in technology in the workplace to streamline organisations will also become more commonplace as retail moves towards its future structure. Clothing has been the weak side of M&amp;S's business for many years, with food sales consistently stronger. Covid-19 appears to have accelerated that trend, leading to this morning's job cuts. As John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, says: \"Today's announcement, while difficult for the staff involved at M&amp;S, has been a long time in the making. The company's fall from established FTSE 100 constituent to mid-cap has reflected past strategic errors; but, more recently, the business had been going through significant changes even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Indeed, the measures taken today underline the degree to which the economic impact of the virus has super-accelerated many of the trends that were already sweeping through retail and other sectors. The hope will be that M&amp;S, one of the UK's most iconic brands, emerges from this process a stronger, more future-proof business on the other side - but the next few months will be tough for the company and its staff.\" Retail analyst Nick Bubb says: M&amp;S Food sales are doing quite well, but M&amp;S Clothing &amp; Home sales are very weak and so it is no surprise to see the business set out big cost-cutting plans, dressed up as \"streamlining\"... M&amp;S's job cuts look to be the most severe announced by a UK company since the pandemic drove the economy into its worst recession in decades. But many other retailers have also made sweeping redundancies and store closures. For example: Debenhams announced 2,500 job cuts last week, on top of 4,000 in April Boots is cutting 4,000 roles, and closing 48 opticians outlets. WH Smith is cutting 1,500 jobs, after its high street and airport stores were hit by falling sales. SSP, the owner of Upper Crust and Caff\u00e8 Ritazza, said in July it was axing 5,000 jobs out of its 9,000 UK workforce High-end department store Harrods announced 700 job cuts; Selfridges cut 450, and Arcadia is losing 500 Electricals retailer Dixons Carphone is losing 800 managers Clothing chain M&amp;Co is cutting 400 jobs Other companies slashing jobs include: Aerospace manufacturer Airbus, which is cutting 1,700 UK jobs out of 15,000 global layoffs Foreign exchange firm Travelex, which collapsed into administration two weeks ago, with the immediate loss of more than 1,300 jobs. Fitness and gymwear firm DW Sports collapsed this month, putting 1,700 jobs at risk Tour operator Hays Travel announced almost 900 redundancies, following the government's tighter quarantine rules on holidays to Spain The Evening Standard, which is cutting 115 jobs after advertising tumbled If you're just tuning in, here's the details of M&amp;S's major job cuts plan, announced at 7am. Marks &amp; Spencer is to cut around 7,000 jobs over the next three months, in the latest round of redundancies at the retailer as it cuts costs and changes the business following the pandemic. The job cuts will be in its central support centre, regional management, and its UK stores, adding to the swathe of job cuts announced by UK companies during the Covid-19 crisis. M&amp;S said it expects a \"significant proportion\" of the job losses will be made through voluntary redundancies or early retirement, and has begun consultations with staff. The clothing, food and homeware retailer said what it called a \"streamlining programme\" was a important step in reducing its costs, and allowing it to emerge from the coronavirus crisis with a lower cost base and more resilient business. Marks &amp; Spencer's chief executive Steve Rowe said the job cuts were part of its previously-announced plans to \"learn from the crisis, accelerate our transformation and deliver a stronger, more agile business in a world in which some customer habits were changed forever plans\". \"The outlook is uncertain and we remain cautious,\" Rowe said, \"these proposals are an important step in becoming a leaner, faster business set up to serve changing customer needs and we are committed to supporting colleagues through this time.\" Marks &amp; Spencer is 'desperately' trying to adjust to the new Covid-19 world by slashing 7,000 jobs across its business, says Richard Lim, CEO of Retail Economics. He also fears many more jobs will go, as the government's furlough scheme winds up this autumn: \"This is a massive reduction in their workforce and the retailer is desperately attempting to reposition the business towards a new normal emerging in the sector. This painful readjustment period will see a significant reduction in labour costs, cutting back on store numbers and pivoting the business model to become nimbler and more digitally focused. \"Retailers were already battling with the pace of structural change facing the sector but the impact of the pandemic has been a step-change for the industry. Retailers remain in survival mode, preserving cash and hanging on for more sustainable levels of demand to return. But the way we shop has changed on a permanent basis for many parts of the sector almost overnight. The reality is that many more retailers will fail and the number of job losses will ramp up as government support is withdrawn. This is the calm before the storm.\" Here's more reaction, from Graham Hiscott of the Daily Mirror: The BBC's Sally Bundock tweets: The scale of the slump in M&amp;S's clothing and homeware business is quite stunning -- down almost 30% since stores reopened in mid-June. Over the last eight weeks, in-stores sales are down 47.9% compared with a year ago. Online sales are strongly higher, up 39.2%, but that still leaves total sales 29.9% lower. So even though food revenues are up, total revenues are 10% lower over the last eight weeks: M&amp;S says demand for smarter clothes has tailed off dramatically this year (with so few people going to the office or attending parties and weddings). The performance of store sales has varied widely across the estate with some of the newer out of town stores trading close to last year's level of sales overall in recent weeks but legacy town centre stores and some shopping centres still heavily impacted by social distancing and reduced footfall. Furthermore, with the closure of many workplaces and lack of social gatherings, the clothing sales mix has seen a substantial shift from office dressing and formal wear into casual clothing and leisure wear. Marks &amp; Spencer's CEO Steve Rowe is blaming the 'uncertain outlook' for today's huge job cuts. In this morning's statement, he tells shareholders: \"In May we outlined our plans to learn from the crisis, accelerate our transformation and deliver a stronger, more agile business in a world in which some customer habits were changed forever. Three months on and our Never the Same Again programme is progressing; albeit the outlook is uncertain and we remain cautious. As part of our Never The Same Again programme to embed the positive changes in ways of working through the crisis, we are today announcing proposals to further streamline store operations and management structures. These proposals are an important step in becoming a leaner, faster business set up to serve changing customer needs and we are committed to supporting colleagues through this time.\" M&amp;S says it's also planning to create some new jobs as part of this streamlining plan, but there's no details of how many. It says: Concurrently we expect to create a number of new jobs as we invest in online fulfilment and the new ambient food warehouse and reshape our store portfolio over the course of the year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some grim breaking news to start the morning - Marks &amp; Spencer is preparing to cut almost 7,000 jobs. The high street chain has just announced it is starting a \"multi-level consultation programme\", after being badly hit by the slump in retail spending during the Covid-19 pandemic. The job cuts will hit workers at M&amp;S's stores across the UK, as well as at its central support centre and in regional management. It will add to the tens of thousands of jobs already lost, or at risk, across the UK economy. In a statement to the City, M&amp;S warns that sales of clothes and homeware are sharply lower than a year ago - meaning it must shake up its business. It says: As previously outlined Clothing &amp; Home trading in the stores remains well below last year, with online and home delivery strong. It is clear that there has been a material shift in trade and whilst it is too early to predict with precision where a new post Covid sales mix will settle, we must act now to reflect this change. We have also learnt that we can work more flexibly and productively with more colleagues multi-tasking and transitioning between Food and Clothing &amp; Home. The deployment of our leading store technology package developed in partnership with Microsoft has also enabled us to reduce layers of management and overheads in the support office. M&amp;S hopes that \"a significant proportion will be through voluntary departures and early retirement\", adding: In line with our longstanding value of treating our people well, we will now begin an extensive programme of communication with colleagues. More details and reaction to follow.... Also coming up It's a busy day for US retailers, with Walmart, Kohl's &amp; Home Depot all posting results. That'll show whether sales have picked up since the lockdown eased. We also get a healthcheck on the US property market, with the latest figures for building permits and new home construction.

This prospect has spurred companies to preemptively <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/25/google-privacy-regulation-senate-hearing/\">draft</url> privacy legislation, to jump in front of whatever more draconian measures politicians might devise.<br/>Big Tech is shrewd to move first. Congress has been quick to vent anger against Facebook and its ilk, but it hasn't yet developed policy that might channel its rage. Senator Mark Warner is an exception to this slow-footedness. This summer, he circulated a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://graphics.axios.com/pdf/PlatformPolicyPaper.pdf\">white paper</url> that laid out a comprehensive critique of these companies, and it named names: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Twitter.</p><p><br/>His paper argues, \"The speed with which these products have grown and come to dominate nearly every aspect of our social, political and economic lives has in many ways obscured the shortcomings of their creators in anticipating the harmful effects of their use.\" Warner followed a fairly sweeping diagnosis with a lengthy compendium of potential solutions to curb the proliferation of misinformation and propaganda, to protect the privacy of users, and to preserve a competitive marketplace. He explored the possibilities of imposing European-style privacy regulations and allowing those defamed on social media to bring cases against tech companies under state tort laws.  <br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/09/mark-zuckerbergs-case-against-regulating-facebook/569791/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Mark Zuckerberg's case against regulating Facebook.</url>]<br/>I met with Warner in his Senate office to discuss his thinking. Warner comes from tech. In the '90s, he earned a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/technology/mark-warner-tech-critic-russia.html\">fortune</url> as an investor in hugely successful telecommunications companies. He dresses the part. When I entered his inner sanctum, he was wearing blue jeans and Allbirds, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/technology/allbird-shoes-silicon-valley.html\">famously favored footwear</url> of the Google co-founder Larry Page and the former Twitter chief Dick Costolo. And, of course, he wore an Apple Watch on his wrist. Unlike other senatorial dens that are crammed with home-state kitsch and stodgy neoclassical touches, Warner's maintains an ostentatiously minimalistic look: A giant abstract canvas hovers above his tidy desk.<br/>Before we chatted, Warner issued a self-deprecatory warning: \"I have a tendency to zig and zag in conversation.\" He said his style of thinking aloud didn't always translate well to paper. Our exchange, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.  <br/><br/>Franklin Foer: In the public's mind, you're a pro-tech centrist. Yet you've come up with a fairly sweeping critique of Big Tech. Was there a trigger point that shifted you?<br/>Mark Warner: I still believe myself to be a very tech-friendly policy maker. But I was rubbed the wrong way by the arrogance of the technology companies and the presumption that they knew what was best for everyone. There was this whole idea: You policy guys just shouldn't worry. We're a lot smarter. We'll take care of things. And particularly as we got into the social-media era, there was an infatuation with some of these companies in [Silicon] Valley in the Obama administration. But even in the Obama years, I was starting to see some of what I thought was the dark underbelly.<br/>Foer: What did you see?<br/>Warner: Well, I saw from my three girls, from my own family's basis, the almost addictive tendencies of devices. I saw how an unedited public square often allowed extremist voices to connect with other extremists in a way that multiplied their volume, far beyond what they actually represent. I saw the proliferation of bots manipulating political conversation. And then there was also a point when I got pretty pissed off. I was seeing evidence of foreign intervention on the social-media platforms. I've met with Mark Zuckerberg a half-dozen times, decent enough guy, but there was such an arrogant kind of response to complaints: \"Anybody who'd say that doesn't understand.\"<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/raised-by-youtube/570838/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Raised by YouTube</url>]<br/>Foer: Were you seeing foreign intervention before the election itself?<br/>Warner: I wasn't seeing it actively. You heard rumors.  <br/>Foer: Did you bring those rumors to Zuckerberg before the election?<br/>Warner: No. And I think there was also this kind of arrogance among Democrats about tech in the campaign, since Obama had been such a tech guy. In 2008, we smoked [the Republicans]. There was more equality between the presidential campaigns in 2012. But when it came to tech, there was a gross underestimation of the Trump campaign's savvy.<br/>Foer: Let's start with the public square. At the core of so much unhappiness with the internet is its toxicity. But then we're in such complicated territory. Speech is running through these platforms. How do we think about cleaning them up without sacrificing core liberal values?<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/the-most-powerful-publishers-in-the-world-dont-give-a-damn/567095/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The most powerful publishers in the world don't give a damn.</url>]<br/>Warner: In the late '90s, when these platforms were being created,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act\">Section 230</url> of the Communications Decency Act made a lot of sense. Platforms were neutral; they were just a way to have information flow freely into the public square. We couldn't hold the platforms responsible for that free flow. But somehow, by around 2016, more than half of the American people were getting their news from Facebook, let alone social media at large. Suddenly, that 1990s framework might not be exactly right.<br/>The social-media companies fight any changes to Section 230 as if it will provoke the complete destruction of the public square. Obviously, that is not the case. Because there have been changes. There have been changes around child pornography. And you can't print how to make a bomb. Most recently, we've imposed restrictions around sex trafficking.<br/>Some of my colleagues have been very active in this space. I don't want to steal their ideas. But perhaps there is a decency doctrine that might be industry-administered. Or is there some kind of mechanism we could impose that would say, if you don't have some kind of self-cleanup, there will be legislative changes?<br/>Foer: Isn't there a danger of a slippery slope, where the government gets involved in regulating speech?<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/two-concepts-of-freedom-of-speech/546791/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The two clashing meanings of free speech</url>]<br/>Warner: But with foreign influence, we couldn't get Congress to move. The companies have finally started to self-regulate with paid political advertising. But we've really not moved beyond that.<br/>Foer: Why, as we make these initial forays into regulating this space, shouldn't we start to worry about threats to speech?<br/>Warner: We've had pretty vigorous debates within published-news organizations, within traditional edited publications about what constitutes acceptable speech. It hasn't limited free speech. And, of course, you can't scream \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater. How far should we go down the path of regulating these spaces? I think you can have that debate without seriously undermining the public square. And I think the companies are starting to realize it is in their self-interest to be part of this discussion. Look at the number of people, particularly younger people, who are bailing on these platforms because of the preponderance of bots and this disproportionate screeching on either end of the political spectrum.<br/>Foer: Isn't it a fiction to claim that tech platforms are a public square? Because, in reality, there's so much invisible manipulation and editing that shapes discourse on them?<br/>Warner: Yeah. And I think there is another false premise that most people have not fully understood. They think these services are all free. They're not free. They are taking your personal information, which gives them value to then sell to advertisers. But where's the transparency about the price of this exchange? I mean, there's less price transparency on the internet than there is in health care. And look how screwed up that market is.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/timeline-tech-industry-leaks/572593/?utm_source=feed\">Read: A timeline of tech-industry leaks</url>]<br/>Foer:  I just came back from Europe and the European Union has new privacy rules, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It's supposed to create transparency. But as I navigated the web from Europe, what I saw is a patina of responsibility, accountability, and transparency, but also massive amounts of bureaucracy. All these things that are supposed to be easy are actually quite hard for users.<br/>Warner: One hundred percent. GDPR, I think, went over the top. And it did layer on too much of a bureaucratic structure, and not in a user-friendly way. We're still relatively early in implementation, so will there be improvements? Maybe. But that's one of the reasons I'm still open to market-based solutions.<br/>Foer: I'm skeptical of market-based solutions. Listening to the tech executives and the way that they've dissembled, it's hard to trust them to self-regulate.<br/>Warner: Agreed. But here's my concern: that there may be so much clunkiness with GPDR that it becomes a proxy for old-style government regulation.<br/>Foer: What type of old-style government regulation do you fear?<br/>Warner: There's a normal process for a regulatory agency to make a rule. By the time you make a rule, the technology's passed it by. So here's an idea. I even put it in the paper. Is there an analogy, and it's not by any means perfect, to the securities world? Finance has lots of complexity. But you do have an entity like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Industry_Regulatory_Authority\">FINRA</url>. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is an industry-run group that self-regulates. It is literally a first line of defense, more minimal than the Securities and Exchange Commission. I think you will need a government backstop. But is there a way to think about the first line of defense, a set of rules that might not necessarily be government regulation, but the industry policing itself? And I'm not sure that would work, but it would be something to think about.<br/>Foer: When senators took a lot of heat for the Facebook hearing, I actually thought they did a pretty decent job.<br/>Warner: The first one?<br/>Foer: Yeah.<br/>Warner: You're a minority of one.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/04/zuck/557717/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The Senate tries to figure out Facebook.</url>]<br/>Foer: You know better than me. But take finance or air-traffic control, both very complicated things. When you hold hearings on them, you're going to seem like a generalist, right? It's hard to be a senator and be an expert on complicated systems. And yet we find some sort of way to regulate those systems. The finance example seems to me a pretty good one. There might be many problems in the way we regulate finance, but we also find ways to make the world safer for investors and consumers.<br/>Warner: And clearly we have not limited innovation in finance. One of my concerns in this: that we set an American regulatory regime, or an American/European, or even an American/Western regime. Most of these companies now, the main leaders, are American. And we hobble them. Then these Chinese entities that aren't constrained by these restrictions take the market, steal the market-with even worse perversions in terms of privacy or government manipulation. I would also make a critique of some of the tech companies that, because of their desire to break into the Chinese market, are willing to sacrifice the family jewels.<br/>Foer: Should we be putting greater pressure on these companies to not go into China, given the risks?<br/>Warner: I think there needs to be a higher-level conversation warning the companies, so they can't later claim, \"Well, we didn't know.\" And I think there are serious questions when you have American companies doing joint intellectual development around AI products in a country like China. We didn't see the American military-industrial complex doing joint nuclear-bomb development with the Soviet Union.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/the-pentagon-wants-to-weaponize-the-brain-what-could-go-wrong/570841/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The Pentagon's push to program soldier's brains</url>]<br/>Foer: Right.<br/>Warner: We just passed a defense budget of $713 billion, biggest one ever. China has a defense budget of roughly $150 billion. China is spending the difference between the two budgets on AI, quantum computing, 5G-a series of other areas where we should be taking the lead. We're buying the world's best 20th-century military. But in the realm of cyber and disinformation, our competitors are already our peers, if not better.<br/>What we saw in 2016, and what we've seen recently, is what I would call \"first-stage manipulation.\" You suck in an individual based on a traditional phishing expedition. But I see a second stage. This is where you have a hack like the cyberpenetration of the credit agency Equifax. A foreign entity or someone comes in, amasses a huge amount of personalized information. They contact us with data that would clearly make us respond, because it is our personal information. We will be greeted with a fake video of a trusted individual, whether it is a politician, a market maker, or a CEO. And then you've got the possibility of mass chaos.<br/>Foer: Yikes!<br/>Warner: From a governmental standpoint and from a platform-company standpoint, people will acknowledge that possibility, but nobody's doing enough to prep for that world.<br/>Foer: Why are we so slow-footed when it comes to protecting ourselves in this sort of way?<br/>Warner: The Kauffman Foundation has pointed out since about 1990 that 80 to 85 percent of all net new jobs have been created by start-ups. Now, not all start-ups are technology based, but the start-ups that have captured our attention are the Facebooks and Googles. So this has been a job creator. It has been a job creator that's also captured the imagination of the Millennials and the younger generations. Not only the Valley and the tech companies disdain regulation, but frankly there's been our own kids' disdain. A sense that government and politicians don't understand it. And it has been a tenet of the Republican Party that you don't regulate. Regulation by nature is bad. And that's until everything hits the fan and then you-<br/>Foer: But it did hit the fan!<br/>Warner: And we're still only talking, not acting. Back to my paper, I think there are still coalitions to be built here. I know, Frank, you've got antitrust ideas. I'm not convinced those are the right solutions yet. I am also concerned about competition from China. And perhaps there is a way that market forces can come in and help get us some of our goals. And that's where price transparency comes in.<br/>Foer: But you talked about some of the errors that you witnessed. And there's so much carelessness when it comes to the management of the public square, the management of data. Why not establish countervailing powers here? The companies have operated with impunity because there's no sense that they're ever going to be held accountable.<br/>Warner: I think there is a recognition that the beast is awakening in terms of the government. There's going to be an outcry, and we're one event away from a reaction, maybe an overreaction, from the government. You've already got Europe acting on GDPR, and you have California starting to act on questions around identity and bots. So I think they're realizing going back to the old days isn't going to work. Some of the older incumbents in tech are starting to get that they've got to change.<br/>Foer: Let's talk about Amazon. You have this very, very dominant firm that is going to be setting the agenda for the future of work. How do you think about Amazon?<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/alexa-how-will-you-change-us/570844/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Alexa, should we trust you?</url>]<br/>Warner: I think that you have traditional product companies where the ability to invent a better product always exists. With Amazon, you have a company that's less about product; it's more just incredibly successful execution skills. Plus a lot of data. Compare that to Facebook and Google: Is there ever an ability to really break up their market dominance? Even if you've got a better app, you can never match them on data. Look at the number of companies that are going public within technology right now. It has dramatically declined. If you look at the app world, your whole plan is an exit to Facebook and Google. I'm not sure that's the healthiest ecosystem.<br/>Foer: It feels like the Democratic Party, which, as you said, was asleep with these issues for a very long time, is starting to awaken. There will be a big debate about where the Democratic Party positions itself in relationship to the market.<br/>Warner: It's going to be fascinating from just the pure political end to see those who rightfully question the size and power of any large company, to see how far they're willing to go, particularly if they're talking about a 20th-century toolbox of policies to use against them. Especially if you contrast that to the normal affinity the vast majority of Millennials and younger generations still have for these companies.<br/>Foer: So you think there's a risk that the Democrats overshoot and alienate Millennials by being too tough on tech?<br/>Warner: Yeah. I've done a lot of work and thinking around the future of work. I've convened sessions where I've brought companies and advocates to talk about the gig economy. Some of my Democratic colleagues' reaction was, \"Oh, this episodic work-on-demand is horrible. We need to think about this whole issue in the context of 20th-century labor, classic labor classification, and try to move everybody back into it.\" And one of my other colleagues, on the younger side, stood up and said, \"Before we go against all of these new companies and try to turn this into a 20th-century battle, every one of you senators needs to go back and ask your whole staff how many of them use Airbnb or Uber or Lyft.\" This was about three years ago. And I think there's concern that if somehow you simply look at 20th-century solutions, you can appear anti-future, anti-tech.<br/>Foer: You're an expert on the abuse of data and the ambiguity of surveillance. Are there ways in which your own relationship to technology has shifted as you've started to analyze these questions? Are there devices that you won't allow into your house?<br/>Warner: I actually know more than even most because of the nature of being on the Intelligence Committee. So I've gotten better in terms of personal cyber and tech hygiene. But frankly, I'm not as good as I should be. I have not taken the Alexa completely out. We have it mostly turned off; we have it mostly unplugged. We have not gone cold turkey on some of the tools, but I'm safer on how I use them. And it's one of the reasons why I'm still very frustrated, especially as we move into Internet of Things-connected devices. I have the most recent estimate: We're about 20 billion connected devices now; we'll be at 500 billion within a decade. We're creating all these devices right now, but with minimal security built in. It's just insanity.<br/>Foer: It's a hacker's delight.<br/>Warner: Guaranteed hacker incomes.<br/>Foer: So about nine months ago, when Al Franken was still in the Senate, he invited me to his office because he had read my book. And he was comically wringing his hands about how as soon as he gave a speech taking on these companies, they were going to come at him. Is there a cost to politicians tangling with these companies?<br/>Warner: There's clearly been a reluctance to take them on. I think because I've got some tech background, they haven't viewed me as a total adversary. I've tried not to constantly demonize them. And I've said, \"If you leave it to us, we're going to screw it up. So come work with us.\" They clearly all realized how annoyed I was-and a huge number of members up here-when they failed to acknowledge the Russian intervention. And in their first eight or nine months of dealing with the controversy, their response was pathetic. All of them. But I've not felt the political price yet. The jury's out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-markwarneriscomingfortechstoopowerful572695</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TG6-1J91-DYY9-J00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3220\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Sitting in his basement office at the Capitol last week, he leaned forward in his chair, waved his hands in the air and pounded his fingers on the coffee table.</p><p>He was talking about how some of the biggest American technology companies, like Facebook, Google and Twitter, were used to spread foreign propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. And he wanted to make clear that those businesses had made major mistakes before and after the election.</p><p>Not only were Russian-linked accounts able to take advantage of the services, Mr. Warner said. The tech companies also took months to hand over information about those accounts. And he is still not convinced, he said, that the businesses are revealing everything they know about how their products were manipulated.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve grown so quickly,\u201d said Mr. Warner, 62, a Democrat from Virginia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019ve fully realized the implications of all their power.\u201d</p><p>This week, Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will push for new answers. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are set to testify at congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday about the election and the power of their platforms.</p><p>Lawmakers are increasingly taking a critical tone with Silicon Valley, with Mr. Warner among the harshest. He has already pushed a bill requiring the companies to disclose who paid for digital political ads, the biggest legislative effort so far to regulate the companies.</p><p>Mr. Warner\u2019s position is a sharp reversal. Before entering politics, he built a fortune that at one time was estimated at around $200 million as a technology and telecommunications investor and executive. His political identity, first as governor of Virginia and then as a senator, has been wrapped in promises to bring 21st century jobs. He has a broad and close network of tech executives and investors.</p><p>Mr. Warner is emblematic of the shifting politics for technology.</p><p>\u201cMark didn\u2019t come to this point with the social media companies lightly,\u201d said <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/saxby_chambliss/index.html\">Saxby Chambliss</url>, a retired Republican senator from Georgia who regularly meets with Mr. Warner and the Intelligence Committee chairman, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, a Republican, to discuss the Russia investigation.</p><p>The reluctance of the technology companies to take seriously <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/us/politics/senate-intelligence-committee-russia-election-trump.html\">the investigation into Russian election meddling</url> pushed Mr. Warner over the edge, Mr. Chambliss said.</p><p>\u201cThat is a poor attitude for American companies,\u201d Mr. Chambliss added. \u201cMark will make sure this issue is highlighted because it needs to stop.\u201d</p><p>Ahead of the hearings, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/technology/twitter-russia-today-sputnik.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">Twitter</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/technology/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-ads.html\">Facebook</url> have scrambled to disarm lawmakers with announcements of voluntary changes to their advertising businesses.

In their announcements on voluntary ad disclosures, Twitter and Facebook said their stricter policies for who can place political ads and promises to make those purchases public are signs of their commitment to correcting their mistakes.</p><p>\u201cWe look forward to answering lawmakers\u2019 questions,\u201d said Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy for Facebook, in a statement. \u201cWe take this issue very seriously and think it\u2019s important Congress gets the full picture of what happened, including what we know about Russian activity on our platform, and is able to share its assessment with the American public.\u201d</p><p>But lawmakers said the companies, who have been interacting privately for months, still have a long way to go.</p><p>Last week, congressional aides said the online giants were pushing back against lawmakers. The companies argued against the ad disclosure bill and dragged their feet to participate in a hearing on Tuesday. Lobbyists for Facebook explained how their voluntary efforts on political ad disclosures could work better than regulations.</p><p>Twitter has not addressed its problems with automated accounts, known as bots, that can quickly spread propaganda or fake news. In addition, not all social media companies have announced that they will tighten rules for buying political ads, one of the most pressing issues. And even if they do, lawmakers should still make more disclosure a legal requirement, said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-sponsor of the disclosure bill with Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.</p><p>\u201cIf their policies comply with our bill, they should support our bill and maybe can use their policy as a standard when we pass our bill,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.</p><p>Much of the harshest criticism so far is coming from Democrats like Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar, which could limit the fallout for the tech companies. The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr, has been more reserved than Mr. Warner, for example.</p><p>Many Republicans are reluctant to add any regulations to businesses. Some are also afraid of crossing other party members or President Trump, who regularly play down Russian interference in the election.</p><p>Republicans have slowly begun calling for more scrutiny of the companies. But lawmakers who are more oriented toward free markets have been reluctant to regulate the rapidly evolving industry. Other top regulators, particularly those appointed by Mr. Trump, are also considered unlikely to take strong action against the industry.</p><p>The top antitrust enforcer at the Justice Department, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/technology/how-trumps-pick-for-top-antitrust-cop-may-shape-competition.html\">Makan Delrahim</url>, said in an interview last week that his agency would watch to see whether the size of technology companies hurts competition, but that size alone was not justification for action against them.</p><p>\u201cThere are people who think big is just bad,\u201d Mr. Delrahim said. He invoked the name of Robert Jackson, the top antitrust enforcer for the agency about 80 years ago, who said he was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.roberthjackson.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Should_the_Antitrust_Laws_Be_Revised_.pdf\">reluctant to try to break up big companies</url> just for the sake of doing so.</p><p>That has made it easier for Mr. Warner to assert himself as a leading voice about the power of the tech companies \u2014 as unexpected as it may be.</p><p>Mr. Warner accumulated his wealth with an early investment in the cellular service provider Nextel, which was sold to Sprint in 2005 for $35 billion. Mr. Warner then became a start-up investor at Columbia Capital, which had an office in Alexandria, Va. He used his fortune to run for governor of Virginia, talking on the campaign trail about bringing work force training and tech-oriented economic development to rural parts of the state. After serving a term, he was elected to the Senate in 2008.</p><p>And even with his recent criticism of the industry, he regularly taps a broad network of tech executives and investors for counsel.</p><p>During the summer, Steve Case, the founder of AOL, stayed at Mr. Warner\u2019s vacation home on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. For years, the two have met regularly to talk about techology-related policy issues, like how artificial intelligence could alter the future of labor.</p><p>But during this year\u2019s trip, they discussed the Senate intelligence committee\u2019s Russia investigation and the power of social media platforms and their role in the election.</p><p>\u201cHis thinking has evolved,\u201d Mr. Case said. \u201cEven though I\u2019m sure this has some benefit with his profile, all things being equal, I think he has approached this with some reluctance because he\u2019d rather be focused on issues like the future of work.\u201d</p><p>And Mr. Warner sees no contradiction in his evolution to being considered a sharp prod of Silicon Valley.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m pro-tech. I\u2019m pro-innovation,\u201d he said, standing and shuffling side to side like a basketball player on defense. On the bookshelf near him was a textbook, \u201cScience and Engineering,\u201d and a small business self-help book called \u201cGrow Regardless: Of Your Business\u2019s Size, Your Industry or the Economy ... and Despite the Government!\u201d</p><p>He went on: \u201cWhat I fear is 2018. If you look at Russian intervention in the American elections, in terms of sowing chaos, they had pretty good R.O.I.,\u201d he said, pulling from his past life with the business acronym for return on investment.</p><p>\u201cThere is too much at stake,\u201d he said.</p><p>PHOTOS: Senator Mark Warner at his office in Washington.

He said he doubted whether Twitter grasped the gravity of the the investigation into Russian election meddling, and fumed to reporters that the company's presentation to congressional investigators about how Russia used Twitter's platform to influence the 2016 race was \"frankly, inadequate on every level\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The public scolding was yet another sign of Washington's growing impatience at Silicon Valley, with the Virginia senator emerging as one of Congress' loudest critics. This month he co-authored new legislation that would require internet companies to disclose who purchased online political ads on their platforms, the most aggressive attempt yet to regulate big tech.</p><p> Related:  Tech giants face Congress as showdown over Russia election meddling looms</p><p>\"Part of the reason these guys have gotten away with no regulation for 20 years is because they convinced Washington that the industry is too complicated',\" said Jonathan Taplin, author of Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.</p><p>\"But it is very hard to say that to Mark Warner. He's been in the technology business. He's been an investor. He can't be smoked.\"</p><p>                     As the political sands shift for technology companies, and executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are set to testify before congressional panels on Capitol Hill this week, there are perhaps few US senators who understand the industry as deeply as Warner, a former entrepreneur and executive who amassed a fortune investing in technology and telecommunications.</p><p>Friends and former colleagues insist Warner is as pro-business and pro-growth as he ever was, still closer on the ideological spectrum to Susan Collins than Bernie Sanders. He maintains a coterie of friends and confidants in Virginia's tech world whom he regularly communicates with and is on friendly terms with a number of Silicon Valley executives.</p><p>But, as vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee investigating Russian interference in the US election and studying how to prevent it from happening again in the 2018 congressional midterms, Warner has developed a more aggressive posture toward big tech. </p><p>He's been in the technology business. He's been an investor. He can't be smoked</p><p>  Jonathan Taplin, author    </p><p>\"Mark does not suffer fools gladly,\" said Bobbie Kilberg, the president and CEO of the Northern Virginia Technology Council. \"By this I mean that when you meet with him, you better know what you're talking about.\"</p><p>However, she said, \"when he is in a role of scrutinizing it he comes from it with a level of sophistication and respect. They know he will be fair.\"</p><p>Warner was the co-founder of a company that became Nextel, the wireless service operator that merged with Sprint Corp in 2005 in a $35bn deal. </p><p>Warner has said publicly and privately that the investigation is \"probably the most important thing I've done\" and his friends say it has renewed his zeal for the institution he serves. </p><p>\"I think it goes without saying his first few years were frustrating,\" said Saxby Chambliss, a retired Republican senator from Georgia. </p><p>Before arriving in the Senate in 2008, Warner was the popular governor of Virginia, leaving office in 2006 with high public approval ratings. He enjoyed the executive role and championed bipartisanship during his tenure, even convincing a Republican legislature to reform the tax code. But when he reached the Senate, Warner felt stonewalled by the slow pace of progress and entrenched partisanship. </p><p>\"When he made a decision as governor something happened. He quickly found that he didn't have the same opportunity in the Senate,\" Chambliss said. \"He's very appreciative of the fact that he's the vice-chair of the [Senate] intelligence committee.\" </p><p>On Wednesday, executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter will go before his committee, where lawmakers say the tone of the meeting will depend on how forthcoming the companies are prepared to be about how Russia used their platforms to spread misinformation and sow discord during the election. </p><p>\"If they see this as a public relations problem that they can paper over then you'll see some frustration from the Senate,\" said Angus King, an independent senator from Maine and a member of the committee.</p><p>\"This was an attack on this country. I would think that they as well as we would want to understand how that happened.\"</p><p>Ahead of the hearings, Facebook and Twitter have introduced internal efforts to increase transparency around the way the accept and display political advertisements. And earlier this month, Facebook dispatched Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer, to Washington as the company faced intensifying criticism from lawmakers and the public. </p><p> Related:  Russia inquiry charges: how close does this get to Trump?</p><p>\"Talk is cheap,\" Warner said, after the Twitter briefing. \"What I'd like to see is a real effort to try to work with us in a way that we can make sure Americans understand the nature and the extent of the threat.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, Warner and co-author Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat of Minnesota, unveiled legislation that would force Google, Facebook and other digital platforms to disclose who purchased online political advertisement. </p><p>But opposition is already whirring to life.

                 Mark Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \"meaningfully hurt\" Facebook before its acquisition of the photo-sharing app, a showdown in Congress has heard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bosses of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google all fended off accusations that their companies stifle competition, under intense questioning before US lawmakers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook boss Mr Zuckerberg faced renewed focus on its gobbling up of competitors by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat head the House Judiciary Committee, said documents obtained from the company \"tell a very disturbing story\" of Facebook's acquisition of the Instagram.</p><p>He said the documents show Mr Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \"meaningfully hurt\" Facebook.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \"complement\" to Facebook's services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing.</p><p>Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsApp messaging service.</p><p>Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Mr Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple answered questions about their business practices.</p><p>They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on US democracy and their role in China.</p><p>The scrutiny of Big Tech could lead to new restrictions on its power, though forced breakups appear unlikely.</p><p>                     The four CEOs were testifying remotely at a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, while most politicians sat, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.</p><p>Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.</p><p>Mr Bezos said that he could not guarantee that Amazon had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.</p><p>Regulators in the US and Europe have scrutinised Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\" Mr Bezos said in a response to a question from Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \"But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\"</p><p>Mr Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to \"mom-and-pop businesses\" in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>But the Google executive struggled as Mr Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Mr Pichai repeatedly deflected Mr Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them from defecting to a rival service such as Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China.</p><p>\"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p><p>In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" President Trump tweeted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Zuckerberg and Facebook have recently been under fire for running ads with misinformation, and breaking up Facebook has been a topic of debate among democratic candidates. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[4]. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan have been advising South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg's[5] presidential campaign on potential hires, Tyler Pager and Kurt Wagner at Bloomberg reported Monday[6]. According to Bloomberg, Zuckerberg and Chan first reached out to the Buttigieg campaign in April, not long after he entered the race. Zuckerberg and Chan both individually sent names to Buttigieg's campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl. </p><p>So far, two of the recommended staffers have been hired. Although Zuckerberg initiated contact, a spokesperson for the Chan-Zuckerbergs told Bloomberg that the campaign asked for hiring recommendations. Representatives for Zuckerberg and Buttigieg did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. The spokesperson told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg has not chosen who to support for president, but many democratic candidates have been critical of Facebook so far in the race. Sen. Elizabeth Warren[7] has made breaking up big tech companies, including Facebook, a cornerstone of her campaign, which has forced other candidates to address their stances[8] on the issue. While Buttigieg has noted that he's worried about privacy and data ownership, he does not plan to break up[9] tech companies.Warren and Facebook have even had a back-and-forth debate on Twitter. Warren is one of several candidates who criticized the platform's policy of running political ads with misinformation. In an unusual move, Facebook directly called out Warren on Twitter, to which Warren responded \"You're making my point here[10]. It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies.\" Read more: A Republican senator just gave Libra its first voice of support in Congress after its rocky start with regulators and partners[11] Zuckerberg has not donated to any 2020 candidates yet, although he did give $5,000 to Facebook's PAC in June, which supports candidates from both major parties, Bloomberg reported. The CEO has also been under fire for hosting off-the-record private dinners[12] with conservative politicians and journalists, saying \"hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning.\" However, Zuckerberg has not been popular with some conservatives, who accuse him of censoring conservative voices on Facebook. All of these incidents have made this a rough year for Zuckerberg. He is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee[13] on October 23 about Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency and advertising policies.NOW WATCH: Here's why phone companies like

Google's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg may be willing to testify in front of Congress as part of its antitrust inquiry into big tech companies, according to reports from both Bloomberg[5] and the Washington Post[6].Both Google and Facebook have already alerted Congress via letter that Pichai and Zuckerberg, respectively, are willing to appear, according to both reports.Neither company immediately responded to Business Insider's request for comment.The companies' willingness to make their top executives available follows Amazon's letter to the House Judiciary Committee[7],which said the company would \"make the appropriate executive available to testify,\" which includes Bezos. </p><p>The letter specifically noted that Bezos would be willing to testify at a hearing \"with the other CEOs this summer.\"Pichai's and Zuckerberg's appearances in front of the panel would be on the condition that the other CEOs appear as well. Apple has not said definitively it will make CEO Tim Cook available to appear before Congress, according to both reports.While Bezos has never testified in front of Congress, Zuckerberg, Pichai, and Cook have all appeared before Congress in the past, although not to specifically address antitrust concerns.The House Judiciary Committee has been looking into tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook for several months, probingwhether any of tech's major players acted anti-competitively[8] and hoping to determine whether laws regarding competition have kept up with the pace of big tech companies.Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, chairs the House's antitrust panel and plans to publish a report on his findings. That report could contain his recommendations for changes to regulations that would directly affect those four companies, according to the Post.

Zuckerberg did not specify how Facebook was used to \"divide\" in his message. </p><p>The 2-billion member social network, created 13 years ago by Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm room, has\u00a0become one of the world's most powerful communication channels. Facebook has been in the spotlight since the 2016 US presidential elections[1] as the spread of fake news articles and political ads[2]\u00a0bought by Russia-linked groups[3] are believed to have used Facebook to gain momentum. Facebook was also criticized for lax oversight over its online advertising categories following a ProPublica report\u00a0which revealed that Facebook's algorithm enabled advertisers to\u00a0serve ads to almost 2,300 \"Jew haters.\"[4]\u00a0 Here is Zuckerberg's full message: NOW WATCH: Here are all the major changes coming to your iPhone September 19[5]See Also: Mark Zuckerberg wanted Facebook

He once predicted that enlightened governments, prodded by a populace empowered by his company's social networking tools, would champion a connected future in which Facebook would play a central part.</p><p>'We believe that leaders will emerge across all countries who are pro-internet and fight for the rights of their people,' he declared in 2012, at the time of Facebook's initial public offering. These would include 'the right to share what they want and the right to access all information that people want to share with them'.</p><p>It was just the kind of self-referential fantasy a 27-year-old planning a $100bn IPO would indulge in. This week, a more mature Mr Zuckerberg now 33, married with two children and fresh from a 30-state 'listening tour' of the US faced off against 98 elected representatives of the American people in Washington DC. They were not the Facebook-friendly army he had dreamt of. Rather than standing up for the right to share, they seemed animated more by fear: that his creation might have become a threat to the privacy of its 2.1bn users and, perhaps, to democracy itself.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg has run headlong into a series of crises caused by the almost unimaginable success of his invention. It began with his resistance to owning up to the fake news epidemic that hit the social network during the 2016 US election, followed by his unwillingness to face up to Facebook's role in Russian interference. That has now been followed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal another crisis that he was too slow to address. It has raised fundamental questions about whether Facebook can be trusted with its users' data.</p><p>To draw the political sting, a pale and studiously deferential Mr Zuckerberg, in sober suit and tie, bowed to 10 hours of public questioning by legislators on Capitol Hill. But his appearance before Congress failed to resolve the question of whether he had done enough to hit reset not just for his company, but for the trajectory of his own life.</p><p>The huge wealth generated by Facebook's success has led to suspicions that Mr Zuckerberg's idealism has been drowned in self-interest. In reality, the Harvard dropout has never separated the two. While declaring his mission to 'make the world more connected', he made clear from the outset that profits would play an important part: as both the validation of his company's success in achieving its higher purpose, and the fuel to further his vision.</p><p>The twin goals of improving the world and making as much money as possible created 'an intrinsic contradiction' from the beginning, says David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect. 'The money has been so prolific that it has truly confused everyone [at Facebook] as to their responsibilities.'</p><p>If Mr Zuckerberg himself has been part of the problem, that has inevitably raised questions about his future. One investor has already called on him to hand over his chairmanship, and there have even been calls for him to surrender management control entirely. Few are holding their breath.</p><p>Given his majority voting control, 'this is an individual who can't be removed from office,' says Scott Galloway, author of a book critical of big tech companies and an outspoken critic of Facebook. But even if shareholders could replace Mr Zuckerberg, it would be beside the point, he adds.</p><p>The Facebook co-founder is doing what all bosses do in maximising his company's profits. The real challenge is for society to come up with restraints. 'It's not his responsibility, it's ours,' says Mr Galloway. The huge wealth generated by Facebook's success has led to suspicions that Zuckerberg's idealism has been drowned in self-interest To his critics, Mr Zuckerberg's outsized success has left him along with his number two, Sheryl Sandberg disconnected from the impact they are having on the world, and badly placed to fix the company.</p><p>'I look at Zuck and Sheryl and think, 'Wow, you've succeeded beyond your wildest dreams, you're billionaires,'' says Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley investor who advised Mr Zuckerberg in Facebook's early days. 'I would think they would want to be heroes in their own movie, instead of presiding over a system that is undermining democracy and civil liberties. But, for whatever reason, something's happened. Maybe they've lost the ability to relate to the problems.'</p><p>To his supporters, this is just one more challenge for an executive who has successfully rebooted Facebook each time it has faced a new threat. 'I have seen Mark face adversity many times, and he has always been able to galvanise his team, and come out stronger as a leader and organisation,' says Jim Breyer, a venture capitalist who backed him when he was 20. 'I would never bet against Mark Zuckerberg.'</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg's attempt to project humility this week has met with mixed success. Not known for his empathy or emotional displays, his apologies for data leaks were late, and sounded pro-forma. A repeated vagueness fed suspicions that despite his claim to be willing to accept new regulations, he has not yielded ground on any important issues.</p><p>But some who have followed him for years say it would be wrong to see the Washington visit as nothing more than a cynical exercise in self-preservation. 'He is now, in a way he definitely wasn't a year and a half ago, trying to work out what it means to be a company with such a civic responsibility,' says Mr Kirkpatrick. Given the stakes, politicians and citizens in many countries will be desperately hoping he is right.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWSNTL-TNEWSINT1604201800004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSNTL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S42-0SS1-F00C-62FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423892</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The News International All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News International</publicationName><volume>Vol. 28</volume><issueNumber>No. 33</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 16, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Pakistan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

'The impulse is to pull back from free expression,' Zuckerberg claimed. 'We are at a crossroads. We can either stand for free expression or we can decide the cost is simply too great. We must continue to stand for free expression.' 'I don't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 percent true,' the Facebook CEO continued. In an attempt to lead the national conversation away from state tech regulation, Zuckerberg pointed out, 'If another nation's platforms set the rules, our nation's discourse could be set by a completely different set of values.' 'We should be proactive and write policies that help free expression triumph around the world,' he said, adding at another point in the speech, 'Increasingly, we're seeing countries try to impose their speech restrictions beyond their country This is incredibly problematic and troubling.' In response to two different audience remarks that Facebook both censors conservatives and shouldn't be performing outreach to conservative leaders, Zuckerberg joked, 'I think it would be hard to be biased against both sides.'

Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) pledge to breakup Big Tech companies if she becomes president, Zuckerberg reportedly noted, 'Of course we'll stand up for ourselves and for what we believe is right.' Have a tip we should know?

Often it is as important that decisions are made in a way that people feel is legitimate. </p><p>I don\u2019t think private companies should make so many decisions alone when they touch on fundamental democratic values. That is why last year I called for regulation in four areas: elections, harmful content, privacy and data portability. </p><p>On Monday Facebook is publishing our <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/02/online-content-regulation/\"> second white paper</url> setting out some questions regulation might address. We\u2019ve also been working with governments \u2014 including in France and New Zealand \u2014 on what regulation could look like. A few themes kept coming up.</p><p>One is transparency. Governments often tell us it\u2019s hard to design content regulation because they don\u2019t have insight into how our systems work. Facebook already publishes more <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/community-standards-enforcement-report-nov-2019/\"> detailed reports</url> about harmful content than       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/11/14/20963124/facebook-transparency-report-limits-justice-oversight-board\"> any other </url>major internet service, and we\u2019ve shown regulators how our systems operate. We\u2019re also looking at opening up our content moderation systems for external audit.</p><p>Then there are political ads. We believe advertising is more transparent on Facebook than television, print or other online services. We publish details about political and issue ads \u2014 including who paid for them, how much was spent, and how many people were reached \u2014 in our <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=GB&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime\"> ads library</url>. </p><p>But who decides what counts as political advertising in a democracy? If a non-profit runs an ad about immigration during an election, is it political? Who should decide \u2014 private companies, or governments? </p><p>Another theme is openness. I\u2019m glad the EU is looking at making <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_102\"> data sharing </url>easier, because it enables people to build things that are valuable for society. International agencies use Facebook\u2019s       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://dataforgood.fb.com/\"> Data for Good</url> programme to figure out which communities need help after natural disasters, and governments use our publicly available population density maps for vaccination campaigns.</p><p>Of course, you should always be able to transfer your data between services. But how do we define what counts as your data? If I share something with you, like my birthday, should you be able to take that data to other services, like your calendar app? Is that my data or yours? </p><p>We have to balance promoting innovation and research against protecting people\u2019s privacy and security. </p><p>Without clear rules on portability, strict privacy laws encourage companies to lock down data, refusing to share with others, to minimise regulatory risks.</p><p>Lastly, we need more oversight and accountability. People need to feel that global technology platforms answer to someone, so regulation should hold companies accountable when they make mistakes. </p><p>Companies like mine also need better oversight when we make decisions, which is why we\u2019re creating an independent Oversight Board so people can appeal Facebook\u2019s content decisions.</p><p>Tech companies should serve society. That includes at the corporate level, so we support the OECD\u2019s efforts to create fair global tax rules for the internet. </p><p>I believe good regulation may hurt Facebook\u2019s business in the near term but it will be better for everyone, including us, over the long term. </p><p>These are problems that need to be fixed and that affect our industry as a whole. If we don\u2019t create standards that people feel are legitimate, they won\u2019t trust institutions or technology.</p><p>Of course, we won\u2019t agree with every proposal. Regulation can have unintended consequences, especially for small businesses that can\u2019t do sophisticated data analysis and marketing on their own. Millions of small businesses rely on companies like ours to do this for them. </p><p>If regulation makes it harder for them to share data and use these tools, that could disproportionately hurt them and inadvertently advantage larger companies that can.</p><p>Still, rather than relying on individual companies to set their own standards, we\u2019d benefit from a more democratic process. This is why we\u2019re pushing for new legislation, and it\u2019s why we support existing US proposals to prevent election interference like the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1989\"> Honest Ads Act</url> and the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2313\"> Deter Act</url>. </p><p>To be clear, this isn\u2019t about passing off responsibility. Facebook is not waiting for regulation; we\u2019re continuing to make progress on these issues ourselves. </p><p>But I believe clearer rules would be better for everyone. The internet is a powerful force for social and economic empowerment. Regulation that protects people and supports innovation can ensure it stays that way.  </p><p>Letter in response to this article:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Remove Zuckerberg and Sandberg from their posts / From George Soros, Paris, France</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-602ec7ec4f1811ea95a043d18ec715f5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y77-XXT1-DXP9-91YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"820\"/><timeReceived>9:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Hala Gorani. Thanks for being with us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, breaking news, just before we came on air, the Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has finally broken his silence five days after a data scandal engulfed his company. Zuckerberg is set to speak with our own Laurie Segall in an interview to be broadcast at 9 p.m. Eastern Time. It will be late in the evening here in Europe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in a post, the Facebook boss pledged to take a series of steps to protect user data and said he is ultimately responsible for whatever happens on the platform. No apology per se, but certainly promising to change things at Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After news, of course, broke this weekend that Cambridge Analytica reportedly accessed information from about 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge. Billions were knocked off Facebook's share price and new investigations have been launched both here in the U.K. and in the United States.</p><p>Let's bring in our business and technology correspondent, Samuel Burke, he's in Miami, and money senior correspondent, Brian Stelter in New York. Brian, let's start with you. We're also hearing from Sherly Sandburg, by the way, a top Facebook executive.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: And she's going a little bit further than Zuckerberg. The COO, Sheryl Sandburg, saying she deeply regrets what has happened here in this lengthy statement from Zuckerberg, he does outline a number of steps he says the company will take.</p><p>Let's (inaudible) through them real quick. He's going to go through and have his engineers look at all of the developers that have access to Facebook back in 2014 when this actual breach happened.</p><p>They are going to look at what these developers were doing with large amounts of Facebook data. Make sure it wasn't misuse and Facebook says it will ban any of those third-party developers that might exploiting Facebook data.</p><p>The company is also going to tighten up its rules on the current use of Facebook data. You know, it's trying to signal to users that you can trust Facebook. That it's not going to misuse your personal information.</p><p>But I would say this is only a first step. If you look at this statement, there are a lot more questions still here. I think it's a good sign he's going to sit down with our colleague, Laurie Segall, and talk more about this.</p><p>But the bottom line here is he is trying to defend Facebook and rationalize Facebook and we'll see how the users react to it.</p><p>GORANI: Yes. I can't wait to see Laurie's interview. It will be very interesting to hear him say this on camera rather than in a Facebook statement. Thanks very much, Brian Stelter.</p><p>Samuel Burke, to you in Miami. I found interesting in the statement that Mark Zuckerberg admits in 2015 we learned from journalists that Alex Coogan who is the professor at Cambridge had shared data from this app with Cambridge Analytica. It is against our policies for developers to share data without people's consent.</p><p>So, we immediately banned Coogan's app from our platform and demanded that Coogan and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that they had deleted all of this improperly acquired data.</p><p>Here's the thing, though, they only asked for a promise. They didn't really check and they learned last week that they had not necessarily deleted the data that Facebook had asked them to erase from their servers.</p><p>So, Zuckerberg is admitting that this was used improperly and that they didn't really didn't check to make sure that this information was erased.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Hala, there is some falling on the sword here, but exactly what you're pointing out, 2015, we're talking about nearly three years ago they knew about this. So, when Brian is laying out there that Zuckerberg is saying we are going to go back and look at all the apps.</p><p>[16:05:02] But they've already been doing this. They already knew about this situation in 2015. So essentially, some of what Zuckerberg is saying is we're going go back and do exactly what we already did.</p><p>If they knew in 2015, which obviously they did. He now admits it in his Facebook statement why didn't they notify users. Why didn't they take more serious steps? So, there are a lot of gaps here as we look at this statement.</p><p>I just want to put up I think what is the key line from this Facebook post from Mark Zuckerberg, he said this, quote, \"We have a responsibility to protect your data and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.\"</p><p>But, clearly, they haven't been able to protect all the data. Just going and saying to this professor and Cambridge Analytica, well, make sure you delete it clearly wasn't enough. And just to add to that, I want to use the words of Sheryl Sandberg saying, \"We know that this was a major violation of people's trust and I deeply regret that we didn't do enough to deal with it.\"</p><p>The stock price for Facebook up a little bit today about 1 percent. Trading is close now. It's going up a little more on this statement. But they are somewhat are saying we're going to do what we already did before.</p><p>GORANI: He's asking quite a lot from users here after this scandal, Samuel, because he ends his statement, Mark Zuckerberg, by saying, \"I want to thank all of you who continue to believe in our mission and work to build this community together. I know it takes longer to fix all these issues than we'd like, but I promise you we'll work through this and build a better service over the long term.\"</p><p>He's asking for people to be patient and to trust Facebook. Even though trust may be broken right now.</p><p>BURKE: We will do better, and boy, do we hear that over and over again from these tech companies, from Facebook. We have seen so many situations this year and last year where the bottom line was we'll do better, and we have to keep on waiting whether it's dealing with terrorist videos, whether it's dealing with foreign entities using the Facebook platform.</p><p>At the end of the day, the real question here for investors and maybe the larger question is will people delete this app as the hashtag is going on Twitter, delete Facebook. Will they use it less because the trust has been broken.</p><p>And I want to just emphasize, I mean, that I think is the most important here. Facebook makes most of its money by selling ads. They don't give your information to those advertisers as best we know, and I don't think they do.</p><p>We've never heard that from advertisers, but they gave our information to somebody who is doing a Facebook personality quiz. Why risk all of that data with our data, their stock price for something that really doesn't make them that much money. Really an unforced error if you think about it.</p><p>GORANI: But there's another question here that for me just absolutely jumps out after reading this statement. Mark Zuckerberg admits that Facebook knew in 2015 this app was harvesting data from unsuspecting users. They asked Cambridge Analytica to delete all the data. They now know they didn't delete it.</p><p>They suspended Cambridge Analytica from their platform only after learning from journalists that the company hadn't deleted the data. Why not suspend Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when you knew what they've done?</p><p>BURKE: Exactly. They didn't really just learn this from journalists recently. They knew about this back in 2015 and didn't suspend Cambridge Analytica then. Also, some of the other steps that they are talking about taking, Hala, one that really jumped out to me was this third step that they were laying out.</p><p>They are going to have a new tool that they will have on the platform right at the top of the feed they say so that you can see all the apps. This tool was actually already existed. It just been tucked away for ages.</p><p>You and I have been talking today and I've been showing you how to get to some of this. Why was it tucked away so deep and how come so often when Facebook launches these tools it's only available on desktop.</p><p>They are telling their advertisers we're all about mobile, but when they launch one of these products, it's only on desktop where fewer people can see it. I hope, I suspect this one will be available on mobile as well, so the 2 billion users will have better access to it.</p><p>GORANI: All right. So, we're getting a lot of promises here from Mark Zuckerberg. I'd like you to stay with us as we continue to cover this breaking news, Samuel Burke.</p><p>And I want to go to Mitchell Baker, she's the executive chairwoman of Mozilla. Even as Zuckerberg is breaking his silence, this crisis for Facebook is showing no sign of dying down. Mitchell Baker, thanks for being with us. Mozilla has launched a petition to try to pressure Facebook into making the app more private. What is this petition about?</p><p>MITCHELL BAKER, CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRWOMAN, MOZILLA: This petition is about the idea, it's not the job of each one of us, every citizen out there to figure out what is happening at Facebook or what's happening to our data. It's Facebook's job to do a better job in protecting it.</p><p>And so, we want to make sure that as citizens, good controls are helpful and new tools are helpful, but the defaults in Facebook and the basic approach, Facebook needs to be in charge of, you know, that.</p><p>[16:10:08] And the approach in many cases seems to be externalizing the issues to individual users and it's got to become more systematic from Facebook itself.</p><p>GORANI: And what did you make of the statement? Were you able to hear our coverage of the statement that was just posted on Facebook by Mark Zuckerberg? He's saying we have a responsibility to protect your data or we don't deserve to serve you is how he starts things out and then promises to take a series of steps to restrict app access to user's data. What did you make of that?</p><p>BAKER: I think it's a start. It's a start in a positive direction. There's still some systematic issues. One is the fundamental issue of the nature of data itself and how is it collected, where it is collected, is there any way that an individual can really opt-out of it. Another is transparency.</p><p>It's very hard to know what's going on. So. I'm very glad to see Mark's promises, but I would also feel better if we actually understood what was happening and it was a little more transparent. And we saw over time that the data is the core of their business, but it's our lives and so the sense of, you know, the asset that they are dealing with deepens.</p><p>GORANI: But I mean, is there any other way to make sure that people don't use your data or companies I should say, don't use your data and essentially deleting the app? There have been calls even from the co- founder of WhatsApp, who became very rich for selling his company to Facebook saying, look, just delete Facebook. Do you agree with that?</p><p>BAKER: Well, that certainly helps but, of course, if your friends and family are using Facebook and posting information about you on it, there will still be plenty of information on you. Also depending on what identities you set up to log in with, you would want to delete the app but also find some other ways so you're not signing in with Facebook.</p><p>And then there's, of course, all the world around you. So, if one wanted to delete the app, you know, some big chunk of your personal data wouldn't show up there. But there is still a lot of information about you flowing around.</p><p>That's why I say it needs to be a systematic approach. It is important for each one of us who cares to do what we can because that's the demonstrate of interest, but it is not realistic to think that each one of us can protect ourselves if the core system doesn't do that as well.</p><p>GORANI: But you complain and you believe that there should be an opt-in to share your data but when I went to your privacy notice, Firefox privacy notice, it says learn how to opt out of data collection. So, all tech companies do this, right?</p><p>BAKER: Wes. Well, not all. People do different things in different settings. So sometimes you would look at what kind of data are you actually sharing. And, yes, this question of what is opt-in and what is opt-out is going across the industry --</p><p>GORANI: How will it change you, your company, I mean, your foundation -- obviously, Mozilla is a wider not for profit but the browser, I mean, the household name is the Firefox browser.</p><p>BAKER: Yes, it is. We collect very little data and we don't -- the little bit that we have we don't allow others to use it. We view ourselves as your agent. If you have Firefox on your phone or desktop, we view that as you, as your and representing you so we try to make Firefox do what we think you would want on your behalf.</p><p>GORANI: We're putting up, by the way, this petition, tell Facebook this can't happen again. What's the ultimate aim here, to put pressure on Facebook?</p><p>BAKER: There's a few, that would be one. Another one is many times as consumers when we look at the world around us, what could I do? You know, I don't like that, but what can one single human being do? So to explore and find ways where a single human beings actually can make an impact.</p><p>GORANI: Yes. I do wonder, we're at the very, very beginning of a fundamentally new era for the human race where we're all so utterly interconnected online where privacy has become -- taken on an entirely new meaning because we have so much of our information floating around not just on Facebook, but what we give corporations, our loyalty cards when we sign up for a mortgage. It's all out there. How do you even begin to control that now?</p><p>BAKER: Well, I think, first of all, sort of understanding what's happening and understanding the power of that data. Because the other part of the Cambridge Analytica story is the use to which they chose to put that data, and that's the belief that they could encourage/manipulate citizens to do - - to vote in a certain way.</p><p>[16:15:07] So that's also under debate how effective was it. But even Facebook has done studies that people -- you can change our mood and outlook very easily. So, I think to change it first as an understanding, second is tools and opportunities that help people and the third is that the big platforms do need to take more responsibility.</p><p>And I think as we come to understand how powerful that data is, I think the public will, will jump, because in the early phases it is such a luxury to get all these things online for free.</p><p>GORANI: It's not really free, though, I think we're realizing that now.</p><p>BAKER: Right. It is free of charge from your pocketbook, but there's a cost to it and I think as we learn that cost is also I am manipulatable. If you have enough information about me, you can both predict what I'm going to do before I know it and you can influence what I do. I think as that sinks in then the will and demand will get much deeper.</p><p>GORANI: Do you have a Facebook page?</p><p>BAKER: I do. I don't actually use it much, but I have one.</p><p>GORANI: All right. So, I presume you've gone into the privacy settings and done all you can to keep your information secure. But if Facebook doesn't make these change that you would like it to make or quickly enough, then would you consider doing the whole deleting Facebook and just, you know, telling other people they should too or what?</p><p>BAKER: I certainly would or will consider it, really currently the information is, there's not much that I post there, I stopped doing that quite some time ago. Certainly, I would. We at Mozilla are also, you know, pausing our advertising with Facebook as well until we understand what's happened and what's going to happen next.</p><p>GORANI: When did you make the decision to suspend adverting on Facebook platform?</p><p>BAKER: Earlier this week.</p><p>GORANI: And were you -- was that just a platform where you regularly advertise?</p><p>BAKER: We do a bit. We're not a big advertiser and so we're not a big customer of Facebook, but we do because we have consumer products and we felt, you know, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, we just didn't understand what was happening and it's extremely disturbing. So, Mark and Cheryl are making statements now. We'll see what comes out of that, but earlier in the week that wasn't the case and we felt like we should really understand what's going on before we continue to engage.</p><p>GORANI: Thanks so much for your time from San Francisco. Mitchell Baker, the executive chairwoman of Mozilla. Samuel Burke is still with me. He's in Miami. So, we just -- and Samuel, as you know, we got this Facebook statement just seconds before going on the air so I highlighted the sections that I thought were important.</p><p>And we already discussed that Mark Zuckerberg has admitted the company has a responsibility to protect the data of its users and then he is promising a series of steps. First, we will investigate all apps. Second, we will restrict developers access to your data, and then obviously third, we want to make sure you understand what apps are doing with your data.</p><p>So that's one, two and three. Let's talk a little bit about first one, investigating all apps because if they knew two years ago that Cambridge Analytica had misused this data, why didn't they investigate all the apps then?</p><p>BURKE: This could make some investors very nervous because think about, we've only been talking about just one app that we know had information that was taken and given to Cambridge Analytica. Now that's a very sexy headline, a very great way to get into this story.</p><p>But imagine all the other apps they are using that aren't associated with the Donald Trump campaign and what they've been doing with this information. We're talking about, I assume, thousands if not tens of thousands of apps.</p><p>But, again, the investigation they carried out before clearly didn't do all that much even by their own admission so one wonders what the investigation is going to be like now and I don't know if your team has had time to bring tweet from Damien Collins. He's an MP for the digital --</p><p>I think this is incredibly important, Hala, because it gets to what you're talking about. This is an MP in the U.K. parliament who has been trying to get information about the possible role Russia might have had in influencing people on social media around the Brexit vote.</p><p>Damien Collins is obviously seeing the news that's happening right now and responding this way. Mark Zuckerberg hasn't addressed why Facebook didn't deal with concerns about the exposure of Facebook user data at the time and the risks now.</p><p>Getting to your question there, and this is an MP, who has been trying to work with Facebook now and Twitter for about a year and has had such hard time getting an answer from these social media companies.</p><p>[16:20:13] They say we are going to be transparent. We're going to do our best. Then we watched it back and forth, and it's amazing to see sometimes on one statement the social media companies say we'll work with them. They don't answer the questions.</p><p>Both Facebook and Twitter over and over and over again I've been watching this MP all year as he tries to get some answers to some very simple questions quite frankly.</p><p>GORANI: All right. We'll ask -- we have more guests throughout the show who are going to be talking about this breaking news. One question I have, and we'll discuss this later, is should there be a paying platform where you pay money, you don't get targeted by any advertisers and that's part of the contract. I know there are parts of the world where that wouldn't work. Would you want that service, that option?</p><p>BURKE: -- Netflix style. I think the problem is that it is just so amazing you look at the revenue and reach of Facebook that a lot of advertisers want that so desperately that they might even be willing to pay higher premiums. We've seen in the past year how so many digital platforms had to lay off people because the grip of Facebook over the market.</p><p>Facebook and Google, two companies alone control 50 percent of the digital ad space. It's rare to see just two companies control 50 percent of a Market.</p><p>GORANI: Because in the traditional economy when you have that much of a monopoly over the last decade governments usually intervene and believe that there's an antitrust issue. In this particular case, we're at the very beginning of this era of the big tech companies controlling so much of the market. We'll see if things change there. I have to move on. I could talk about this for the next two hours nonstop.</p><p>Samuel, we'll speak to you a little bit later. As we mentioned, Mark Zuckerberg will be sitting down for an exclusive interview on \"AC360\" in a few hours. Laurie Segall has secured that interview. That's at 1:00 a.m. in London, 9:00 a.m. in Hongkong only on CNN. Tune in for that and we will be back with much more.</p><p>GORANI: The U.S. president is said to be furious over a major leak that revealed he either missed or simply ignored wordings from his national security team. According to the \"Washington Post,\" Donald Trump congratulated Vladimir Putin on his election victory despite being advised not to congratulate him.</p><p>In fact, his briefing materials reportedly read in all caps, do not congratulate. Chief of Staff John Kelly is also infuriated over the breach. Officials inside the White House are saying a leak of this nature is a firable offense.</p><p>Meanwhile, new legal troubles for the president involving a porn star, a \"Playboy\" model, and a former reality show contestant.</p><p>[16:25:06] Three women are now fighting to tell their stories of alleged sexual affairs and harassment with the current president of the United States.</p><p>Let's bring in our team, White House reporter, Stephen Collinson is in Washington, M.J. Lee joins us from New York. Stephen, I'll start with the leaks. We've just gotten reaction from the president on Twitter as usual about his phone call with Vladimir Putin. Tell us about that.</p><p>STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Right. The president really defending himself over the fact that he didn't raise these issues with Vladimir Putin, the issues of Russia's meddling in the U.S. election and the attack using a nerve agent on the soil of America's closest NATO ally the United Kingdom.</p><p>He basically said that he needs have a good relationship with President Vlimir Putin because Russia can help the U.S. on issues like ISIS, North Korea, and Syria. He accuses President George W. Bush, who tried to have a good relationship with Putin of not being smart enough to pull it off.</p><p>And he said Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, and President Barack Obama didn't have the energy or chemistry to do so. What this ignores, of course, is the fact that many people in the United States foreign policy establishment believed that President Trump is being, is having the wool pulled over his eyes really on a host of foreign policy issues by President Putin and question this relationship he has with the Russian president.</p><p>GORANI: But Stephen, not that many people had access to this briefing that advised the president not to congratulate Vladimir Putin on his re- election. It shouldn't be that difficult then to figure out who is leaking this information, right?</p><p>COLLINSON: It shouldn't be and there's an investigation going on in the White House, and I think you can understand actually why the president is so furious about this. This is, if it's not classified information, it's highly sensitive information and yet say six hours after he spoke to Putin it's on the website of \"The Washington Post.\"</p><p>I think that tells you a lot about the discord within the president's foreign policy team and the anger there is in the foreign policy establishment that he did go ahead and congratulate Putin who is somebody who is accused of assaulting American democracy. I think that's what it gets down to.</p><p>But clearly, it's a sign of, you know, a great disagreement between the president and much of his foreign policy team on the correct approach to Russia.</p><p>GORANI: M.J. Lee, we talked porn stars for a few days, now we get to talk about \"Playboy\" models and reality show contestants, three women wanting to tell their story of their alleged affairs with Trump.</p><p>M.J. LEE, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: Yes. And let's first talk a Stormy Daniels, the porn star actually, because there's some big news and that's that we now have a copy of a polygraph test that she took back in 2011 talking about her alleged affair with Donald Trump.</p><p>She was specifically asked questions about whether she had sexual intercourse with Donald Trump and whether she had unprotected sex with Donald Trump and she answered yes to both and what we now know is that at the time the person who administered this test said that he had no reason to believe that she was not being truthful.</p><p>So, all of this, of course, casting doubt on the White House's insistence and President Trump's insistence that he never had this affair with Stormy Daniels to begin with. As you said there are a number of other headlines as well about other women other than Stormy Daniels.</p><p>The first one is Karen McDougal. She is a former \"Playboy\" model who says that she had a 10-month affair with Donald Trump and now she has decided to sue American Media, Inc. This is the company that owns the \"National Inquirer.\"</p><p>And what she is alleging is that she was paid $150,000 at that time for her story, but that the publication ultimately decided not to publish her story. Now she would like the freedom to speak and so this lawsuit is basically to allow her, she hopes, to speak out about her affair with Donald Trump.</p><p>And finally, and I'll be quick, I know that there's a lot to get through, Summer Zervos is the former star of \"The Apprentice,\" a reality tv show that made Donald Trump so famous and she is someone who is actually accusing President Trump of past sexual assault.</p><p>So, obviously, a very serious issue and serious accusations here and she filed a defamation suit against President Trump and Trump's lawyers tried to have the case either dismissed or at least get a continuance and what a New York judge ordered yesterday is basically they denied both of these requests and said the lawsuit will continue. So, a lot here of ongoing headaches for the president involving at least three women and I think the question that's on everyone's minds constantly is, will there be other stories, will there be other women who come forward with their stories?</p><p>HALA GORANI, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: All right. MJ Lee, thanks very much. I have a feeling we'll be talking porn stars and Playboy models for the foreseeable future. We appreciate your reporting.</p><p>Coming up, as Mark Zuckerberg breaks his silence on the Cambridge Analytica scandal. We have a lot more on our breaking news coming up. Stay with CNN.</p><p>GORANI: Back to our top story. Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg has finally spoken out on the data scandal that's engulfed his company. Zuckerberg is due to speak to CNN's Lori Siegel in an interview broadcast on \"ANDERSON COOPER'S 360\" at 9:00 Eastern Time. It'll be 1:00 a.m. here in London.</p><p>In a post on Facebook, obviously, he has pledged to take a serious of steps to protect the data of its users. But investors are now suing the social media giant and some people are saying it's time to delete the platform all together.</p><p>Let's get more from Dylan Byers. He is live in Los Angeles. So before -- it was quite a long statement on Facebook. And we also heard from the COO Sheryl Sandberg, who was expressing a little bit more regret and apologizing a little bit more than Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>But one of the things he says is that in 2015, the company learned that this app was misusing user data that a professor at Cambridge developed and that Cambridge Analytica ultimately harvested and used this harvested data, but it only took them two years to suspend Cambridge Analytica from their website and acknowledge publicly that they knew that this was going on.</p><p>DYLAN BYERS, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: Right. And the question here, if you look at the statement from Mark Zuckerberg and certainly Sheryl Sandberg, as well, a lot of thought has been put in to how best to address this problem. There's no question looking at all the specific tweaks that Facebook has come up with to try and fix this issue all the way towards running audits for anyone who has their data to make sure that they're not violating Facebook policy. There is clearly a well intention effort here to try and fix this problem.</p><p>But there's some problems for Facebook. One, is it too little too late? Two, how do users trust Facebook given that they didn't -- like you said, they didn't address this problem until now, until there were reports in the media that effectively forced Facebook's hand.</p><p>And then three, and this is for me, the really big issue with Facebook here. Facebook is in the data harvesting business. This is what they do. The reason Facebook is such a powerful and wealthy company is because they are able to collect user data, sell user data to third parties and no matter what restrictions you put on that, and no matter how hard you try to police what those parties do with user data, you're never going able to completely prevent abuses of that data, you're never going to able to prevent third parties from handing that data over to other people completely.</p><p>And so the question right now is with all of this pressure on Facebook, public pressure, regulatory pressure, perhaps both here and where you are in London. Is it enough? Is there enough of an apology here and enough of a reassurance that Facebook actually cares about user data? I'm not sure that's the case.</p><p>[16:35:25] GORANI: Right. And so Mark Zuckerberg in the statement is promising to put in motion several steps in order to protect user data, that they will investigate apps that have access to large amounts of information, that they will restrict developers data, access even further, they're saying. And also thirdly that they want to make sure that users understand what apps are doing with their data which I tried to go into my privacy settings today. Honestly, I couldn't figure out a few things. I have to Google the steps I needed to take. And then Mark Zuckerberg ends by saying trust me, essentially. This is going to take a long time but our relationship we'll get through this together.</p><p>BYERS: Right.</p><p>GORANI: I wonder if that's going to convince users who were skeptical today.</p><p>BYERS: No. Look, after the wave of issues that Facebook has had with trust, Mark Zuckerberg is really the last person, I think who can make a convincing case that you should trust Facebook. You know, again, this scandal is coming on the heels of what we've already seen with Russian manipulation of the Facebook platform, and political ads during the 2016 campaign, and really what it throws into the spotlight again is the fact that Facebook does it. They monitor you as you travel around the internet. Even when you are not on Facebook or Facebook on platforms like Instagram, like WhatsApp. You are actually being monitored by Facebook very often and they are using that data to turn a profit for their own company.</p><p>And so when Mark Zuckerberg comes to the American people and says \"trust me\" after not telling them about Cambridge Analytica for years, after not - - after having a lot of time so sort of address this problem and not doing so, it's really going to be hard for the American people and I think potentially all over the world to trust.</p><p>GORANI: Sorry, Dylan. I was doing -- Facebook is used a lot outside of United States. Sometimes it is really the only app that people know. It's how they know the internet, it's through Facebook. In developing countries and in parts of the world where it's much more expensive to communicate in different ways.</p><p>But Dylan, thanks very much. And we'll stay in close touch as this news continues to break.</p><p>Our next guest says that for many, as we were just discussing now, Facebook is important because it's what allows families to stay in touch. It's a social community when families are spread out and scattered and splintered all over the world.</p><p>Safiya Noble is an assistant professor at the University of Southern California, school of communication and she joins me now. So, Safiya, what do you say to people who say delete Facebook in protest?</p><p>SAFIYA NOBLE, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: Well, I think that's the position of a privileged few, particularly in the United States who could launch a campaign and argue that we could delete Facebook which, of course, we can and many people will and probably should. But that doesn't negate the fact that Facebook has two billion users worldwide and for some people their only experience of the internet is Facebook. And so I think it's a little bit disingenuous to think that we can solve these problems strictly at an individual or personal level. Certainly we need to pay attention to many multi-national media tech companies that are tracking us.</p><p>GORANI: But what about other forms of communication? I mean in developing countries the use of mobile phones is widespread, access to 3G usually is available, more or less, even in areas that are far removed. Is it possible that people even here, even in more disadvantage parts of the world who use Facebook to stay in touch with family might be turned off?</p><p>NOBLE: Well, I think that one of the challenges here is that we have so much interconnectivity between these platforms whether you're using a mobile device to connect to Facebook. There are certain kind of interrelated applications, people are logging into all kinds of other systems using their Facebook log in. I don't think it's quite that simple to just move to another platform. All of the major platforms are interested in buying, selling, trading our personal data to advertisers, to state governments, to all kinds of actors. And so I think flocking away from Facebook to another possible platform isn't nearly going to get at the structural issues of what does it mean to become the product of these large companies and have very, very little control over that.</p><p>[16:40:06] GORANI: So what's the solution?</p><p>NOBLE: Well, I think we see an uptick in interest in regulation in the United States, certainly the EU has been out front and in terms of other platforms like Google, Amazon, eBay, I think Facebook, for sure, we're definitely going to need to sit down at the table with people who study these platforms, those of us who understand the harms that can come to the public and we need to be thinking about consumer protections across a whole host of platforms that harvest our data and sell it, particularly because we don't know the ways in which we're being commodified and sold.</p><p>GORANI: But, Safiya, also the issue is that very few companies control a huge majority of how we communicate online, where we buy our products, where we store our personal information. I mean, you know, obviously when you had big industrial corporations cornering markets like that there was then a concerted effort to break that up and introduce antitrust laws and allow smaller competitors to have a fair shake. Here, you're facing a similar issue, right, with a completely different industry?</p><p>NOBLE: That's absolutely true. I just wrote a book about this called \"Algorithms of Oppression\" where I look more closely at Google, but certainly other large monopoly platforms who control the information landscape that so many of us have been, you know, forced or strongly encouraged to engage with. And Facebook is not the only company that's tracking us, and all of these platforms have been left to kind of self- regulate or self-manage and we know that that's not how you protect consumers from tremendous damage that can be inflicted upon them through monopoly hold on information or media.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Safiya Noble, I think we're at the very beginning of this process when it comes to big tech companies. We'll see if this scandal has any measurable impact. Thanks so much for joining us. And as we mentioned, Mark Zuckerberg himself will be sitting down for an exclusive interview on A360 with Lori Siegel at 1:00 a.m., if you're in London. If you're in Hong Kong, you're in luck because it won't be so late. It'll be at 9:00 a.m. And it replay throughout the day, of course.</p><p>The man thought to be behind the sting of package bombings in Austin, Texas is dead. Police say 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt blew himself up as authorities closed in on him early this morning. This footage is said to show him entering a local FedEx store and authorities are confident he is responsible for the five explosions that killed two people and wounded five others in the region. What is not yet clear is whether he acted alone or if he may have left other deadly packages around the area. I should add what's not clear is what his motive might have been.</p><p>Still to come tonight, the U.S. East Coast gets a very chilly start to the spring. More on the massive storm disrupted travel and causing cancelations at the White House.</p><p>[16:45:25] GORANI: In Nigeria, more than 100 school children are now trying to go back to normal life after being released by the terrorist group Boko Haram early on Wednesday.</p><p>Lynda Kinkade has their story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LYNDA KINKADE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR: Crowds gather in a small Nigerian village as they hear the news. Nearly all of the 110 school girls kidnapped in Dapchi Nigeria have been returned. Tears rolling down the girls' faces as they are surrounded by friends and family once more. The students were kidnapped from the government girls science and technological college on February 19th. Several of the girls said some of their friends died in captivity. One of the girls described how they were taken by Babangida, a member of the terror group, Boko Haram.</p><p>KHADIJA GREMA, KIDNAPPED GIRL (through translator): When they took us from the school, we were seated thinking about what we could eat. Then we heard a gunshot. Everybody was confused, running helter-skelter. They then called to us and asked us to come to the school gate. We went to the gate. They then called Babangida to bring a vehicles and they packed us into the car.</p><p>KINKADE: There was no reason given for the girls return. The Nigerian government denies paying a ransom. The read in a statement that back channel efforts led to their release and that it was unconditional. The girls were seen walking into Dapchi after simply being dropped off early Wednesday morning.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I saw with my own eyes, 11 Boko Haram vehicles. They were with the children. When they got to the tarred road, they stopped and blocked the road. They didn't talk to anybody. They didn't greet anybody. They were just shouting \"Allahu Akbar.\" They dropped the children on a corner. Everybody came to see the children.</p><p>KINKADE: The Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari had vowed to bring the girls home deploying troops and surveillance aircrafts to find them. But according to a new amnesty international report, the Nigerian government failed to act on advance warnings of the Boko Haram raid on the school. Nigerian army spokesman, John Agim tell CNN the allegations are false and that the army was not informed.</p><p>The kidnapping of these girls is the biggest mass abduction since Boko Haram took more than 270 school girls in the town of Chibok in 2014. A case that triggered international outrage. Over 100 of those girls remain missing.</p><p>Lynda Kinkade, CNN.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: The British foreign secretary focused some of its comments on Russia when he addressed parliament just a few hours ago always colorful. Boris Johnson said Russia would look to boost its image by hosting the world cup in the same way Adolf Hitler tried to use the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany. And he also commented about the poisoning of a former Russian spy in England.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: I think the timing is probably more closely connected with the recent election in Russia. And as many known democratic figures do when facing an election or facing some critical political moment. It is often -- it is often attractive to conjure up in the public imagination the notion of an enemy.</p><p>More news just in to CNN of the Palestinian girl on trial for slapping and kicking an Israeli soldier has now agreed to a plea deal. Ahed Tamimi will spend eight months in prison including the time already served since December. The Israeli military prosecutors have agreed to drop eight of the 12 charges. Tamimi became famous when she was filmed attacking the soldier outside her house just hours after she found out her cousin had been shot dead with a rubber bullet.</p><p>Let's turn our attention now to the United States and for a story that's not political for a change. A monster snow storm is tearing through the U.S. northeast two days into spring when 70 million people are under winter weather alerts along the east coast. More than 4,000 flights have been cancelled. So check, by the way, with your airline if you're flying to the U.S. And the heavy snow is disrupting work in Washington. The White House cancelled all public events today. And federal government offices were shut down. This is the fourth Nor'easter to hit the U.S. in three weeks.</p><p>And in Washington, Philadelphia and New York it's expected to dump more snow than the three earlier storms combined. Let's check in with Alex Marquardt, he joins us live from New York. I haven't seen -- there is your background. How is it going, Alex?</p><p>[16:50:09] ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Hala. Isn't this a beautiful first day of spring? Actually, it is quite beautiful. But it belies a very serious forecast here. The east coast in the past few weeks has been pummeled by these four nor'easters over the past three weeks. Some of the cities you mentioned major east coast cities, Philadelphia, Washington, New York, where we are, in Boston, all getting this heavy snowfall. We've seen this heavy snow coming down all day. In all different forms. It's been rain, it's been sleet, it's been hail at times. Now, you've got these big fluffy flakes that are coming down and the storm is supposed to get worse over the next few hours. This city, New York City is under a winter storm warning until tomorrow morning at 8:00.</p><p>And if you look over here, this is the highway going down the west side of Manhattan. You can see there are lots of cars. They are actually doing quite well. The city has done a very good job at preparing these roads, preparing these highways to avoid any sort of accidents. But despite what the snow looks like coming down, it's not that fluffy light snow that any skier likes to enjoy. This is actually very heavy and wet snow. The danger right now is that it's not very cold. It's hovering right around zero degree Celsius. So that makes for heavy wet snow that is perfect for plucking snow balls, perfect for making snowman which a lot of people surely are doing today. But what that means despite some of the calm that you're seeing on the streets here, the danger is that it will weigh down these branches, weigh down the trees, those branches could end up on power lines and lead to power outages that will add to the chaos. Up in Massachusetts, there are still people who are still trying to get back online after some of the storms over the course of the past few weeks.</p><p>Now, here in this area, New York as I mentioned is supposed to get some of the worst or heaviest snow fall between 30 and 45 centimeters. There's been a state of emergency declared in the southern part of New York State. Across the Hudson River here in the state of New Jersey, they have also declared a state of emergency. New York City schools are completely out today. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo has asked people to stay inside as much as they can, if they have to go out to use public transportation. He says this is a very serious storm, but one he says they are fully prepared for. Hala.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Alex Marquardt, thanks very much.</p><p>A minor correction. I mentioned Ahed Tamimi and the fact that she had agreed to a plea deal to spend eight months in prison. She's already served three. That means she'll be probably freed around July. I said that she slapped the Israeli soldier after finding out her cousin have been shot dead in the head with a rubber bullet. In fact, the cousin was shot in the head with a rubber bullet, but did not die. We'll be right back with more news on CNN.</p><p>GORANI: Well India is, course, a land of culture. It has traditions that go back many, many centuries from architectural marvels to time-honored crafts and religious celebration. This month on CNN's \"DESTINATION INDIA,\" we delve into the distinctive sights and sounds of the south Asian nation and how it celebrates colorfully the coming of spring.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:55:12] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ganga has been the symbol of our age long culture values. People worship Ganges water. It's very deep-rooted. People come very early before sunrise, before our rituals. They offer water to the rising sun and they are polite to them. It's a matter of faith we respect, we worship. We have blend up cultures here in Varanasi, Buddhist, Muslims, Hindus, Jews. This is a microcosm of Indian Life.</p><p>Holy celebrated across the country from (INAUDIBLE) to Kashmir Today is the day of full moon day. We cook very delicious cuisines and everyone will have new clothes and we make the life colorful. That's why through color on each other.</p><p>Green symbolizes prosperity and red also happiness. We use dye powder. We have issued that this is the victory of good (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>Tonight, we will burn the bonfire (INAUDIBLE). We want to burn our enmity. We want to burn our social label from holy, we have new life. Almost everyone celebrate holy. Armed with this, but we participate, we respect all religions. This is the beauty of this city. Reap, live, and we respect each other.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: Thanks for watching. I'm Hala Gorani.

The social media goliath is the world's primary vector of fake news, hate speech and climate denial.  Now, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcLSU17M3Lw\">in a US speaking tour</url>, Mark Zuckerberg is making it clear that the platform is refusing to do anything about this. It's obviously a huge issue in the US, where the twists and turns of Trumpian melodrama are shaped by fake news. But it's also reflected in Australia's\u00a0own post-truth politics.  The world where politics was shaped by the open contention between truth and falsehood (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica\">as Milton declared</url> some 400 years ago) seems gone. In its place, we have a world where the big tech platforms drown us in information, where objective truth is displaced from the centre of political debate by likes, shares and thumbs-up emojis.  [related-story id=\"670996\"]  Late last month, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications (and former UK Lib Dem Party leader) Nick Clegg announced that Facebook will not apply its usual \"community standards\" to politicians' speech       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/09/elections-and-political-speech/\">on the basis that</url> anything a politician says is \"newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard\". Clegg also confirmed that the company would continue to exempt political advertising from third-party fact-checking.  The Clegg speech fell neatly       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-mark-zuckerberg-hold-surprise-white-house-meeting-n1056721\">after a private meeting</url> between Zuckerberg and Trump -- and just before       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/04/politics/joe-biden-trump-early-state-campaign-ad/index.html\">Trump launched a $10 million</url>\u00a0ad buy on Facebook with false attacks on the Democratic co-front-runner Joe Biden.  It also coincided with reports of Zuckerberg meeting with other US right-wing figures.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892354/mark-zuckerberg-full-transcript-leaked-facebook-meetings\">A leaked transcript</url> showed Zuckerberg attacking Elizabeth Warren's plan to break up Facebook. He was quoted saying: \"if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight\".  These events have come together all at once to mark a seismic moment in how we should understand social media.  It's not just that Facebook (and the other social media platforms) provide an opportunity for spreading soiled or destructive information, or that social media is polluted with bots and trolls; rather, it's that the ad tech and algorithms that drive the revenue for the business, reward this sort of information by design. And it seems that the tech companies are unwilling to sacrifice the money they make by changing them.  Because any existential threat to Facebook can <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">only</emphasis> come from US regulators, most reporting and analysis on these events has focused on what it means in a solely American context. But, its impact is just as great in Australia.  [related-story id=\"664245\"]  Take the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/08/it-felt-like-a-big-tide-how-the-death-tax-lie-infected-australias-election-campaign\">\"death taxes\" lie</url>, which was so influential in the recent federal election. This could not have occurred without the distribution that social media provided -- enabling the targeting of demographics least likely to doubt, and most likely to spread misinformation through shares.  Apparently there's now little shame in falsehoods. There's greater shame in losing than in lying.  The removal of restraints on politicians' speech is being exploited by extreme right-wing politicians, such as Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts, in what is now a vicious circle: elected politicians can spread talking points on Facebook without restraint -- providing an almost irresistible weapon to get themselves re-elected.  Traditional media once played the critical role of holding politicians to account on a standard of honesty, and real-time fact-checking and truth-telling. Thanks to this scrutiny, as recently as 2014, Barry O'Farrell stepped down as NSW premier for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/nsw-premier-barry-ofarrell-step-down-over-wine-cla/2231659/\">a misstatement over a gift.</url>  This kept a self-serving relativism out of day-to-day political debate. Zuckerberg, on the other hand, can now dismiss demands for action by Facebook with a shrug: \"misinformation is a pretty broad category\", he said       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/17/zuckerberg-standing-voice-free-expression/\">in a recent Georgetown speech</url>. Sure, we know that. But journalism spent close to 200 years building ethical codes and professional practices to deal with that very conundrum.  Of course, the work of journalism was often clunky and ineffective -- go back no further to the industry's embarrassment over Iraq and WMDs. It was often profoundly imperfect. But the striving for truth that underpinned the best of the craft provided better guardrails for political debate than the post-truth (non-truth) world that social media seems intent on leading us towards.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB3-6N41-F0NT-H0KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><timeReceived>11:18:09 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I believe it is pro-challenger. I believe that banning political ads ... favors incumbents,\" he said at Georgetown University.</p><p> Mr. Zuckerbeg participated in a forum that was part of the school's speaker series \"Democracy in the Digital Age.\" He spoke for more than 30 minutes before answering a handful of questions submitted by students.</p><p> His remarks focused on his view that Facebook valued \"voice\" and \"inclusion\" in the furtherance of free expression. Without identifying politicans such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, of California, who have called for political opponents to be taken offline, Mr. Zuckerberg railed against the idea underpinning the practice of de-platforming.</p><p> \"Some people believe that giving people a voice is driving division rather than bringing people together,\" he said. \"More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes that they think matter is more important than every person having a voice and being heard. And I think that's dangerous.\"</p><p>Georgetown is the latest stop on Mr. Zuckerberg's charm offensive aimed at skeptical audiences. Since July, Mr. Zuckerberg has privately courted political conservatives, reportedly including Sen. Lindsey Graham, Fox News personality Tucker Carlson and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.</p><p> Many conservatives, however, remain skeptical of Mr. Zuckerberg's approach.</p><p> The newly formed Internet Accountability Project is a conservative advocacy group aiming to get the federal and state government to rein in Big Tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Google.</p><p> \"I'm glad he's doing it, but these kinds of pats on the head are not enough,\" said Rachel Bovard, IAP senior adviser and former legislative director for Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, of Zuckerberg's trek to Georgetown.</p><p> Ms. Bovard said platforms such as Facebook \"allow human misery to flourish\" and the time has come for meaningful action from government. Congress this week began taking new action in the realm of internet regulation.</p><p> Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee Republican and leader of the Judiciary Committee tech task force, convened a closed-door meeting with policy experts Wednesday about consumer data privacy rights.</p><p> Participants included Maureen Ohlhausen, former acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission and Baker Botts partner; Nathan Taylor, Morrison &amp; Foerster partner; Michelle Richardson, the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology's director of its privacy and data project; and Jennifer Daskal, an American University associate law professor.</p><p> The House Energy and Commerce Committee, also on Wednesday, held a hearing on \"fostering a healthier internet to protect consumers\" featuring testimony from Steve Huffman, co-founder and CEO of Reddit, and Katherine Oyama, Google's global head of intellectual property policy.</p><p> Next week, Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to face the House Financial Services Committee to answer questions about Facebook's new cryptocurrency endeavor, named Libra.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-176A5B0D087511D0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X99-GP51-DXVP-V50V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>18 October 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The European Union and its member states have so far been more aggressive than the United States, confronting Silicon Valley over competition issues and imposing data protection rules that have set a new global standard.</p><p>\"The EU is leading in this space while the US continues to fall behind, which will likely mean that we will continue to see a pattern of Europeans regulating American companies,\" said Alina Polyakova, CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a think tank based in Washington.</p><p>The European Commission has hit Google with three antitrust penalties totaling (EURO)8.2 billion ($8.9 billion) since 2017. And in December, the Commission launched preliminary investigations into how Google and Facebook gather, process, use and monetize data for advertising purposes. </p><p>Last week, Facebook suspended the rollout of its dating service in Europe --- planned for the eve of Valentine's Day --- after officials from the Irish data regulator searched its offices. The regulator supervises Facebook because the company's European headquarters is in Dublin.</p><p>Such moves have put pressure on US tech executives to engage closely with leaders on the region. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet, made his own trip to Brussels last month.</p><p>\"There is no question in my mind that artificial intelligence needs to be regulated,\" he said at a conference organized by Bruegel, an economic think tank.</p><p>Facebook released a paper on Monday outlining the company's views on a range of proposed policies for government regulation. The company said it does not support laws that seek to hold platforms liable for content posted by its users.</p><p>Polyakova said that Zuckerberg's visit to Europe shows that he's realized there are advantages to being at the table while the debate unfolds \"rather than being on the confrontational path.\" </p><p>Still, the social media giant faces no shortage of critics. In a letter to Zuckerberg dated Friday, Manfred Weber, the leader of the largest group in the European Parliament, called for Facebook to \"show more transparency\" on how its algorithms are designed, claiming that regulation would be \"the ultimate option\" if the CEO didn't enter into conversations with EU officials.</p><p>He pointed to the new coronavirus outbreak as \"yet another sad example\" of how misinformation can rapidly spread on the platform thanks to \"un-transparent algorithms.\"</p><p>--- Sharon Braithwaite, James Frater, Nina dos Santos and Brian Fung contributed reporting.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Elizabeth Warren's[3] presidential campaign. Warren has made breaking up big tech companies like Facebook a central point of her campaign. She has also publicly criticized Facebook's decision to exempt political ads from its misinformation policy. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[4] Facebook employees have been in contact with Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign regarding the candidate's concerns with political ad policy, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told NBC Nightly News, and Bloomberg reported.[5] Zuckerberg has not spoken with Warren himself, and he did not elaborate on what exactly the staffers talk about. Facebook and the Warren campaign did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Warren, a democratic candidate for president, has been vocally critical of Facebook[6]. Breaking up big tech companies, including Facebook, is a key part of her campaign, and she has said that she would appoint regulators[7] to undo anti-competitive mergers, such as Facebook's ownership of WhatsApp[8] and Instagram[9]. In leaked audio published by The Verge[10], Zuckerberg said that a Warren presidency would \"suck\" for Facebook.

Facebook tried to push back directly against Warren[14] on Twitter, tagging her in a tweet, to which she responded: \"You're making my point here.

Trump and rival social network Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Zuckerberg said in an interview that his influential platform, which reportedly has 2.5 billion global users, \"shouldn't be the arbiter of truth\" in fact-checking everything people say online.</p><p>It came as <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/trump-tweet-tagged-with-factchecking-warning-from-twitter-a4451361.html\">Twitter marked one of the president's tweets</url> -making unsubstantiated claims about widespread fraud in absentee postal voting, known as mail-in ballots in the US -as misleading for the first time.</p><p>His since-deleted post repeating his often made \"rigged election\" allegations was tagged with an alert message telling other users to \"Get the facts about mail-in ballots\".</p><p>Studies have not shown widespread evidence of this, with CNN reporting that one law professor found just 31 instances of such fraud between 2000 and 2014.</p><p>Postal voting is expected to increase dramatically in the November presidential elections, with Trump seeking a second term, due to concerns about in-person voting amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>But Mr Zuckerberg has criticised Twitter after its new labelling system flagged the presidential's tweet on the subject.</p><p>He told Fox News: \"We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this.</p><p>\"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg added: \"In general, private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.\"</p><p>Facebook also funds a fact-checking programme, but when Mr Trump posted the same comments there about postal votes it was not labelled or removed.</p><p>The social network said the post had not broken its rules due to its belief that \"people should be able to have a robust debate about the electoral process\".</p><p>It came as President Trump, a prolific Twitter user with more than 80 million followers, prepared to sign an executive order -which gives him direct powers to enforce laws -on social media .</p><p>In the early hours today, he again tweeted accusations that \"Big Tech\" was trying to \"censor\" ahead of the election.</p><p>The president has previously threatened to shut down social platforms online that he accused of choking conservative opinion.</p><p>No further details on the executive order were given by White House officials and there is uncertainty over what legal powers he has to create such regulation without the approval of Congress.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Zuckerberg \u2014 without specifically naming Dorsey \u2014 said at the start of the call that Facebook has done 'more than any of the other major internet platforms to build positive incentives into our system,' and complained that it runs political ads just like Google and YouTube, but receives more blowback for it. Reiterating comments he's made several times in the last month, Zuckerberg said that Facebook's opposition to limiting certain kinds of political ads, such as ads containing blatant falsehoods, is grounded in support for freedom of speech. </p><p>That policy has been harshly criticized by some pundits and left-wing politicians \u2014 most notably, 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren \u2014 who have called for the company to stop publishing ads containing misinformation. Also Read: The Case for Breaking Up Facebook, Google and Big Tech | PRO Insight[1] On Monday, several hundred Facebook employees signed an open letter[2] that also strongly criticized those policies, and urged the company to reconsider. Zuckerberg did not address that letter during his remarks Wednesday. Zuckerberg said during the call that Facebook has been criticized from both the political right and left, but that the company's goal isn't to 'make either side happy.' 'Our values on voice and free expression are not partisan,' Zuckerberg said. 'But unfortunately in our current environment, a lot of people look at every decision through the lens of whether it's going to help or hurt the candidate they want in winning the next election.' Political ads, Zuckerberg added, make up only 0.5% of Facebook's projected 2020 revenue. (The company, after posting $17.7 billion in Q3 revenue, has already made nearly $50 billion this year.) 'I expect that this is going to be a very tough year. We try to do what we think is right, but we're not going to get everything right,' Zuckerberg said. 'And anyone that says the answers are simple, hasn't thought long enough about all the nuances and downstream challenges.' Also Read: Facebook's Privacy Woes Continue: Company Admits Transcribing Users' Audio[3] Earlier Wednesday, just as Facebook's earnings were being released, Dorsey announced that Twitter[4] would stop almost all political advertising on Nov. 22. 'We believe political message reach should be earned,' Dorsey tweeted.'A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people.'

Several attendees asked CEO Mark Zuckerberg[2] to cede some control. The shareholders said the changes were needed so that the company could more capably combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech on the social network. </p><p>\"We are sick and tired of apologies,\" one attendee said. All the shareholder proposals seeking changes were defeated, as expected, because of Zuckerberg's majority control of the votes. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] Mark Zuckerberg faced a lineup of critics on Thursday urging him to relinquish some of his power over the world's largest social network during a fraught shareholder meeting in which the 34-year-old CEO and his leadership team swatted away calls for management changes at Facebook while promising to do better. Several attendees who took the floor at Facebook's annual meeting on Thursday blamed Zuckerberg for the spread of misinformation and toxic content on the social network, and they asked whether he was open to changes, such as stepping down as chairman of the company board and breaking up the company. The answer in all cases was no. Zuckerberg reiterated his calls for government regulations to address what he called societal problems involving acceptable political speech and personal privacy. \"There are limits to what an individual company should be deciding on this,\" Zuckerberg said. But he dodged attempts to hold him accountable and sidestepped shareholder calls for changes to his own role. When a shareholder asked Zuckerberg whether he would be willing to resign as board chairman and eliminate the supervoting shares that give him majority control of the company, Zuckerberg launched into remarks about the importance of government regulation. When the shareholder tried to steer Zuckerberg back to the question, the moderator announced that each person was limited to one question and moved on. Another shareholder insisted that he be allowed to address Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Facebook's lead independent director, asking if she would convene a special meeting to replace Zuckerberg as chairman. \"The answer is no. I don't have the intention of calling such a meeting and as outlined in the proxy that's not the direction we want to take the company,\" Desmond-Hellmann replied. A slate of eight shareholder proposals, several of which sought to limit Zuckerberg's power, were all voted down. That was no surprise, given that Zuckerberg controls the majority of the vote through the supervoting shares. A full tally of the votes, expected within four days, will provide a more meaningful measure of the level of discontent or support for Zuckerberg among shareholders.'My neighborhood has become unsafe'The meeting comes at a time when Facebook is under attack from both sides of the political spectrum, with critics, including several presidential candidates[4], saying Facebook's ownership of Instagram and the messaging app WhatsApp makes the company too powerful. There have been several calls to break up the company, including from Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes. Facebook has 2.7 billion users who use one or more of its products every month, the company said on Thursday, and 2.1 billion people use one of its services every day. One attendee said she belonged to the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh that was attacked by a gunman who killed 11 people in October. \"We are sick and tired of apologies,\" she said. \"Facebook is in many ways my neighborhood,\" the attendee, who identified herself as a millennial who grew up online, said. \"Under the direction of Zuckerberg and Sandberg, my neighborhood has become unsafe.\" Another attendee, wearing a hoodie that read \"Men are Trash,\" faulted the company for allowing racists to run free on the social network while labeling the clothes that her business sells as hate speech and banning her shop on Facebook.NOW WATCH: Now that Google and Nintendo offer digital video games, GameStop could have the same fate as Blockbuster[5]See Also: 'It is unwise to have so much power concentrated in one person': Here's the stinging message that will be read to Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday by an investor who wants to take him down[6]Facebook's scandals weren't enough for people to stop using it.

When the shareholder tried to steer Zuckerberg back to the question, the moderator announced that each person was limited to one question and moved on.</p><p>Another shareholder insisted that he be allowed to address Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Facebook's lead independent director, asking if she would convene a special meeting to replace Zuckerberg as chairman.</p><p>\"The answer is no. I don't have the intention of calling such a meeting and as outlined in the proxy that's not the direction we want to take the company,\" Desmond-Hellmann replied.\u00a0</p><p>A slate of eight shareholder proposals, several of which sought to limit Zuckerberg's power, were all voted down. That was no surprise, given that Zuckerberg controls the majority of the vote through the supervoting shares.</p><p>A full tally of the votes, expected within four days, will provide a more meaningful measure of the level of discontent or support for Zuckerberg among shareholders.</p><h>'My neighborhood has become unsafe'</h><p>The meeting comes at a time when Facebook is under attack from both sides of the political spectrum, with critics, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-break-up-big-tech-billboard-in-san-francisco-2019-5?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">including several presidential candidates</url>, saying Facebook's ownership of Instagram and the messaging app WhatsApp makes the company too powerful.

Yeah.

The New York Times reported the contents of his trash after following San Francisco garbage picker Jake Orta in an affluent suburb of the city. Items retrieved from Zuckerberg's trash included a working coffee machine, A...iet root beer, and Chinese takeout boxes. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg has been battling a string of privacy scandals at Facebook, but this weekend, he might well be contemplating a privacy breach even closer to home. After millions of Facebook users had their data exploited by Cambridge Analytica in 2016, the contents of Zuckerberg's trash has been scraped and reported on by The New York Times[1]. In an interview with the Times on Sunday, trash picker Jake Orta \u2014 who lives three blocks from Zuckerberg in a single-window apartment \u2014 described how he rummages through San Francisco garbage bins for items to sell. Among his targets, is a blue recycling bin and a black landfill bin outside the Facebook CEO's $10 million home in the west coast city. According to the Times, items retrieved by Orta from Zuckerberg's garbage include: A working coffee machine A working vacuum cleaner A hairdryer, again in working order A...iet root beer cans Junk mail The remains of a chicken dinner A stale baguette Chinese takeout boxes At one point, Orta pulls apart a black bag and says: \"Just junk \u2014 nothing in there.\" As the Times points out, Orta and others are apparently undeterred by the fact that trash picking is illegal in the state of California.

Representative Maxine Waters said the company's \"existing deficiencies and failures\" needed to be fixed before launching a cryptocurrency.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, to face questions on his troubled Libra digital currency project.Zuckerberg faced a wide variety of questions on election interference, free speech, hate groups and fake news, from members who were critical of the social media company.His testimony comes just two days after the company disclosed the removal of a network of Russian accounts targeting US voters on its Instagram platform.The Facebook CEO had last appeared before Congress in April 2018, when he spent 10 hours over the span of two days answering questions from House and Senate panels over political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of user data to interfere in the 2016 US election.Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used the opportunity of Wednesday's hearing to ask Zuckerberg when he became aware of Cambridge Analytica. The Facebook founder said he was not sure.Read more: Facebook returns to center of British politicsOcasio-Cortez then grilled him over political ads on Facebook, asking Zuckerberg if his platform would allow ads that deliberately lied to users.\"In a democracy, I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that the platform did draw the line at content that incites violence or voter suppression.Questions of trustFacebook's founder faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats alike, with several congress members saying they did not trust Facebook to provide its users with a cryptocurrency, given its record.But some Republicans were a bit more sympathetic and argued that the government should not stand in the way of innovation in the private sector.\"I have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech,\" said Representative Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the panel. </p><p>\"But if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation.\"Read more:Is Facebook doing enough to combat fake news? Faltering Libra projectZuckerberg promised that his company would seek US regulatory approval before launching Libra. The digital currency project has received its fair share of criticism over fears it may enable money laundering and upend the global financial system.To date, several financial partners including Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and eBay have backed out of the Libra project. But Zuckerberg is moving ahead, partnering with a Switzerland-based consortium, which included venture capital firms and nonprofits, to make it happen.\"Why do a number of these founding members have concerns of whether you're up to the task of meeting our money laundering and regulatory standards?\" Republican Representative Ann Wagner asked.The 35-year old CEO conceded that companies dropped out because Libra is a \"risky project\" and that ultimately, he was not sure it would even work.\"It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,\" Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters told Zuckerberg.jcg/se (Reuters, dpa, AP)Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

I'm not taking questions,' he told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday as he walked into a meeting. </p><p>Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, arranged the dinner meeting - at an unnamed restaurant - at Facebook's request, according to a spokesperson.</p><p>'At Facebook's request, Senator Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington for Mr. Zuckerberg and a group of Senators,' Warner's spokesperson Rachel Cohen said in a statement.</p><p>'The participants had a discussion touching on multiple issues, including the role and responsibility of social media platforms in protecting our democracy, and what steps Congress should take to defend our elections, protect consumer data, and encourage competition in the social media space,' she said.</p><p>Zuckerberg is making his first trip to the nation's Capitol since he took a beating from lawmakers about his company's practices in an April hearing before Congress. </p><p>His visit comes as lawmakers are looking at regulating social media companies and are weighing a new privacy law that would hamper the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data.</p><p>The Facebook founder has called for government officials to take a more active role in regulating the Internet.</p><p>'The rules governing the Internet allowed a generation of entrepreneurs to build services that changed the world and created a lot of value in people's lives,' Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post in March. 'It's time to update these rules to define clear responsibilities for people, companies and governments going forward.' </p><p>Facebook declined to release Zuckerberg's schedule or comment on who was at the Wednesday evening dinner and who paid for it.</p><p>'Mark is in Washington, D.C., to meet with policymakers and talk about future internet regulation. There are no public events planned,' said Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone in a statement. </p><p>Zuckerberg will meet with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, according to a congressional aide, and he met with Senator Maria Cantwell Wednesday evening separately from the dinner, her office told DailyMail.com.</p><p>Cantwell is the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, which is debating online privacy legislation. </p><p>Schiff is investigating foreign interference in the 2016 election, which Facebook and other social media companies have had to defend their policies following revelations Russia used their platforms to influence the presidential contest. </p><p>Additionally, Zuckerberg met with Republican Senators Mike Lee of Utah, who is the chairman of the anti-trust subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary panel.</p><p>'We need robust investigations and enforcement of the antitrust laws, especially in the tech arena,' Lee said in a statement Wednesday after lawmakers on Senate Commerce Committee questioned executives from tech companies about the spread of extremism and violence on digital platforms. </p><p>Lee's office said the two men spoke on a number of issues. </p><p>'Sen. Lee and Mr. Zuckerberg touched on a number of topics including bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, government regulation of digital platforms, antitrust enforcement, Section 230 liability, and data-privacy issues,' a Lee spokesperson said of the meeting.</p><p>Zuckerberg also met with Josh Hawley of Missouri, who is a huge conservative critic of Big Tech. </p><p>'The visit from the Facebook CEO also comes the Federal Trade Commission launched an antitrust investigation into the company.</p><p>During his April testimony on Capitol Hill, lawmakers pressed the Facebook founder on how third-party partners - like Cambridge Analytica - could harvest data without users' knowledge. </p><p>They also asked Zuckerberg about fake news on Facebook, if there was a bias against conservatives and about Russian interference in the 2016 election. </p><p>One person not on Zuckerberg's agenda is Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>'Not on schedule, no request received,' a senior congressional aide told DailyMail.com when asked if the two would meet.</p><p>Pelosi criticized Zuckerberg and Facebook in May after the company did not remove an altered video that slurred her words and made the speaker appear drunk.</p><p>Zuckerberg reached out to her after the incident but she did not return his phone call. </p><p>The speaker accused Facebook of 'lying to the public' and saying it shows 'they were willing enablers of the Russian interference in our election.' </p><p>Facebook warned users the video of Pelosi is fake but it refused to remove the altered footage of her speech at a Center for American Progress event, which was subtly edited to make her voice sound garbled and slowed down, as if she was under the influence of alcohol. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-56242306</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X35-84P1-F021-63K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"939\"/><timeReceived>7:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

He is speaking about Facebook, the global corporate beast that he helped unleash and which he is now devoted to raging against.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I don't have any personal animus here at all,\" he continues. \"I actually understand how these guys got there. Do I wish they hadn't got there? Of course I do. But am I shocked? No.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All this might provoke a raised eyebrow from McNamee's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Mark Zuckerberg. Since dramatically falling out with Facebook after the 2016 US election, McNamee has become one of the company's foremost critics, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/14/twitter-facebook-really-taking-responsibility-role-influencing/\">accusing it of ruining elections</url>, violating privacy, promoting extremism and poisoning public debate through its attention-grabbing news feed algorithms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He describes the use of such algorithms, bluntly, as \"the equivalent of drinking a bottle of Scotch and then getting behind the wheel\". He calls <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/14/twitter-facebook-really-taking-responsibility-role-influencing/\">Libra, Facebook's new global digital currency,</url> \"a pretty fundamental attack\" on the power of nation states. To the now-common aphorism \"if you're not paying for it, you're the product\", he shoots back: \"Bulls---! You're the fuel - not even the product.\"</p><p>His book, released last February and chronicling his Damascene conversion, is Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe.</p><p>\"The tech industry is today where the chemicals industry was in 1960,\" he says. \"Where the medicine industry was in 1900. Where the building trades were after the great fires [of the US 19th century]... in each case we determined that these industries were so important to the future of the economy that you couldn't afford to let them operate without some regulatory supervision.\"</p><p>This warning carries all the more weight because of McNamee's history. Starting as a fund manager for T Rowe Price in the Eighties, he soon became a high-flying Silicon Valley insider, founding three investment firms (his most recent, Elevation Partners, was a joint venture with the U2 singer Bono) and backing Netscape, Amazon, Electronic Arts and Seagate.</p><p>At the time, he compared himself to Forrest Gump - an innocent who accidentally finds himself on the front lines of history. (He is also a touring musician with the rock band Moonalice.)</p><p>To a young Zuckerberg, however, McNamee was an elder sage. At their first meeting in 2006, he urged the 22-year-old founder not to sell his company to anyone, even for a billion dollars (an eye-watering price back then). In fact, Yahoo had already made that exact offer; Zuckerberg followed the advice and turned it down.</p><p>Over the next three years McNamee became one of Zuckerberg's mentors, most notably convincing him in 2007 to hire Sheryl Sandberg, who remains in post as Facebook's hugely influential chief operating officer.</p><p>\"There are a lot of things about Mark that are very cool,\" says McNamee, who is now 63 years old. \"In a world full of misogynists, I don't think Mark is. When I brought him the idea of hiring Sheryl, he embraced it. I'm serious: there are a not lot of people in Silicon Valley who would have done that, OK?... I thought Mark would be different. And that part was right.\"</p><p>McNamee is no longer in contact with either executive, but he still speaks of them fondly. \"I knew them intimately when we were all younger. I had a great relationship with them,\" he says.</p><p>He describes Zuckerberg as \"precocious\", with \"exceptional entrepreneurial skills at an unusually young age\"; \"socially awkward\", certainly, but not in an uncomfortable way.</p><p>\"I enjoyed his company,\" he concludes. \"Remember, Silicon Valley's got a lot of socially awkward people. And there are times when I've been awkward.\"</p><p>Hence, when McNamee first become alarmed about Facebook's effect on society, he first tried to approach the pair \"as a friend\". Only when that effort was rebuffed did he throw himself into rallying support in Washington DC and beyond for greater regulation of Big Tech.</p><p>Today, he fears that Zuckerberg has acquired an almost messianic belief in his own work, motivated by a drive for \"efficiency\" that is incompatible with the messiness of human liberty.</p><p>\"[Mark] looks at the world through his own lens,\" McNamee says. \"He thinks that the thing he is doing is the most important thing anyone could be doing right now. He has more people using his product every month than there are citizens in any country; he's larger than the largest religions. And he has concluded from this that Facebook no longer should be controlled by any sovereign nation.\"</p><p>Among the most disconcerting changes, he says, has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/14/twitter-facebook-really-taking-responsibility-role-influencing/\">Zuckerberg's \"embrace\" of Donald Trump</url>. Despite its overwhelmingly liberal workforce and reputation for Left-wing bias, many of its key policy advisers come from the US Republican Party, beneficiaries of a pragmatic hiring strategy that McNamee describes as \"classic Sheryl\".</p><p>More recently, Zuck himself has been criticised for undisclosed meetings with conservative politicians, including Trump himself, and has begun <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/14/twitter-facebook-really-taking-responsibility-role-influencing/\">inveighing against the dangers of a rising China</url>, one of the President's favourite themes.</p><p>\"Mark has learned a lot about politics in the last two years,\" says McNamee. \"I think it's pretty clear that when he went to Washington in 2018 he really went as a novice. And he has been very effective for the most part since then.\"</p><p>McNamee sees Facebook's decision to exempt politicians from its fact-checking programme, among other policies, as an attempt to curry favour in Washington and shield the company from unwanted regulation. So far, he claims, it has worked.</p><p>A spokesman for Facebook disputed that picture, saying that McNamee had not been involved with the company for years and that he was ignoring its \"massive investments\" in safety and election security. \"The notion that we are aligned with any one political figure or party runs counter to our values and the facts,\" she added.</p><p>Facebook also maintains that its algorithms no longer seek to maximise users' attention, and are instead crafted to ensure that people enjoy the service even if that means using it less.</p><p>But McNamee is not impressed by the self-regulatory measures that Facebook has adopted since 2016: not its advert library, not its forthcoming \"supreme court\", not the privacy reforms pressed upon it by US trade regulators and not the deal it made with civil rights activists to stop advertisers from discriminating by race and gender.</p><p>\"I don't believe that Facebook has made any changes that mean anything... this was mostly about trying to appear to be cooperative without actually being cooperative,\" he says.</p><p>That is why he continues to press for far stricter regulations than Zuckerberg wants, arguing that the industry will not change unless forced to. He has high hopes for the British Government's plan, announced after a campaign by The Telegraph, to impose a legal duty of care on social media firms and to make individual executives personally liable for the worst breaches.</p><p>Yet he is adamant that regulators must go further, interpreting the duty as a ban on all forms of attention-based algorithmic selection. \"Every time a terrorist who was motivated by Facebook kills somebody, [that's] due to algorithmic amplification,\" he says. \"The outcome from this business model is that people are going to get hurt.\"</p><p>Ultimately, he believes that stricter regulation will be good for the industry, helping it \"move onward\" from the \"damage\" it has done. \"I have no grudges, right?\" he says. \"I look at them and I think what's going on right now is probably very frustrating to them.\"</p><p>Granted, there is \"no way on God's green earth\" that they will undertake the necessary changes voluntarily. But then, that is why Roger McNamee is no longer asking nicely.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-60732381</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YB8-8601-F021-617T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1281\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 2, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

'He was receptive and thoughtful.'</p><p>'I've always thought that he wanted to make things right by conservatives,' said another person familiar with the dinners. 'I think he's been genuine in hoping that might happen. Sometimes I think the headwinds are so strong in Palo Alto that I don't think even he can succeed.'</p><p>Zuckerberg met with Graham earlier this year, who at a 2018 congressional hearing charged Facebook had become a monopoly. A spokesman confirmed the meeting with the South Carolina senator. </p><p>There also were meetings between Zuckerberg and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a critic who has called him 'the death of free speech in America,' and conservative radio talk host Hugh Hewitt, who called for a regulatory crack down on 'big tech bias' against conservatives, reports Politico.</p><p>Both declined to comment. </p><p>Others at the Zuckerberg meetings included CNN commentator Mary Katharine Ham, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, American Enterprise Institute fellow and former Washington Free Beacon editor Matt Continetti, Town Hall editor and Fox News contributor Guy Benson, and Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell, according to the person familiar with the gatherings. </p><p>Washington Examiner chief political correspondent and Fox News contributor Byron York confirmed his attendance, but declined to disclose discuss details because the conversation was off-the-record. </p><p>Political and Silicon Valley insiders say Zuckerberg has been hosting the dinners since July, and suspect his motives are to be friendlier with right-wing conservatives after Trump's upset with Facebook this past June.</p><p>The president complained about alleged biases against conservatives on social media, and said the government should sue Facebook and Google. </p><p>He alleged social media companies under the control of Democrats and that Twitter was making it difficult for followers of his has account, @realDonaldTrump, reports Bloomberg.</p><p>'What they did to me on Twitter is incredible,' Trump said in the interview with Fox's Maria Bartiromo. 'You know I have millions and millions of followers but I will tell you they make it very hard for people to join me at Twitter and then make it very much harder for me to get out the message.'</p><p>A cybersecurity resercher and former government official based in Silicon Valley said that chatter in the tech region 'is that Zuckerberg is very concerned about the Justice Department, under Bill Barr, bringing an enforcement action to break up the company.' </p><p>'So the fear is that Zuckerberg is trying to appease the Trump administration by not cracking down on right-wing propaganda.' </p><p>When asked about the gatherings, Politico reports that a senior Trump administration official said 'the White House is looking for meaningful steps from Facebook on a number of fronts,' including 'competition, free speech for everybody including conservatives, and privacy.'</p><p>'Nominal outreach won't cut it,' the official said.</p><p>The list of grievances recently filed against companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon have come from both sides of the aisle: </p><p>The companies are too big and powerful. They're bad for privacy, public discourse, democracy and small business. They're spying on us, contributing to economic inequality and hooking us and our children on addictive, useless services.</p><p>The companies themselves object to these characterizations, though how loudly they object varies.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, urged Twitter to suspend President Trump's account for violating the service's rules, while Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri was among those conservatives who say they have been unfairly treated. </p><p>Hawley has also said Zuckerberg should sell off its popular side businesses, WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>Beyond discourse and privacy, antitrust concerns have emerged as a major concern for lawmakers and candidates. </p><p>Leading the pack has been Democratic Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies. </p><p>She garnered immediate support, even from rivals such as Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who retweeted Warren for what he said was the first time. Cruz said 'she's right - Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech.'</p><p>Since then, calling out the tech behemoths and other big corporations has been a pillar of Warren's presidential campaign. </p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders, another leading Democratic candidate, has also said breaking up Amazon, Google and Apple is 'something we should definitely take a look at.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-56965441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8H-2D71-F021-6003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"989\"/><timeReceived>7:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

However, Zuckerberg has structured the company so that he has more voting power than all other shareholders combined. It's clear we need more than shareholders to make this happen. We need an internet-wide vote of no confidence. Zuckerberg's resignation would send a message to tech workers, government regulators, advocates, and all who hold Silicon Valley accountable that leadership at these companies is a privilege, not a right.</p><p>\"I know that we don't exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now, to put it lightly,\" Zuckerberg<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/technology/facebook-ftc-fine-privacy.html\">quipped</url> at the recent F8 developers conference, forcing a guffaw.

Zuckerberg to Soon Defend Libra in Front of Congress Committee When Libra was unveiled in June of this year, Maxine Waters, the Chairwoman of the house Financial Services Committee, was one of the first politicians to make a comment.Like many of her peers across the globe, Waters was overtly critical, calling for a moratorium on the development of the crypto project. The Congresswoman was unable to get her wish granted, with David Marcus of Facebook's Calibra, the firm's cryptocurrency subsidiary, only pledging to work closely with authorities to ensure the project was compliant.Regardless, she has continued her advocacy against Libra, hence this latest hearing announcement. </p><p>In two weeks' time, Facebook CEO Zuckerberg is slated to be the sole witness at the aforementioned hearing, which has been entitled 'An Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors.'Zuckerberg said in an internal Facebook meeting, whose transcripts were leaked by The Verge[2], that he is open to meeting with regulators to help them cope with their concerns regarding Libra. The Silicon Valley darling purportedly said:'We already focus a lot on real identity, across especially Facebook, so there's even more that we need to do in order to have this kind of a product. And we're committed to doing that well, and part of doing that well is not just building the internal tools and showing up and saying, 'Hey, we think we've solved this,' but addressing and meeting with all the regulators up front, hearing their concerns, hearing what they think we should be doing, making sure other folks in the consortium are handling this appropriately.'Zuckerberg's expected testification will satisfy the requests of members of the Committee, of which some urged for the Facebook founder to appear in the House when David Marcus was grilled in July.At the time, Brad Sherman, a Congressman from California, likened Libra's potential damage to the lives of Americans to 9/11, before adding that it should be Zuckerberg himself addressing the House, not an executive.While Waters's announcement did not discuss what exact topics will be discussed, she has previously been critical of the project's potential to pose a threat to traditional finance and of Facebook's checkered history with data and the privacy of said data. Keep Big Tech Out of Finance The House at large doesn't seem to be open to banning Libra outright, yet there have been discussions regarding a draft bill titled 'Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act', which would banbig names in technology from 'establishing, maintaining, or operating a digital asset' that is meant to fulfill the three fundamental tenets of money: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.As reported by Blockonomi previously[3], firms that fit into the bill's jurisdiction are technology firms that sport an annual revenue of over $25 billion and are focused on offering marketplaces, exchanges, or mediums in which individuals and groups can connect (social media).

A Facebook spokesperson said Zuckerberg will discuss \"a framework for new rules and regulation for the internet\" with EU officials. Facebook faces a host of potential regulatory difficulties in the EU, including new taxes, regulations on AI, and two antitrust investigations. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Mark Zuckerberg is going on a lobbying mission to Brussels in February. \"Next month, Mark Zuckerberg will travel to Europe to participate in the Munich Security Conference, and meet with European decision-makers in Brussels to discuss a framework for new rules and regulation for the internet,\" Facebook confirmed to Business Insider in a statement. Bloomberg first reported the news[2]. \"New rules and regulation for the internet\" leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and Facebook did not immediately respond when asked by Business Insider what exactly the tech billionaire will be discussing with lawmakers \u2014 but the company faces a slew of difficulties. The news of Zuckerberg's trip comes just one week after the EU's tech regulator Margrethe Vestager said[3] the EU could introduce laws taxing the revenues big tech companies make in European countries, similar to radical tax plans proposed in countries including France and the UK. The timing of the visit will also coincide with the EU introducing a white paper on future regulation for artificial intelligence, as was first reported by Bloomberg[4] earlier this month. Facebook along with Google and Twitter has also been pushing back against moves to make tech companies liable for illegal content hosted on their platforms. The EU said in a statement last year[5] it would publish its assessment on the matter in early 2020. The social network giant is also facing two antitrust probes from the EU. The first is into Facebook's proposed plans to launch its own cryptocurrency called Libra[6], and the second is into how it collects and monetizes user data[7]. One thing is certain: Zuckerberg will not be short of topics for discussion.NOW WATCH: How autopilot on an airplane works[8]See Also: Hillary Clinton slammed Mark Zuckerberg as 'authoritarian' and

The New York Democrat used the integration of the two apps and Acton s statements to<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes </emphasis>that he had been  coached  by Facebook to make certain statements to EU regulators, as a means to show how the social network giant has played fast and loose with vows to regulators.\u00a0</p><p> Do you understand why this record makes us concerned with Facebook entering the cryptocurrency space?  said Congresswoman Velazquez.  Do you realize that you and Facebook have a credibility issue here? \u00a0</p><p>Facebook is the target of antitrust probes from nearly every state. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice are also reportedly probing the social network to investigate whether it has violated antitrust laws.\u00a0</p><p>In 2014, when Facebook was finalizing its $22 billion acquisition of the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp, it needed to get approval from EU antitrust regulators. To prep for the meeting with about a dozen representatives from the European Competition Commission, Acton said he was instructed by Facebook to tell EU regulators that there were no plans to merge Facebook s and WhatsApp s data systems which he and his cofounder Jan Koum believed was true at the time.</p><p>\u00a0 I was coached to explain that it would be really difficult to merge or blend data between the two systems,  Acton said to<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes</emphasis>.\u00a0</p><p>But shortly after, WhatsApp launched new terms of service that showed the two systems had merged. The EU fined Facebook $122 million in 2017 for giving  incorrect or misleading information. </p><p> It just makes me angry to even relive that,  Acton said to<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes </emphasis>last year. Acton, today worth $2.5 billion, left WhatsApp at the end of 2017. Several months later in March 2018, he famously tweeted  #deletefacebook  as the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.</p><p>When the EU fined Facebook, a Facebook spokesperson said that the errors were unintentional. Zuckerberg s response to Velazquez s line of inquiry today alluded to the same sentiment, implying that the business plan had just changed.  I understand we have work to build trust on this,  Zuckerberg said.  That means making commitments, even if we learn new things in the future that could change our mind on how we should operate. </p><p>A spokesperson for Facebook elaborated on Zuckerberg s response, saying  it s both factually wrong and offensive for the Congresswoman and other regulators to be characterizing this as Facebook having  lied    and worse, suggesting that we  coached  WhatsApp to lie. </p><p>Congresswoman Velazquez remains skeptical of Zuckerberg s characterization of what happened, that the business plan had changed after Acton s statement to the EU.  It is another reason members are worried about Facebook s involvement/entrance into the cryptocurrency sector,  a spokesperson for Congresswoman Velazquez wrote in an email.</p><p>Zuckerberg was called to testify before Congress for his role in developing Libra, a cryptocurrency that will mostly be supported by dollars and designed to be spendable anywhere in the world.

Zuckerberg defended the new ad policy, which largely exempts politicians from Facebook's fact checkers, during an interview[1] with The Washington Post, telling reporters that Americans probably don't want a company being the arbiter of what is fact and what is lie. 'People worry, and I worry deeply, too, about an erosion of truth,' he said ahead of a speech at Georgetown University. </p><p>'I don't think people want to live in a world where you can only say things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true.'(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Facebook's critics laid into the big tech billionaire after the social media platform decided[2] in September to exempt politicians like President Donald Trump from a fact-checkers' gavel. Media pundits believe the change will cause a dramatically uptick in misinformation across the internet. Other Facebook executives have made similar free speech arguments. Nick Clegg, the company's vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a Sept. 24 blog post that Facebook will treat speech from politicians 'as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard.' There will also be exceptions, as Facebook's release notes: 'Where speech endangers people; and where we take money, which is why we have more stringent rules on advertising than we do for ordinary speech and rhetoric.' Zuckerberg took Clegg's point a step further during the WaPo interview.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Sponsored Content  Zuckerberg warned that Facebook could be perceived as 'potentially cracking down too much.' He also called on government regulators to craft tailored rules to help moderate political speech online. Democrats and various liberal journalists are pushing back on Facebook's philosophical positioning. 'Facebook changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies\u2014explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine. This week, we decided to see just how far it goes,' Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in an Oct. 12 tweet. She then added a screenshot of the ad, which claimed[3] Facebook and Zuckerberg are endorsing Trump, who frequently criticizes the company for censoring conservatives. Warren, who's running for president, clarified that the ad was designed to show how easily it is to promote false information on the platform.

In doing so, he tried to situate Facebook as a modern proxy in a storied legacy of civil rights movements, citing the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, the late civil rights advocate Rep. Elijah Cummings, and Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIn times of social turmoil, our impulse is often to pull back on free expression. We want the progress that comes from free expression, but not the tension,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from Birmingham Jail, where he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully.\u201d</p><p>Zuckerberg\u2019s name-check did not go unnoticed by King's daughter, who suggested on Twitter that she thinks her father\u2019s message was twisted in the service of Facebook\u2019s aims.</p><p>\u201cI'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,\u201d King said. \u201cThese campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d</p><p>Throughout his speech, Zuckerberg emphasized Facebook\u2019s precarious current position not as a key moment for the beleaguered yet wildly rich company, but as a crossroads for humanity itself. Facebook has often benefited from this conflation, which both elevates and obscures the company's own driving business self-interest.</p><p>\u201cWe are at a crossroads,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe can either stand for free expression... or we can decide the cost is simply too great. We must continue to stand for free expression.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s likely to recycle some of the talking points next week, when he appears before Congress to defend his company's plans for its own form of digital currency, called Libra.</p><p>For now, he didn\u2019t get into that. In typical Zuckerberg style, he opined about how his platform brings people together\u2014a morally ambiguous mission that Facebook has always coded as a de facto social good. He declared social media the \"fifth estate,\" a social force \"alongside the other power structures in our society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard, and that has important consequences,\u201d Zuckerberg said, taking a swipe at the company\u2019s two most troublesome checks and balances.</p><p>Dressed as a hacker-saint, solemn in a black long sleeved shirt and black pants, Zuckerberg addressed a captive audience at a chapel-esque Georgetown event hall. To get in, lines wrapped in and around the building.</p><p>It's clear that Facebook plans to double down on strategically framing itself as a champion for free speech in its multi-front war. Those fronts include going up against Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) in the House next week over his company's sweeping plans to develop a global cryptocurrency, fending off antitrust probes from the DOJ and state attorneys general, and de-escalating the conflict with newly front-running Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who has made taking big tech down a notch a pillar of her campaign. Not to mention the company\u2019s other big existential worry: that lawmakers could dismantle Section 230, the liability shield that tech companies have flourished under, ironically co-authored by one of Facebook\u2019s fiercest critics in Congress.</p><p>Taking the focus off of his company, currently beset from all sides, Zuckerberg looped back time and time again to Facebook's core mission of \"Giving more people a voice\"\u2014a quest that regulation would certain dampen. Facebook prefers to project an image of a business dutifully serving what just so happens to be two billion individuals rather than a digital advertising mill grinding users into valuable grist, an image critics are more likely to paint.</p><p>While he mostly kept the speech high-level, Zuckerberg did dip into a few policy specifics. For one, he positioned Facebook as a bulwark against the threat of a Chinese technological takeover, setting up his own company as a potent symbol of Western values that must be preserved at any cost. So much for Facebook\u2019s plans in China.</p><p>He also defended the company's stance on allowing political ads with no fact-checking or oversight process. \"I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\" Zuckerberg said.</p><p>Zuckerberg admitted that his company has thought about abandoning its practice of running political ads altogether, which make up an inconsequential sliver of the company's business. He argued that if Facebook pulled back from running political ads, it would have to make all kinds of other sticky determinations about what is and is not a political ad.</p><p>\"There are many more ads about issues than there are ads about elections. Do we ban ads about healthcare, immigration or women\u2019s empowerment?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to ban those, does it really make sense to give everyone else a voice in political debates except for the candidates themselves?\u201d</p><p>He went on to argue that political advertising \"can be an important kind of voice\" and that disallowing it favors incumbents and \"whoever the media chooses to cover.\"</p><p>Facebook and other major tech platforms have recently shied away from articulating platform policies in depth, instead addressing situations as they arise in context and leaving plenty of wiggle room. For Facebook, the preferred decision is one that doesn't lead to a cascade of other decisions.</p><p>\"I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies,\" Zuckerberg said.</p><p>For his part, Zuckerberg still believes that users should make their own determinations, a position that positions Facebook conveniently\u2014if unrealistically\u2014above the fray.</p><p>\"I believe in giving people a voice because at the end of the day, I believe in people,\" Zuckerberg said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2306371723</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X98-SMK1-DY0W-446T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"977\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

From disinformation and hate speech to its election content, his company is under pressure. Plus today he'll need to give specifics on Facebook's plan for a new digital currency. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond has the story. And I should note that Facebook is one of NPR's financial supporters.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BOND:                 The last time Mark Zuckerberg testified at a congressional hearing he was under fire over whether a political consulting firm used the private information of Facebook users as part of an effort to sway the 2016 election. A year and a half later, that immediate crisis has passed. But Facebook is under even more pressure and scrutiny today. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren says Facebook has too much power.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN:                 I say it's time to break them up. Let's enforce the antitrust laws. I'm there.             </p><p>                            (APPLAUSE)                </p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN:                 Big tech - yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I'm looking at you.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Facebook started as a place for college students to find each other. But now, it has become the world's most influential social media site and a crucial place for politicians to reach voters. Along the way, it's become vulnerable to misinformation, manipulation, propaganda. Critics say Facebook needs to take more responsibility now that it's so big.             </p><p>VANITA GUPTA:                 There is kind of a denial of just how sweeping that role is and a real harms that the platform can have on vulnerable communities, communities of color without adequate guard rails in place.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 That's Vanita Gupta, a former Justice Department official. She now heads up the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Many of her concerns will be front and center today.             </p><p>Facebook has been accused of enabling discrimination through its ad tools. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has sued Facebook over this issue. The federal agency says Facebook let advertisers show or hide housing ads from users based on their race or where they live.             </p><p>                Nicol Turner Lee is a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Technology Innovation.             </p><p>NICOL TURNER LEE:                 In the case of Facebook, what I think we're seeing is that the tool is being used in ways that I think that they did not plan for.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Facebook says it has stopped letting advertisers target ads for housing, jobs and credit to people based on their ethnicity or where they live. And just yesterday, it pledged $1 billion for affordable housing in California.             </p><p>                But Facebook wants to go further into people's lives. And Zuckerberg will have to defend his plans for a new global, digital currency - Libra. Regulators worry it could be used for illegal activity like money laundering or to fund terrorism. The currency is still in the theoretical stages, but it's already in jeopardy. Just in the past couple of weeks, some crucial partners, including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, have dropped out entirely.             </p><p>MICHAEL PACHTER:                 Libra sounds dead on arrival.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Michael Pachter is an analyst with Wedbush Securities.             </p><p>MICHAEL PACHTER:                 I don't think Facebook can pull it off without the support of all of the different banking and credit - you know, card processors and payment processors. I just don't think that they have the wherewithal to actually do it themselves.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Beyond the headline topics, members of the House Financial Services Committee will get to ask Zuckerberg about everything else on their minds too; what is the company doing to stop election interference? Is it biased against conservatives as some politicians claim? Why does it let politicians lie in ads? There may even be questions about whether Facebook should be broken up, as Elizabeth Warren is calling for, a scenario Zuckerberg roundly rejects. With Facebook on the defensive and lawmakers eager to pile on, there could be fireworks.             </p><p>                Shannon Bond, NPR News, San Francisco.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)            </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-2019102303</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBD-J351-JBKP-Y2N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And does that still suck for us? Yeah.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He added: \"But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"</p><p>According to The Verge, the audio comes from two open meetings Zuckerberg held with Facebook employees in July, the same month it agreed to pay an unprecedented $5 billion penalty in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over its handling of users' personal data. The audio included question and answer sessions with Zuckerberg. </p><p>A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story.</p><p>\"What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\" Warren tweeted on Tuesday in response to Zuckerberg's comments.</p><p>The audio offers a rare behind-the-scenes look at how Zuckerberg discusses Facebook's regulatory troubles inside the company's walls, rather than in press interviews and public testimony before Congress. </p><p>Facebook now faces antitrust probes from the FTC and from eight states and the District of Columbia. The House Judiciary Committee is conducting a \"top-to-bottom\" antitrust probe of Big Tech, including Facebook. And multiple Democratic presidential candidates, including Warren, have called for greater scrutiny of tech companies and potentially even breaking them up. </p><p>Earlier this year, Warren released an aggressive plan to break up tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google. The far-reaching proposal would impose new rules on certain kinds of tech companies with $25 billion or more in annual revenue. It also aims to undo major mergers in the industry, such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp and Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods. </p><p>In the leaked audio, Zuckerberg said he's against breaking up big tech companies, and that doing so won't \"actually solve the issues.\" He also said it would make election interference more likely because then companies couldn't coordinate and work together. </p><p>In explaining why he thinks being bigger is better, Zuckerberg also threw shade at Facebook's smaller rival Twitter. </p><p>\"It's why Twitter can't do as good of a job as we can. I mean, they face, qualitatively, the same types of issues,\" he said. \"But they can't put in the investment. Our investment on safety is bigger than the whole revenue of their company.\"</p><p>\"It's not about money, it's about getting the work done and solving problems for the people we serve,\" Brandon Borrman, a spokesperson for Twitter, said in a tweet Tuesday. \"Mark clearly thinks differently. Keeping people safe and secure is in our shared interest as an industry and we ALL have more to do.\"</p><p>CNN Business' Donie O'Sullivan and Hadas Gold contributed to this report</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Additionally he met with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday.</p><p>Dressed in a suit and tie - instead of the hoodie and jeans he famously wore when he founded his social media giant - Zuckerberg didn't answer questions from reporters as he walked through the Capitol complex from meeting to meeting. </p><p>His lobbying campaign comes as lawmakers are weighing a new privacy law that would hamper the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. Plus the both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice are conducting anti-trust probes.</p><p>Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said after an earlier meeting with Zuckerberg that they had also discussed the anti-trust investigation of big tech companies.</p><p>'I encouraged him to come to the table, help us out - and this is not an adversarial role from my perspective,' Collins said, according to Reuters. 'I think with their involvement, you are going to see a lot more participation.' </p><p>House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy was also at the meeting. </p><p>Last week, lawmakers demanded internal emails, detailed financial information and other company records from top executives of Amazon, Facebook Inc, Apple and Google, widening the antitrust probe of the tech giants.</p><p>The companies have until Oct. 14 to produce internal emails sent over the last decade by Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page, among others, about acquisitions and other issues.</p><p>Facebook said Zuckerberg is in the nation's capitol to talk about internet regulation.</p><p>'Mark is in Washington, D.C., meeting with policymakers to hear their concerns and talk about future internet regulation. He also had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,' a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.</p><p>Zuckerberg had a closed-door dinner with senators Wednesday night as part of his trip to Washington D.C. to lobby lawmakers on privacy and regulation issues important to Facebook, the social media giant he founded. </p><p>Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, arranged the dinner meeting - at an unnamed restaurant - at Facebook's request, according to a spokesperson. </p><p>'At Facebook's request, Senator Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington for Mr. Zuckerberg and a group of Senators,' Warner's spokesperson Rachel Cohen said in a statement.</p><p>'The participants had a discussion touching on multiple issues, including the role and responsibility of social media platforms in protecting our democracy, and what steps Congress should take to defend our elections, protect consumer data, and encourage competition in the social media space,' she said.</p><p>Zuckerberg made his first trip to the nation's Capitol since he took a beating from lawmakers about his company's practices in an April hearing before Congress. </p><p>He also met with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, who spoke with him about election interference. </p><p>'I wanted to raise my profound concern about the issue of deepfake technology and how it might be used to disrupt our election,' Schiff told reporters after the meeting. 'They are very aware of the threat that it poses. They are in the process of developing what I hope will be very strong policies on this. </p><p>Zuckerberg also met with Senator Maria Cantwell Wednesday evening separately from the dinner with senators, her office told DailyMail.com.</p><p>Cantwell is the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, which is debating online privacy legislation. </p><p>Additionally, Zuckerberg met with Republican Senators Mike Lee of Utah, who is the chairman of the anti-trust subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary panel.</p><p>'We need robust investigations and enforcement of the antitrust laws, especially in the tech arena,' Lee said in a statement Wednesday after lawmakers on Senate Commerce Committee questioned executives from tech companies about the spread of extremism and violence on digital platforms. </p><p>Lee's office said the two men spoke on a number of issues. </p><p>'Sen. Lee and Mr. Zuckerberg touched on a number of topics including bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, government regulation of digital platforms, antitrust enforcement, Section 230 liability, and data-privacy issues,' a Lee spokesperson said of the meeting.</p><p>Zuckerberg also met with Josh Hawley of Missouri, who is a huge conservative critic of Big Tech. </p><p>Hawley pushed him to sell off WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>But he noted Zuckerberg was not 'receptive' to the suggestion he offered. </p><p>'I said to him, prove that you're serious about data. Sell WhatsApp and sell Instagram,' the Missouri senator said, according to CNBC, after their Capitol Hill meeting.</p><p>And Zuckerberg was spotted coming out of the office of Texas Senator John Cornyn. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-56274532</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3C-R9K1-JCJY-G02X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1050\"/><timeReceived>9:22 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Zuckerberg made his comments in the latest excerpt of his interview with 'CBS This Morning'[1] co-host Gayle King that aired on Tuesday. He acknowledged there are 'real issues' that come with running a giant social media company, before adding: 'a lot of people are upset and are talking about measures like breaking up the company that aren't actually going to fix these issues, right?</p><p> I mean, breaking up Facebook isn't going to address the question of political discourse.' Also Read: Hillary Clinton Says Facebook Chief Mark Zuckerberg 'Should Pay a Price' for Harm to Democracy[2] Zuckerberg's focus on political discourse comes after the company has been skewered by many of its critics for its decision to not fact-check its political ads. Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen recently ripped[3] Facebook for the stance, joining Sen. Elizabeth Warren in criticizing Facebook's political ad policy. Zuckerberg reiterated to King this week something he's said several times in the last few months: he believes it's better to have Facebook's users decide what is and isn't true in political ads, rather than the company. Sen. Warren has also called for[4] breaking up Facebook, Amazon and other tech stalwarts if she's elected president next year. The company's critics have complained Facebook's $1 billion buyout of Instagram and its $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp have helped the company create a social media juggernaut \u2014 and block any competitors from rising up in the process. Despite the added pressure from lawmakers and regulators, antitrust experts told TheWrap[5] earlier this year that the breakup of major tech firms is anything but a sure thing. Penn State antitrust professor John Lopatka said there are 'two necessary ingredients' that would be needed to take action against a company like Facebook: Not only does there have to be proof Facebook is a monopoly, but you'd also have to show Facebook extended its monopoly 'through anti-competitive conduct.' Also Read: Facebook Has 'No Plans' to Fact-Check Its Political Ads[6] 'We can assume Facebook has monopoly power in the social media platform market, but that's not enough,' he continued. 'You still have to prove it acquired or maintains that power through anti-competitive power, and I don't know any reason to believe that's the case.' Zuckerberg, in his interview with King, said he's 'absolutely' in favor of more government regulation. When asked if 'one person, or one company' should have 'that much power,' Zuckerberg said 'the basic answer to what you're saying is 'no,'' before adding 'private companies should not be in the position of making so many important decisions, balancing different social values that we all care about.' But breaking up Facebook to get to that point is a bridge too far, in his view.

I'm really sorry this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data.\"<br/> His plans did not represent a big reduction of advertisers' ability to use Facebook data, which is the company's lifeblood.<br/> Facebook shares pared gains on Wednesday after Zuckerberg's post, closing up 0.7 percent. The company has lost more than $45 billion of its stock market value over the past three days on investor fears that any failure by big tech firms to protect personal data could deter advertisers and users and invite tougher regulation.<br/> Facebook representatives including Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman met U.S. congressional staff for nearly two hours on Wednesday and planned to continue meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Facebook was unable to answer many questions, two aides who attended the briefing said.<br/> Zuckerberg told the website Recode that he was \"open\" to testifying before the U.S. Congress and that fixes to protect users' data would cost \"many millions of dollars.\" (<url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/2IJbYJS\">http://bit.ly/2IJbYJS</url>)<br/> The whistleblower who launched the scandal, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, said in a tweet that he had accepted invitations to testify before U.S. and UK lawmakers.<br/> The German government said Facebook must explain whether the personal data of the country's 30 million users were protected from unlawful use by third parties, according to a report in the Funke group of German regional newspapers.<br/> 'Scapegoat'<br/> On Tuesday, the board of Cambridge Analytica suspended its Chief Executive Alexander Nix, who was caught in a secret recording boasting that his company played a decisive role in Trump's victory.<br/> But the academic who provided the data disputed that on Wednesday.<br/> \"I think what Cambridge Analytica has tried to sell is magic, and they've made claims that this is incredibly accurate and it tells you everything there is to tell about you. But I think the reality is it's not that,\" psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, an academic at Cambridge University, told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.<br/> Kogan, who gathered the data by running a survey app on Facebook, also said that he was being made a scapegoat by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Both companies have blamed Kogan for alleged data misuse.<br/> Only 300,000 Facebook users responded to Kogan's quiz, but that gave the researcher access to those people's Facebook friends as well, who had not agreed to share information, producing details on 50 million users.<br/> Facebook has said it subsequently made changes that prevent people from sharing data about friends, and maintains that no data breach occurred because the original users gave permission. Critics say that it essentially was a breach because data of unsuspecting friends was taken.<br/> Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica from using any of Facebook's services on Friday.<br/>  Zuckerberg said the company \"will restrict developers' data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse\" and that the company is working with regulators as they investigate what happened.<br/>  Many analysts have now raised concerns that the incident will have a negative impact on user engagement with Facebook, potentially reducing its clout with advertisers. Three Wall Street brokerages cut their price targets.<br/>  \"Investors now have to consider whether or not the company will conclude that it has grown in a manner that has proven to be untenable or whether it needs to significantly improve how it is managed,\" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser.<br/>  Facebook shares are down more than 8 percent since Friday. The company has risen more than 550 percent in value in the past five years.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10433282</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXW-J6B1-DYDW-72G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"796\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Mark Zuckerberg has said he thinks \"good regulation will hurt Facebook's business in the near term.\" The Facebook CEO made the remark in a Financial Times op-ed article published Sunday[2], in which he discussed the regulation of social-media platforms like Facebook and what this regulation should look like. Zuckerberg is visiting Brussels to meet with European regulators on Monday as the European Union plans to introduce new rules about the regulation of artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg added in his article that \"good regulation will be better for everyone, including us, over the long term.\" Discussing how to make regulation more open, transparent, and accountable, he said: \"These are problems that need to be fixed and that affect our industry as a whole. If we don't create standards that people feel are legitimate, they won't trust institutions or technology.\" Zuckerberg added that poorly considered regulation could inadvertently benefit bigger players like Facebook. \"If regulation makes it harder for [smaller firms] to share data and use these tools, that could disproportionately hurt them and inadvertently advantage larger companies that can,\" he said. \"Still, rather than relying on individual companies to set their own standards, we'd benefit from a more democratic process.\" The 35-year-old also touched upon an issue that's come to prominence much more recently: political ads. Facebook has faced criticism from across the political spectrum for its refusal to fact-check political ads[3] and for allowing political ads containing lies on its platform[4]. Though Zuckerberg didn't address the issue directly, he did say it's often tough to decide what counted as a political ad in the first place. \"We believe advertising is more transparent on Facebook than television, print, or other online services,\" he wrote. \"We publish details about political and issue ads \u2014 including who paid for them, how much was spent, and how many people were reached \u2014 in our ads library. \"But who decides what counts as political advertising in a democracy? If a non-profit runs an ad about immigration during an election, is it political? Who should decide \u2014 private companies, or governments?\" These latter comments come after Facebook decided not to categorize[5] sponsored memes from the US Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg as political ads.NOW WATCH: Inside the US government's top-secret bioweapons lab[6]See Also: Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook is 'happy to pay more tax in Europe'[7]From Elon Musk to Tim Cook,

The two people hired by the Buttigieg campaign now work in technology-related roles. One is a senior digital analytics adviser, while the other is an organizing data manager.Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is one of several people seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination for president.The Buttigieg campaign didn't respond to HuffPost's request for comment, but spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed the reporting to CNBC[5]. He said the recommendations were made 'around the launch when we were getting a ton of incoming resumes.'On Twitter, Lis Smith, Buttigieg's senior communications adviser, emphasized that the recommendations were made on behalf of potential hires asking for an introduction to the Buttigieg campaign \u2015 not the other way around.'[This is] a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing,' Smith wrote Monday[6]. 'We get [recommendations] from hundreds of people and we've received thousands and thousands of resumes.'Zuckerberg addressed the matter in a Monday morning press conference, where he said his emails aren't an endorsement of the candidate. </p><p>He portrayed his emails to the campaign as not much more than sending over the resumes of colleagues who'd asked him to put them in touch.'I did a Facebook live event with [Buttigieg] a couple years back, so it's widely known that I've met him,' Zuckerberg said.In almost any other context, this would be a non-story. Bosses provide letters of recommendation all the time.But given Facebook's extreme political influence, and the numerous fronts on which the tech giant is defending itself \u2015 claims of bias[7], proposed regulations[8] supported by Buttigieg's competitors[9], profiting off[10] foreign election meddling, the company's own high-level right-wing ties[11], and awritten policy of allowing politicians to lie[12], to name a few \u2015 any wisp of preferential treatment for the site (or from it) is a bad look for an ascendant presidential candidate.Not helping appearances: Zuckerberg is an acquaintance of Buttigieg, who often notes he was Facebook's 287th user[13]. (At that point in its existence, Facebook was a very different[14]website, a fact thatZuckerberg keeps lying about[15] in an apparent attempt to rewrite history.)Zuckerberg alsovisited Buttigieg in South Bend[16] in 2017.While some presidential contenders, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have publicly disavowed high-dollar fundraisers, Buttigieg has accepted plenty of Silicon Valley cash[17]. He defended his fundraising sources last week, telling Snapchat's Peter Hamby[18], 'We're not going to beat [President Donald Trump] with pocket change.'That's not to say Buttigieg hasn't been critical of the social media platform, which he's warned[19] has too much power and has 'a David mentality when they've increasingly turned into Goliath.' But unlike Warren,Buttigieg has stopped short[20] of full-throated calls for tech monopolies like Facebook to be broken up.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), like Warren, is a proponent of regulating Facebook[21], having sounded the alarm on 'unchecked corporate power[22]' earlier this year.
