It\u2019s become generally more... humiliating,\u201d offers Julianna, a top porn agent. \u201cAnyone can open the internet and find anything they want, and when you watch this, you go, ok, what\u2019s the next step? You\u2019re always curious about going deeper and deeper and deeper.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Julianna is the co-founder of Julmodels, an agency for porn performers based in Hungary. She is also one of the subjects of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pornocracy</emphasis>, an eye-opening documentary about the state of porn playing at SXSW. The crux of the film, directed by the French porn veteran turned director Ovidie, is that free XXX tube sites have not only left the adult industry in tatters, but are a pox on society: a danger to sex workers, forcing them into extreme acts of degradation due to dwindling demand, and to our youth, allowing them unfettered access to hardcore pornography.</p><p>The latter issue looms large in Ovidie\u2019s harrowing film, a stygian exploration into porn\u2019s white collar underbelly that likens its hoodied, pierced creator to a Lisbeth Salander-esque hacktivist truth-bombing the system. In one particularly cringe-inducing scene, Pierre Woodman, a renowned DIY porn filmmaker, captures the corrupting influence of tube sites.</p><p>\u201cThe root of it all is that internet piracy is killing adult movies, streaming content that should only be for adults but that is now unfortunately available to young people as well,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fed up with hearing every day during casting sessions a girl who says, \u2018Oh I\u2019ve known you since I was eight years old.\u2019 That\u2019s just <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">too much</emphasis>.\u201d</p><p>After navigating her way past performers, handlers, and producers, Ovidie\u2019s quest leads her to the kingpin: MindGeek, a multinational corporation with a near-monopoly on free streaming porn. The conglomerate owns all the sites in the Pornhub network, including YouPorn, RedTube, GayTube, Tube8, and Pornhub; as well as the porno studios Brazzers, Digital Playground, Reality Kings, Twistys, and the bulk of Playboy\u2019s digital and TV operations. But the sprawling company, which previously operated under the names Mansef and Manwin, has run afoul of the law on numerous occasions. In 2009, the Secret Service seized $6.4 million in funds from two fidelity bank accounts controlled by Mansef, with Feds accusing the syndicate of money laundering; and in 2012, its then-owner Fabian Thylmann, a young German programmer once hailed as the <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>of porn, was arrested on charges of tax evasion.</p><p>What <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pornocracy</emphasis> does is raises plenty of questions concerning MindGeek\u2019s operations. Why is it headquartered in Luxembourg, a notorious tax haven, when most of its operations appear to be run out of Canada? Do Wall Street hedge funds have a controlling interest in the company? Who is actually pulling the strings? How are these sites not violating copyright laws? And why is the money allegedly being routed through various countries to performers?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a fishy, weird company,\u201d says Stoya, a Digital Playground contract girl from 2007-2013, in the film. \u201cMy Fleshlight royalties, when the wire transfers come in, go through banks in places like South Africa. They have offices in Ireland. It\u2019s a bunch of men with Greek last names and thick Greek accents claiming to be Quebecois.\u201d</p><p>It all began with the \u201cgreat crash of 2006.\u201d That year, adult DVD sales experienced a sharp decline. The cratering coincided with the arrival of YouPorn, porn\u2019s version of YouTube featuring millions of pirated XXX videos that are free to stream. In 2011, YouPorn was purchased by Manwin, which proceeded to gobble up most of the other tube sites-before acquiring the adult industry\u2019s leading production studios as well. Female performer\u2019s wages dropped from around $3,000 to $600 a shoot, and even the biggest and brightest porn stars now flock to \u201cextreme\u201d sites like Kink for work. Today, many of the premier porn studios are struggling; pirated videos, on the other hand, make up approximately 95 percent of the porn consumed across the globe.</p><p>\u201cUp until 10 years ago, the industry consisted of a constellation of smaller producers who produced and sold their own content directly on DVD or via VOD,\u201d Ovidie tells me. \u201cWithin the past 10 years, the entire industry has been taken over by big tech companies, multinationals managed by businessmen based in tax havens who don\u2019t have any real connection to the porn industry. These people are not there on-set during shooting; they have no contact with the workers or the actual production process. What is happening in porn is exactly what\u2019s happening in many other sectors: an \u2018Uberisation\u2019 of the workforce, with huge platforms who have no consideration for performers.\u201d</p><p>The answer, Ovidie says, is for various governments to begin regulating these tube sites in order to protect minors from accessing them, which will in turn grant the adult industry a degree of latitude.</p><p>\u201cIn France, my film and the issues it tackles was taken very seriously on a national level, and politically by the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs. They are considering putting in place legal protections for minors. This is the most urgent thing that can be done,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Tube sites have no system to protect minors from watching, as opposed to paid porn sites where you generally at least need a credit card to watch. On the Tubes, the access is immediate, and they don\u2019t verify age. They are free, easy, and accessible via a phone. The age of porn site consumers has gone down dramatically, and the effects of this are catastrophic. If free access to porn is limited, then producers can get their funding back, start working legally again, and pay their talent fairly.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-1876114088</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKD-HCP1-DY0W-42XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"940\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 11, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Secret Service-US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Hungary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Luxembourg</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zuckerberg, Mark</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Motion picture directors &amp;

Check out their session on 'How to compete with tech giants' here[2]. In a world where tech products are now our lifeline to the world, what challenges and considerations are facing those who build them? Whereby's co-founder Ingrid Odegaard met up with Jon von Tetzchner, founder of web browsers Vivaldi and Opera to talk about why privacy matters, Norwegian work culture, and designing products with a community of users.  Jon von Tetzchner is a pioneer in the browser world, having first created the web browser Opera in 1995, and is now founder and CEO ofVivaldi[3], a feature-rich privacy-focused browser.Whereby[4]and Vivaldi share some of the same roots; started and headquartered in Norway, with both founders having spun their initial companies out of the Norwegian state-owned telco, Telenor. </p><p>I invited Jon tochat about the role technology plays in the current situation and to hear his reflections on why privacy is only increasing in importance, particularly with end-users becoming more and more conscious and concerned about how their personal data is being used. Ingrid degaard, co-founder and chief product and technology officer at Whereby: Jon, this is the second independent browser company you've started. Why do you feel that it's important to have competition within the browser market? The web browser is a tool that people spend a lot of time with, and there was a time when we were actually quite close to only having one. If that had been the case, we would have been left with just Internet Explorer, which dominated the market fully for a long time. I don't think anyone would have been happy with just one option, because even Microsoft themselves were not satisfied with Internet Explorer. It just shows the value of competition and how it drives the quality of software. Because of competition, we push each other! Browsers are very important because they are probably the most used pieces of software we have. So, having a choice and variety of browsers to choose from is crucial. At Vivaldi, you work closely with your users, adapting the browser to their needs. How do you do that and what drives your priorities? Instead of doing what people usually do when they develop software, which is looking at what others are doing, how people are using different software, and relying on aggregate data to make decisions, we prefer to listen to what people say. We have a group of volunteers called 'The Sopranos' within the Vivaldi community who help us test our browser. They spend a lot of time trying to help us to help others and we typically release builds to this group once a day or sometimes more often. We then release snapshots to the wider community once a week (or more) and that allows us to get continuous feedback on what we are doing. Our community connects in forums with almost 700.000 registered members, and they get free email and blogging services alongside the forum access. We have a mixture of good and bad feedback which come from people who typically have very strong and constructive opinions.Regardless of the type of feedback, it is invaluable to us because it helps us build a better product. In general, we try to build a product that gives people flexibility. We all have different ways of working. So with a tool that you use as much as a browser, being able to adapt it to your preferences is clearly important. In this current crisis, a lot of people have been forced outside of their comfort zone and have had to explore new tools and different ways of working. How do you think this will affect the way companies and people collaborate in the long term? A lot of people have had to work in a different way lately. But for us who work (literally) on the internet, this way of working isn't new. Understandably, however, many are trying to find ways to replicate the feeling of being in the office. When faced with a difficult situation, the natural reaction is to seek the comfort of being together with the people we trust and are used to working alongside. When everyone is sitting at home, we have to try and find ways to turn it into something positive rather than negative. As of now, it's my impression that a lot of people are learning that this can actually work really well! If some of the new ways of working stick, it may have accelerated a development that would have happened either way within the next three to five years. In Vivaldi, when we have a new need or problem to solve, we try every tool available to find the best fit. That's how we ended up using Whereby as our go-to video meeting tool across the company. Did you know that you can use tiled view in Vivaldi to open a video meeting next to whatever web page you're working on? We are seeing similar things from our new users, as other people start looking for alternative browsers. We are confident that we can be a better tool than other browsers out there. As soon as you spend more time online, you start organizing data and organizing what you're doing - and you want a browser that helps you do this! <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/growth-quarters/2020/09/29/why-privacy-must-be-at-the-core-of-every-tech-product-syndication/#Vivaldi\">https://thenextweb.com/growth-quarters/2020/09/29/why-privacy-must-be-at-the-core-of-every-tech-product-syndication/#Vivaldi</url> browser works great with Whereby video meetings, tiled video lets you open the video call next to any page you're working onHow do you think companies who were already working remotely pull ahead? They clearly have an advantage in today's situation. It depends on the type of company, but for us, it was quite normal to spend one day in the office and then the next at home. We didn't skip a beat when COVID-19 struck and everyone just continued working as normal from their homes. We have had flexibility in the workplace for such a long time, and now we saw the kind of resilience that gave us. However some companies, quite understandably, were not ready and had to deal with a big disruption in their operations. We even saw this with Google (because we work with Chromium), who usually have scheduled releases but suddenly, they skipped one. They announced an upcoming release, but then they pulled it and issued a statement that said they didn't know when they'd be back. You would think that a company like Google would be ready, but it just shows that there is real change andeveryoneis adapting. You recently launched new versions on both desktop and Android which both have in-built privacy tools. How have they been received? Was this something the community wanted? Today we are seeing so much data being collected, but I believe that this something that has only started happening over the last few years. There is an argument that supports data collection because that's partly how the internet is funded, but it operated well as a business model before it turned into a surveillance-type capitalist entity. This is something I feel needs to be changed and we have been advocating the need for this to be regulated. We delayed the initial Android release because we wanted to add a reliable tracker radar and ad blocker. We decided to work with DuckDuckGo because we believe that their Tracker Radar is one of the best and most effective as it allows us to stop a lot of that tracking that many people don't like. Many of our community members wanted this feature added into both versions, so we had to switch our thinking from just browser-based, to Android, too. Working on the Android version was more challenging because we ran into issues when using Chromium, so ended up using a native UI. We wanted to make sure we did it right and that it would work really well. I believe we have done this successfully because we have done it with the user in mind; each user gets to decide what they want to see, how much tracking they want to allow, and how many ads they want. Personally, I am in the camp where I would like to see the free internet remain, but on the other hand, I don't like tracking. I believe that regulation is needed, however, I do not think users should have the option to choose whether they are tracked because we know that this method doesn't work. The way that users acknowledge and allow cookies without necessarily checking what data they are collecting, is proof enough.<url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/growth-quarters/2020/09/29/why-privacy-must-be-at-the-core-of-every-tech-product-syndication/#Vivaldi\">https://thenextweb.com/growth-quarters/2020/09/29/why-privacy-must-be-at-the-core-of-every-tech-product-syndication/#Vivaldi</url> for Android has built-in privacy controlThere's a saying 'when you don't pay, you are the product'. At Whereby, we find that a lot of people are interested in understanding how we make money and what our ownership is, which is great, because our revenues do not come from ads or selling user data. We, and many startups like us, rely on a small proportion of users to pay for a better version of the product. But that's also a hard model to sustain especially when the big tech giants, offer the same thing for free. This is a model that we see a lot of and is often used by big companies. Take Google as an example. Google Maps is a wonderful service, but it actually has a dark side. In the beginning, Google offered its Maps API for free and then, after a while, started charging. It's an effective method of luring people in and, despite Google having some serious competitors in the maps market, by offering their product for free it becomes very difficult for any competitors to gain traction. Ultimately, competition is gone. If you only have one player in the market, things start to stagnate. The more competition there is, the more innovation you'll have and that's ultimately what we want to see. Nowadays, people also focus on privacy when looking to use a new product. Big companies in the United States undertake practices that hinder privacy and, in reality, should be illegal. The EU has been more willing to take on this fight with big companies and it's a really good thing because we need the competition, but we also need to have regulations on the data that is collected on people. Specifically, we need to ensure that building a profile on a user and then sharing that data is banned. There has been a lot of talk of the issues with targeted ads in the run-up to the last US presidential election, and now there is another one coming up. I don't think people who are not working in or with technology, really understand it at a deep level and may not understand why privacy is important. What do you think is needed in order to build that understanding? I think some countries are certainly more advanced than others when it comes to realizing the value of privacy and, as such, are already dealing with the situation far better. A lot of people, when considering privacy, only think about their personal privacy and often conclude that they have nothing to hide or that they simply don't care who knows what about them, but the issue, of course, goes far deeper than this. As such, the more society can be educated on the use of personal data and privacy the better. In my mind, the collection of personal information en masse by the likes of Facebook and Google needs to be far more heavily regulated, and power needs to be returned to the individual, who must be fully informed in order to be empowered. Experience shows that if people understand how and why their data is being collected they are far more willing to comply, particularly if it is being used in a way that is ultimately beneficial to them. What do you think will happen if this is not regulated in the long-term? We are beginning to see the consequences of the huge amount of tracking that is happening, particularly on how profiles are being built and how those profiles are being used to target ads towards us. Many people don't see this as an issue, but it's actually quite frightening and dangerous, knowing that we are being profiled for political purposes to get us thinking in a certain way. This can quickly turn into a battlefield and in some ways, we are already seeing that. For example, we have seen this happen in regards to the elections. We want our democracy to work in a different way rather than just getting spammed with opinions and being manipulated into having opinions we otherwise might not have. Being placed into 'boxes' based on who we are and what we think is - I think - a serious problem and it's there because of the issue surrounding the collection of data. I also believe that this system of targeted ads is having a consequence for publishers, too. But the real problem we are facing is a consequence of what some of the larger companies are doing; collecting data. We all need to start taking our users seriously because we want to support them, the media, and free internet content. I think regulation is the solution to this and I believe that would actually help the smaller, high-quality publishers and journalism in general on the internet. I really think that needs to be dealt with. The EU's approach with the privacy law GDPR has gone pretty far and has even forced some global companies, who want to target or serve the EU audience, to abide by their rules. However, it seems to only be forcing companies to be transparent about what they collect and give some control back to the user in what they consent to, but it doesn't really stop tracking. GDPR doesn't stop tracking and I think that this is the core. I am aware that they have some rules relating to this which may prove helpful over time, but at the moment, users are getting prompted to accept data collection or cookies, and are given very little choice in the matter. I am, however, starting to get the impression that everyone is collecting and sharing data in the same way which is, in fact, not the case. I believe there is a huge difference between someone that owns a website and collects information about those people visiting the site, versus other websites which will share information on everyone and everything, but this can sometimes be hard to tell apart because most websites use the same dialogue to show they are collecting user data. This is wrong. In fact, I believe that if a site is collecting basic website analytics, there should be no need to show or prompt the user that they are doing this, but I feel strongly that if a company or website is collecting information on a deeper level and at scale to share with other parties, this should be made more apparent. I think, particularly the big service providers like Google, which has access to a high level of information, should notify the user that they are collecting more than just basic information, but ultimately, should not be authorized to collect this level of data. I don't think people realize that even banks, at least in the USA, share information on what you purchase. Your location is also being tracked inside buildings and that information is then being used for ad targeting later. There are a lot of ideas surrounding ads in those types of settings and I think it's a massive problem. Further to this, I believe that the big problem is that people look at it as a personal problem instead of a societal issue. The majority of the general public won't be bothered by the fact that a company has information on them, but the real problem is how the data is used and by whom. When this data is then being used to target people at scale, it's really powerful and can be used to manipulate people's opinions. Different countries currently have different privacy laws and there is obviously a big difference between the US and Europe. Some countries may have even stricter regulations, even within Europe. Here in Norway, we have been quite far ahead and the value of transparency is within our culture and society. Do you think it could become an advantage for a technology company to be based in a country where the culture and regulation/laws around privacy are strict? On one hand, I think people will be looking to have access to software from companies that build ethically. On the other hand, I can see the reason as to why companies are collecting and selling data; it's lucrative. Data is being sold and utilised in ways that can drive a lot of revenue but, but at the same time, the revenue return per user is very small, so selling all of our information for a relatively small amount of money doesn't seem to be worthwhile for a small company, but big companies are clearly making a lot of money out of this. So, when you, as a company, decide to do things more ethically, in some ways, you don't have a benefit. However, I think that a lot of users want ethical companies because when people start seeing the difference between how their data is used (something that companies should be very careful with and not misuse) versus companies which take that data and build profiles, they will start to see a very big difference. I think more and more people are realizing that this is a problem, and are now starting to select the companies that are doing the right thing. So on to another topic, you've built two great companies (Opera and Vivaldi) from scratch and both with a very strong community and also very diverse teams with lots of international people. Can you talk about the principles that you have founded these companies on? At the core, it's about seeing the individuals. My teams have always been founded on the principles of Norwegian work culture that includes a flat structure, informal communication, and a strong sense of working together. At the same time, I have always built international teams. I know that people who come from various countries, sometimes struggle with these principles such as 'Yes, you can talk to the boss', 'Yes, you can even tell the boss your own opinion or tell them you are not happy with their decision' and not get fired. We applaud having discussions which are a really good thing. We've taken this very far, and a lot of it is about realizing that the employees are the most important part of the organization. When I started to build Vivaldi, we decided that we didn't want investors. I was lucky enough to come out of Opera with some cash, and that allows me to fund Vivaldi. With Opera, I didn't have that choice and it went in the wrong direction. I think this was due to the fact that we had to get other investors and unfortunately got unlucky with the choice of investors. Another important aspect is that Vivaldi is employee-owned. This isourcompany and we arebuilding it together. We are trying to create a good company culture. We are a distributed company. We have an HR manager in each of our three offices. Even though we are a small startupwith just over 50 employees, we stillhave five people that arededicated totaking care of allthe employees. I don't think there are many companies that have that kind of ratio, but we have really, really good people working on our employees' wellbeing. Anne Christiansen, one of the co-founders of Vivaldi, has worked with me at Opera. Werealized thattaking care of the employees and making sure they're happy, is an extremely important task. There are a lot of different details that you'll see that go into makingpeoplehappy. It's about things like food, flexibility and more. For example, we have a little playroom in our office for our peopleto bring theirkids to work if there areissues with their kindergarten or school. Although wewant people towork from the office, there's also flexibility to choose to work even from home whenever necessary. We also have regulargatherings every summer at our Innovation House in the US. The house has 30 bedrooms. This encourages as many people as possible to join us with their families. So this is definitely not very typicalwhere the company goes to someplace to have a big party for a weekend, and people come back with headaches. In our case, it is more of a family thing and a totally different experience. We also have smaller team gatherings in Iceland and Norway where we meet, work and go out to the countryside in nature. The gatherings are really important because we are not only staying together during work time, butare alsodoingthings together that result in strong bonds. Wetreat our users the same way. Our users are our expanded family that includes our testers called Sopranos, translators, and our community members. We treat them as our friends. Our working slogan is based ona simple thought; 'We are building a browser for our friends'. The basic principle is that you do not spy on your friendsbecause it's just not nice. Welisten to our friends and take their advice,comments and questions, and even criticisms because we think criticism amongst friends is fine. Coming back to the topic of ownership, do you think more companies should have a model where employees have ownership? Yes. I really believe in making surethat everyone is part of the team. My thinking has always been long-term and I thinkthis is veryScandinavian in someways,we have contracts with people thatare not here for only 2 weeks or at will. We work together with an intention to make things work for the long-term and look for people who believe in it. That's the basis for our relationship. I believemore companies should do that! I think after having taken a company public andgoingthrough the motions of raising cash, when it comes down to it, the ownership of the company is quite often controlled by the owners. Sometimes you are unlucky with the investors, and then you end up with the company going nowhere. We've seen this happen to so many companies in Norway and across the world; companies build to a certain level and then they sell out. In our case, we've been very clear - that's not what we want to do and that's not where we're going. We don't want to go public. We have a different mindset. We want to build a great company. We want to build great pieces of software. But I do understand why that's hard to do for most startups. That was the difficulty I had with Opera; we needed the money and we didn't have any other way to get the money. So I really don't see how we could have done things differently. As a result,we ended up getting some investors that weren't the best. I read on your blog that you are sponsoring a local football team in your local community and building communities seem to have been a theme throughout your career. Vivaldi started as a community and this situation where everyone is now working remotely and collaborating globally, what role do you see for the community? Could it maybe even be strengthened? One of the things we see with Whereby is how it's changing the lives of several of our employees and users. The ability to work remotely has allowed them to move to a small village where their families are or that are close to nature, with more affordable housing, increasing their overall quality of life in many ways. Communities are very important.And like you said, in my case it's about building communities and supporting the community around me. That includes the company andthe people around us. In my local community in Iceland, where I come from, we've decided to support the local football club. It's a small community of 4,000 people with400 kids in the club that includes more or less all the kids. The club plays a vital role in their lives, and gives them a sense of belonging. Supporting something like this is worthwhile. And it's something I would like to continue doing. In the same way, I've been trying to support startups.I amsupporting the StartupLab through the Founders Fund in Oslo. I have also set up theInnovation house in Iceland that offersspace for startups with no strings attached. Basically, they pay a little rent but we don't make them stay with us by asking for a piece of their company. It's actually the opposite and we'd like to support them in the best possible way to give them space to grow. It's not about ownership. It's about giving back. It doesn't have to be about return on investment, we can all just support each other. I think in this kind of society and with the issues we are having now on a global scale, what we are seeing on a local level is fantastic; people are going to great lengths to help each other. I believe in leadership which allows you to work together. This article was originally published on theWhereby blog[5]. You can read it here[6].

Check out their session on 'How to compete with tech giants' here.<br/>In a world where tech products are now our lifeline to the world, what challenges and considerations are facing those who build them? Whereby's co-founder Ingrid Odegaard met up with Jon von Tetzchner, founder of web browsers Vivaldi and Opera to talk about why privacy matters, Norwegian work culture, and designing products with a community of users.</p><p><br/>Jon von Tetzchner is a pioneer in the browser world, having first created the web browser Opera in 1995, and is now founder and CEO of\u00a0Vivaldi, a feature-rich privacy-focused browser.\u00a0Whereby\u00a0and Vivaldi share some of the same roots; started and headquartered in Norway, with both founders having spun their initial companies out of the Norwegian state-owned telco, Telenor.<br/>I invited Jon to\u00a0chat about the role technology plays in the current situation and to hear his reflections on why privacy is only increasing in importance, particularly with end-users becoming more and more conscious and concerned about how their personal data is being used.<br/>Ingrid \u00d8degaard, co-founder and chief product and technology officer at Whereby:<br/>Jon, this is the second independent browser company you've started. Why do you feel that it's important to have competition within the browser market?<br/>The web browser is a tool that people spend a lot of time with, and there was a time when we were actually quite close to only having one. If that had been the case, we would have been left with just Internet Explorer, which dominated the market fully for a long time. I don't think anyone would have been happy with just one option, because even Microsoft themselves were not satisfied with Internet Explorer. It just shows the value of competition and how it drives the quality of software. Because of competition, we push each other! Browsers are very important because they are probably the most used pieces of software we have. So, having a choice and variety of browsers to choose from is crucial.<br/>At Vivaldi, you work closely with your users, adapting the browser to their needs. How do you do that and what drives your priorities?<br/>Instead of doing what people usually do when they develop software, which is looking at what others are doing, how people are using different software, and relying on aggregate data to make decisions, we prefer to listen to what people say.<br/>We have a group of volunteers called \"The Sopranos\" within the Vivaldi community who help us test our browser. They spend a lot of time trying to help us to help others and we typically release builds to this group once a day or sometimes more often. We then release snapshots to the wider community once a week (or more) and that allows us to get continuous feedback on what we are doing. Our community connects in forums with almost 700.000 registered members, and they get free email and blogging services alongside the forum access.<br/>We have a mixture of good and bad feedback which come from people who typically have very strong and constructive opinions.\u00a0Regardless of the type of feedback, it is invaluable to us because it helps us build a better product.<br/>In general, we try to build a product that gives people flexibility. We all have different ways of working. So with a tool that you use as much as a browser, being able to adapt it to your preferences is clearly important.<br/>In this current crisis, a lot of people have been forced outside of their comfort zone and have had to explore new tools and different ways of working. How do you think this will affect the way companies and people collaborate in the long term?<br/>A lot of people have had to work in a different way lately. But for us who work (literally) on the internet, this way of working isn't new. Understandably, however, many are trying to find ways to replicate the feeling of being in the office.<br/>When faced with a difficult situation, the natural reaction is to seek the comfort of being together with the people we trust and are used to working alongside. When everyone is sitting at home, we have to try and find ways to turn it into something positive rather than negative. As of now, it's my impression that a lot of people are learning that this can actually work really well! If some of the new ways of working stick, it may have accelerated a development that would have happened either way within the next three to five years.<br/>In Vivaldi, when we have a new need or problem to solve, we try every tool available to find the best fit. That's how we ended up using Whereby as our go-to video meeting tool across the company. Did you know that you can use tiled view in Vivaldi to open a video meeting next to whatever web page you're working on? We are seeing similar things from our new users, as other people start looking for alternative browsers. We are confident that we can be a better tool than other browsers out there. As soon as you spend more time online, you start organizing data and organizing what you're doing - and you want a browser that helps you do this!<br/>Vivaldi browser works great with Whereby video meetings, tiled video lets you open the video call next to any page you're working on<br/>How do you think companies who were already working remotely pull ahead? They clearly have an advantage in today's situation.<br/>It depends on the type of company, but for us, it was quite normal to spend one day in the office and then the next at home. We didn't skip a beat when COVID-19 struck and everyone just continued working as normal from their homes. We have had flexibility in the workplace for such a long time, and now we saw the kind of resilience that gave us. However some companies, quite understandably, were not ready and had to deal with a big disruption in their operations. We even saw this with Google (because we work with Chromium), who usually have scheduled releases but suddenly, they skipped one. They announced an upcoming release, but then they pulled it and issued a statement that said they didn't know when they'd be back. You would think that a company like Google would be ready, but it just shows that there is real change and everyone is adapting.<br/>You recently launched new versions on both desktop and Android which both have in-built privacy tools. How have they been received? Was this something the community wanted?<br/>Today we are seeing so much data being collected, but I believe that this something that has only started happening over the last few years. There is an argument that supports data collection because that's partly how the internet is funded, but it operated well as a business model before it turned into a surveillance-type capitalist entity. This is something I feel needs to be changed and we have been advocating the need for this to be regulated.<br/>We delayed the initial Android release because we wanted to add a reliable tracker radar and ad blocker. We decided to work with DuckDuckGo because we believe that their Tracker Radar is one of the best and most effective as it allows us to stop a lot of that tracking that many people don't like. Many of our community members wanted this feature added into both versions, so we had to switch our thinking from just browser-based, to Android, too. Working on the Android version was more challenging because we ran into issues when using Chromium, so ended up using a native UI. We wanted to make sure we did it right and that it would work really well.<br/>I believe we have done this successfully because we have done it with the user in mind; each user gets to decide what they want to see, how much tracking they want to allow, and how many ads they want.<br/>Personally, I am in the camp where I would like to see the free internet remain, but on the other hand, I don't like tracking. I believe that regulation is needed, however, I do not think users should have the option to choose whether they are tracked because we know that this method doesn't work. The way that users acknowledge and allow cookies without necessarily checking what data they are collecting, is proof enough.<br/>Vivaldi for Android has built-in privacy control<br/>There's a saying \"when you don't pay, you are the product\". At Whereby, we find that a lot of people are interested in understanding how we make money and what our ownership is, which is great, because our revenues do not come from ads or selling user data. We, and many startups like us, rely on a small proportion of users to pay for a better version of the product. But that's also a hard model to sustain especially when the big tech giants, offer the same thing for free.<br/>This is a model that we see a lot of and is often used by big companies. Take Google as an example. Google Maps is a wonderful service, but it actually has a dark side. In the beginning, Google offered its Maps API for free and then, after a while, started charging. It's an effective method of luring people in and, despite Google having some serious competitors in the maps market, by offering their product for free it becomes very difficult for any competitors to gain traction. Ultimately, competition is gone. If you only have one player in the market, things start to stagnate. The more competition there is, the more innovation you'll have and that's ultimately what we want to see.<br/>Nowadays, people also focus on privacy when looking to use a new product. Big companies in the United States undertake practices that hinder privacy and, in reality, should be illegal. The EU has been more willing to take on this fight with big companies and it's a really good thing because we need the competition, but we also need to have regulations on the data that is collected on people. Specifically, we need to ensure that building a profile on a user and then sharing that data is banned.<br/>There has been a lot of talk of the issues with targeted ads in the run-up to the last US presidential election, and now there is another one coming up. I don't think people who are not working in or with technology, really understand it at a deep level and may not understand why privacy is important. What do you think is needed in order to build that understanding?<br/>I think some countries are certainly more advanced than others when it comes to realizing the value of privacy and, as such, are already dealing with the situation far better. A lot of people, when considering privacy, only think about their personal privacy and often conclude that they have nothing to hide or that they simply don't care who knows what about them, but the issue, of course, goes far deeper than this. As such, the more society can be educated on the use of personal data and privacy the better.<br/>In my mind, the collection of personal information en masse by the likes of Facebook and Google needs to be far more heavily regulated, and power needs to be returned to the individual, who must be fully informed in order to be empowered. Experience shows that if people understand how and why their data is being collected they are far more willing to comply, particularly if it is being used in a way that is ultimately beneficial to them.<br/>What do you think will happen if this is not regulated in the long-term?<br/>We are beginning to see the consequences of the huge amount of tracking that is happening, particularly on how profiles are being built and how those profiles are being used to target ads towards us. Many people don't see this as an issue, but it's actually quite frightening and dangerous, knowing that we are being profiled for political purposes to get us thinking in a certain way. This can quickly turn into a battlefield and in some ways, we are already seeing that. For example, we have seen this happen in regards to the elections.<br/>We want our democracy to work in a different way rather than just getting spammed with opinions and being manipulated into having opinions we otherwise might not have. Being placed into \"boxes\" based on who we are and what we think is - I think -\u00a0 a serious problem and it's there because of the issue surrounding the collection of data. I also believe that this system of targeted ads is having a consequence for publishers, too. But the real problem we are facing is a consequence of what some of the larger companies are doing; collecting data. We all need to start taking our users seriously because we want to support them, the media, and free internet content. I think regulation is the solution to this and I believe that would actually help the smaller, high-quality publishers and journalism in general on the internet. I really think that needs to be dealt with.<br/>The EU's approach with the privacy law GDPR has gone pretty far and has even forced some global companies, who want to target or serve the EU audience, to abide by their rules. However, it seems to only be forcing companies to be transparent about what they collect and give some control back to the user in what they consent to, but it doesn't really stop tracking.<br/>GDPR doesn't stop tracking and I think that this is the core. I am aware that they have some rules relating to this which may prove helpful over time, but at the moment, users are getting prompted to accept data collection or cookies, and are given very little choice in the matter. I am, however, starting to get the impression that everyone is collecting and sharing data in the same way which is, in fact, not the case. I believe there is a huge difference between someone that owns a website and collects information about those people visiting the site, versus other websites which will share information on everyone and everything, but this can sometimes be hard to tell apart because most websites use the same dialogue to show they are collecting user data. This is wrong. In fact, I believe that if a site is collecting basic website analytics, there should be no need to show or prompt the user that they are doing this, but I feel strongly that if a company or website is collecting information on a deeper level and at scale to share with other parties, this should be made more apparent.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M1550304</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60Y9-FNP1-JBYT-H46J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 29, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00096SV</classCode><className>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008X0B</classCode><className>STATE OWNED BUSINESSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000959</classCode><className>INTERNET BROWSERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N511200CC</classCode><className>SOFTWARE MAKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000916</classCode><className>INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001597</classCode><className>SOFTWARE TESTING &amp;

With the support of a German nonprofit called ThingsCon and a research fellowship from Mozilla, Bihr created a heptagonal Trustable Tech Mark awarded based on consistent criteria that would indicate to consumers whether the companies behind their smart speakers or connected appliances should be considered reliable stewards of sometimes-intimate information about their lives. The right to advertise based on your signals and behaviors is a tight thread to needle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cAs a consumer, it\u2019s basically impossible to find out which devices are OK\u2014you can only go by brand name essentially,\u201d Bihr said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie; I wish bigger organizations had tackled that a long time ago. But they didn\u2019t, so here we are.\u201d</p><p>As Bihr helps to establish one universal standard, smart device makers, software platforms and advertisers are grappling with a multitude of problems on how to monetize a world in which all manner of everyday objects may have the capacity to sell consumers something. With the IoT economy still in its infancy, many see it as the ideal time to set standards and practices in an attempt to avoid the same consumer trust issues that currently plague the rest of the digital marketing world.</p><p>\u201cWhat we want to be most careful not to do is to replicate the opaque and corrupt supply chain that everyone complains about in the existing digital advertising ecosystem,\u201d said Gartner digital marketing analyst Andrew Frank. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole litany of concerns\u2014privacy, security, the control over the experience itself, concerns over concentration of the market.\u201d</p><p>IoT advertising has been a topic of conversation at forward-thinking industry conferences, like last week\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show, for years now. But actual use cases still remain mostly in the conceptual or experimental stage, according to industry experts. One issue is that, like many early-stage tech markets, the space remains fragmented and advertising capabilities vary between different platforms and manufacturers, making universal standards difficult.</p><p>\u201cInternet of Things as it exists today is not the kind of interconnected network of data that it can eventually become\u2014all of the data is siloed by the actual thing and the manufacturer of that thing,\u201d said Sarah Mannone, evp at digital marketing agency Trekk. \u201cBecause we\u2019re in this phase right now where these devices are sort of disjointed and we don\u2019t have this interconnection yet \u2026 now is really a time for advertisers to establish themselves as it relates to standards around privacy.\u201d</p><p>Mannone said marketers should develop a set of ironclad consumer privacy commitments now that are incorporated clearly into website copy and marketing materials. A longstanding reputation for data security will become all the more important when consumers are deciding which brands they want to allow into the most personal aspects of their lives.</p><p>Some of the companies that are diving into IoT ads say the key to holding consumer trust is to approach them more as sponsored products that integrate with the functionality of a given device. Sal Dhanani, co-founder of location services company Telenav, which rolled out an in-car advertising platform earlier this year, said each of the promotions the company runs on its systems must offer more than simple display ads\u2014whether it\u2019s a gas pump coupon or deal listings from a nearby grocery store.</p><p>\u201cI tell the team, \u2018You\u2019re not putting ad units anywhere\u2014you\u2019ve got a normal product experience where you have the natural element to fulfill a use case,'\u201d Dhanani said. \u201cThe question is how we decorate that experience such that there\u2019s more value to the user\u2014we don\u2019t even call them ads; we want to offer a \u2018promotion\u2019 or \u2018predictive help.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Frank said he has faith that advertisers and their trade groups can learn from mistakes made in the digital advertising world and better self-regulate early enough to avoid losing consumer trust. But if they fail to do so, he expects GDPR-style regulation will eventually grow to encompass the IoT space.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of activity that\u2019s focused on trying to clean up [digital advertising] and make it more transparent and more accountable and so forth,\u201d Frank said. \u201cIt would be helpful if that were done before we just start to replicate today\u2019s practices on Internet of Things platforms.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1007411</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6C-M751-DYRK-H2RW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 13, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

This latest iteration of \"hipster antitrust\" is nothing more than competition regulation and expanded government control, repackaged for the Internet economy.<br/>And, unfortunately, antitrust is all the rage. In addition to the House Committee's investigation, both the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission have\u00a0announced antitrust investigations\u00a0into\u00a0Google,\u00a0Apple,\u00a0Amazon, and Facebook, with the DOJ handling the first two companies and the FTC handling the last two. Across the Atlantic, the European Union has already\u00a0gone after Google\u00a0with an antitrust fine. This is at odds with the fact that these firms' products and services have benefited consumers with rapid innovation and falling prices.</p><p><br/>But today's antitrust crusaders accuse companies of everything from harming potential business rivals and contributing to society's income inequality to destabilizing communities. Yet, the success of these tech companies is due to providing tangible, life-enhancing products and services for consumers, shareholders, and the economy at large. But that same success also foments suspicion and resentment about corporate scale and influence, generating calls for government regulation and forced breakups.\u00a0<br/>Prominent political figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren, for instance, are calling for increased antitrust action across the economy, expressing special concern for tech giants' use of data. In\u00a0a recent interview\u00a0with\u00a0The Nation, Warren claimed that, \"[d]ata is power,\" and decried the use of data to offer tailored advertising to consumers. But giving consumers options while making money is a far cry from actual harm, and she doesn't go on to give any examples of concrete harm to consumers from data collection or use. Skipping proof of actual injury, she goes on to champion the breaking up of tech firms if only government regulators had \"the will\" to do so.<br/>Since the birth of antitrust in 1890 the playbook has been the same: Skeptics of free markets set their sights on a successful company (or companies), assign blame for the ill du jour, and then recommend changes to antitrust policy to ensnare alleged bad behavior in a freshly-expanded antitrust net.<br/>In the 1990s, it was the \"network effects\" of Microsoft-including when the company started bundling its Internet Explorer web browser with its desktop software-that justified a fresh run at antitrust enforcement. Considering that the rise of Apple, Google, and other innovative technology companies rendered the war between Internet Explorer and competitors such as Netscape Navigator irrelevant, it's obvious the quickly shifting tech industry is a particularly poor target for government antitrust action.\u00a0<br/>Clearly, government intervention isn't necessary to displace market leaders in an industry that's seen MySpace, Blackberry, and AOL come and go as dominant players. The free market disciplines industry leaders more quickly and justly than politicians or government bureaucrats can.<br/>However, that hasn't stopped this most recent regulatory iteration from trying again to redefine antitrust policy. The vague, sweeping, and often conflicting gripes and goals of \"hipster antitrust\" advocates don't allow for one cohesive plan. Antitrust regulation cannot both benefit consumers and protect a company's rivals by punishing a tech firm for product innovations and low prices. Gone is the long-held yet crucial U.S. legal standard of consumer harm as the trigger for government intervention. That standard requires proving consumers are getting the short end of the stick, but the new, broader definitions seem to be more about seizing regulatory control of these big tech firms and less about consumer protection.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Inability to prove consumer harm from big tech companies, along with the absence of a cohesive plan for what should replace that standard, should give the House Judiciary Committee, the DOJ, and the FTC pause. Antitrust always has been a malleable tool for politicians and marketplace rivals to exert power over successful businesses. Maybe it's time to make the next incarnation of antitrust an absence of antitrust altogether.<br/>Originally published at Fortune.<br/>Image:\u00a0Experts:\u00a0Jessica MeluginDate:\u00a0Wednesday, July 17, 2019Source:\u00a0FortuneIssues:\u00a0Antitrust and CompetitionTech and TelecomSearch Keywords:\u00a0ANTITRUSTtechantitrust lawMedia appearance type:\u00a0Op-Eds and ArticlesTeaser:\u00a0In its\u00a0second hearing today, the House Judiciary Committee continued its investigation into the tech antitrust issue.

Where fintech is often used to describe solutions endeavouring to fundamentally revolutionise financial services[3], regtech leverages technology to meet complex regulatory obligations more effectively and hereby enhance risk management and strengthen compliance.

[REITs] Q3 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[4] Saxo Bank is deploying new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to our regulatory framework e.g. to enhance financial crime detection procedures and automatically scan through thousands of transactions. Through machine learning, the algorithm is constantly improving and finding new patterns that would be difficult (or time-consuming) to do manually.Why regtech is key to scalability in financial servicesBy Steen Blaafalk, Chief Financial ...sk Officer at Saxo Bank The new era of regulatory requirements triggered by the global financial crisis[5] presents the financial industry with many challenges. Regulation and technology are two of the most important mega-trends that have shifted the tectonic plates of global finance. In the wake of the financial crisis, authorities across the globe have introduced a wave of new, comprehensive and more prudent regulation. Banks must either adapt their operations and ride this wave of new regulation or try to patch together existing systems and workflows. The latter could work from a compliance point of view but the costs will inevitably pile up and create a gridlock for any global organisation. MiFID II, GDPR in Europe and increasing KYC and AML obligations across jurisdictions are just a few examples of what has kept financial institutions busy in recent years. These challenges are in essence why regtech (regulatory technology) has become the new frontier in the financial sector[6]. Where fintech is often used to describe solutions endeavouring to fundamentally revolutionise financial services, regtech leverages technology to meet complex regulatory obligations more effectively and hereby enhance risk management and strengthen compliance. Within a few years, regtech will be an integral part of the value chain from the onboarding process to surveillance of financial crime to regulatory reporting. Not constrained to the financial sector solely, regtech has the potential to greatly impact a variety of industries. Nevertheless, with the financial industry being among the most regulated sectors in the world, this makes for a natural breeding ground for emerging and innovative regtech solutions. Financial institutions that over time fail to utilise technology to engage effectively with increasing regulation neglect the changing environment around them. Attempting to meet the obligations set forth by regulators with manual processes make an organisation prone to human errors and slippage in flows between key functions and departments. In effect, regtech becomes the magic ingredient that enables scalability for financial institutions in an environment of increasing regulatory requirements. At Saxo Bank, we are deploying new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence[7] to our regulatory framework e.g. to enhance financial crime detection procedures and automatically scan through thousands of transactions. Through machine learning, the algorithm is constantly improving and finding new patterns that would be difficult (or time-consuming) to do manually. An important factor for any financial institution with regards to regtech is to collaborate with external partners and vendors. Saxo Bank's regtech framework is built on the foundations of several external data vendors and partners whose systems and knowledge we leverage in our own offering. Digitisation alone cannot solve every regulatory requirement and some processes still need a human hand. Better use of regtech solutions is necessary for any financial institution in order to strengthen the value chain and scale across multiple markets and jurisdictions.

Today it's the fustier crew of competition regulators and policy wonks - more commonly spotted in carpeted conference rooms - who appear to have seized the pulpit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors in Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. will no doubt testify to this shift in power after the threat of U.S. antitrust action caused their shares to fall at the start of this week (Apple's have rallied slightly).</p><p>There was certainly a great show of purpose from the attendees at an OECD trust-buster gathering that I attended in Paris on Monday, helped no doubt by the Americans finally starting to follow Europe's lead in tackling the tech giants' monopolistic tendencies.</p><p>While there's still plenty of tension between officials on both sides of the Atlantic, the overall picture was of a regulatory class that's determined to make up for lost time. Even in Europe, there's a sense of having left too much in the hands of the market for too long.</p><p>Regret is a powerful thing, especially when the political pressure to act is rising. The example of Instagram was frequently referred to as something that flew under everyone's radar: Its sale to Facebook for $1 billion was waved through in 2012, largely because it had a handful of staff, earned no revenue and was to be kept at arm's length. The fact that Instagram is now a behemoth in its own right has woken up regulators to the need to take a tougher line on big tech gobbling up promising startups.</p><p>Instagram had 30 million users at the time Facebook acquired it. Today, it has more than 1 billion. Crucially, Instagram shares vast amounts of user data with its parent network, a practice that drew objections from German regulators earlier this year. Back in 2012, though, there were few concerns: U.K. competition watchdogs wrote at the time that most third parties \"did not believe that photo apps are attractive to advertisers,\" citing the fact that \"limited\" user data was captured.</p><p>In fairness to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, it's not his fault that he had a more acute grasp of Instagram's potential, but this shouldn't stop the market cops from trying to up their game to avoid even more social media power ending up in one man's hands.</p><p>How many other Instagrams have flown under the radar? It's hard to say. Andrea Coscelli, head of the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority, estimates that Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have together bought close to 250 companies in the past five years. For every big-budget acquisition like Facebook's WhatsApp deal, there are several like \"tbh,\" a teen social network bought by Zuckerberg in 2017 and quietly shut down afterwards.</p><p>There's a feeling among regulators that startups aren't really being given the chance to grow and compete - they get bought as soon as they enter Big Tech's \"kill zone\" (where promising potential rivals are simply taken out).</p><p>So should Google, Facebook and the rest expect a concerted antitrust crackdown from the U.S. to match the EU's? Maybe, though at the OECD meeting there wasn't much appetite for aggressive action like breakups. Both the DOJ official Andrew Finch and the FTC's Noah Phillips were at pains to stress that size wasn't bad in itself; but \"big, behaving badly,\" is a problem, Finch said. As such, hefty fines are a more likely outcome.</p><p>While there are plenty of other American voices calling for a revival of the kind of monopoly dismantling seen during the days of John D. Rockefeller, Finch said the current era felt less like the Gilded Age and more like the 1990s and 2000s, when companies used patents to stunt the growth of their rivals. \"These moments tend to work themselves out,\" he told me. Not exactly the kind of tub-thumping in which Elizabeth Warren might engage.</p><p>So the smart money's still on Europe taking the more adventurous and aggressive antitrust measures. But there's no ignoring the shift on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>People want tougher rules, and they will come.</p><p>Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5cf9895fa6f4fimage\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In this Monday, May 20, 2019 photo, a woman uses her mobile at the Facebook office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong.\"</p><p>It's feasible, given the way Facebook's algorithms can reportedly target advertising at users when they feel \"insecure\" and \"worthless\", that the company has somehow figured out how to censor only speech that is intentionally wrong. But even that low threshold seems to have been abandoned in Facebook's relentless quest for freedom of expression.</p><p>Elected politicians are allowed to speak freely on Facebook - which is to say, they're allowed to spend money to buy advertising - even when they and everybody else knows that the ads are wrong, intentionally or otherwise. Lies are an important part of the public discourse, Facebook argues, and by allowing politicians to spread them, it only serves to further democracy.</p><p>\"We don't fact-check political ads,\" Zuckerberg said in his Georgetown address.</p><p>\"We don't do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying. And if content is newsworthy, we also won't take it down even if it would otherwise conflict with many of our standards.\"</p><p>Last week, Twitter took a polar opposite stance and enraged the US President by banning political ads entirely.</p><p>The civil rights activists and causes with which Zuckerberg associates himself also don't see things quite the same way.</p><p>Martin Luther King's daughter, Bernice King, noted that it was political disinformation that \"created an atmosphere\" for her father's assassination, and the civil rights activist Alicia Garza said that, rather than defending black lives, Facebook \"will be remembered as an enabler of white supremacy\".</p><p>As it happens, \"free speech\" isn't the only phrase Facebook has been bandying about in its self-defence against legislators and regulators, who are trying to ensure that events such as Cambridge Analytica and the Christchurch massacre live-streaming do not happen again.</p><p>Facebook executives, visiting Australia in an effort to shape the new regulatory framework that would seek to curb the excesses of Big Tech companies such as Facebook and Google, routinely trot out the word \"innovation\" as something which, like free speech, should itself curb the excesses of any such regulation.</p><p>Facebook is all in favour of regulation, they'll tell you (as they have told me numerous times), as long as it doesn't stand in the way of innovation.</p><p>The two terms, \"free speech\" and \"innovation\", have a lot in common.</p><p>The dark side</p><p>To start with, they're both in the same rhetorical family as the word \"motherhood\". After all, who can argue against free speech/innovation/motherhood, without coming off as a monster?</p><p>Moreover, neither free speech nor innovation are unalloyed goods. They both have a dark side, which Facebook is hoping legislators and regulators will discount when the time comes to draft and enforce new laws.</p><p>You don't have to turn to the wholesale destruction of forests, the pumping of billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air or the disposal of plastic in the ocean - those singularly human innovations that scientists say have us in a new era of mass extinction - to question whether innovation always produces desirable outcomes.</p><p>You only have to look at Big Tech's recent innovations to see that some laws might be worth having, not because they don't get in the way of innovation, but precisely because they do.</p><p>Uber revolutionised the transport industry, to be sure, but arguably its most important innovation, the one that allowed it to offer rides cheaper than taxis, was that it found a way to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/workplace/uber-drivers-not-employees-fair-work-ombudsman-20190607-p51vhb\">use technology to bypass existing labour laws</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/the-uber-lord-giveth-but-drivers-pay-emotional-price-for-its-success-20190417-p51f5w\">pay its drivers less than the minimum wage</url>.</p><p>The company argues that it's not an employer of drivers, but rather just a social media platform that unites drivers with passengers, and as such doesn't have the same financial responsibilities to its drivers that an employer might.</p><p>Facebook's own innovations, of course, are well documented and too numerous to detail here. But the novel role that social media played in mass killings in Sri Lanka and Myanmar; the hitherto unfeasible way Russia meddled with US elections; and the brand-new spectacle of a mass murderer live-streaming his own handiwork - these are all innovations the world could do without.</p><p>To be sure, innovation, like free speech, is part of the solution to the problems that regulators of Big Tech are only now seeking to address.</p><p>But like free speech, it's part of the problem, too. Not all innovation is progress.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520195704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDY-02R1-DY19-C4F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"952\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

We'll be back with you on Monday. Sign up for it here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon.</p><p>Amazon hasn't responded to President Trump's latest tweet about the company, and most likely won't.</p><p>  Mr. Trump's criticisms, though, are largely mistaken. For a long time, Amazon did not pay state sales tax, but it does so now when it sells its own goods in states that collect it. It is the case, however, that in most states Amazon does not collect sales taxes on goods sold by third parties through its platform. As for the United States Postal Service, Amazon's business appears to be giving a welcome lift to its package shipping revenue.</p><p>  Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon's rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.</p><p>  But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.</p><p>Amazon accounts for only 4 percent of all retail sales in the United States, a recent survey estimated. Its revenue is a third of Walmart's and, even after its acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon's footing in the grocery business is still small.</p><p>  All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.</p><p>Amazon also has a loyal customer base -- it has an estimated 90 million Prime members -- and the public views it relatively favorably. When the Department of Justice's antitrust lawyers went after the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&amp;T, it was not targeting companies that were particularly popular with the public.</p><p>  Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That's because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.</p><p>  But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.</p><p>  -- Peter Eavis</p><p>  Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook's board.</p><p>  The investment adviser to New York City's pension funds is calling for changes to Facebook's board to address the fallout from Cambridge Analytica's improper harvesting of information from 50 million users of the social network.</p><p>New York City's comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation:</p><p>  ''Facebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company's business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.''</p><p>New York City's pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook's shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.</p><p>  In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook's independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.</p><p>  Here are the proposed changes:</p><p>  1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board's ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.</p><p>  2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.</p><p>  3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company's data privacy policies and risks.</p><p>  4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can ''recoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.''</p><p>  Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.</p><p>  President Trump spoke out against Amazon on Thursday, saying that the online behemoth does not pay enough taxes and uses the United States postal system ''as their Delivery Boy.''</p><p>  The president's commentary, made in a Twitter post, comes amid reports that Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in reining in the e-commerce business.</p><p>Amazon and the company's founder, Jeff Bezos, are among Mr. Trump's regular Twitter targets. In December, Mr. Trump questioned whether the United States Post Office charges Amazon enough for package deliveries. And in August, Mr. Trump said Amazon hurts taxpaying businesses.</p><p>Amazon, however, does pay taxes -- $412 million in 2016, for instance, according to the company's report to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>  Axios reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump has wondered aloud whether Amazon could be vulnerable to antitrust or competition laws.</p><p>  ''Trump's wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him -- and he agrees -- that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.''</p><p>Amazon shares fell more than 7 percent following that Axios article but recovered some of those losses after a White House official told Reuters that the company faced no particular policy changes. But the administration is always looking at its options, the official added. The stock closed down 4.4 percent Wednesday.</p><p>  Shares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.</p><p>  Should shareholders worry? The GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Bloomberg that this regulatory threat was unlikely to change Amazon's business model, but it was still ''the last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see today.''</p><p>  Retailers, at least, already have some reason to be cheerful.</p><p>  And Amazon has another target market for expansion: housekeeping.</p><p>  First quarter profits are going to be big.</p><p>  Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.</p><p>  Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&amp;P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.</p><p>  Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.</p><p>  But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.</p><p>  That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.</p><p>  That may already be happening. BofAMerrill Lynch's earnings revision ratio for the S.&amp;P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.</p><p>  Are we witnessing the end of a tech boom?</p><p>  Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.</p><p>  Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.</p><p>  Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.</p><p>  Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.</p><p>  Concerns about Tesla's ability to fund itself can also be seen in the trading of its debt.</p><p>  The WSJ's Charley Grant explains:</p><p>Tesla can't simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.</p><p>  Peter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts:</p><p>  After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.</p><p>  And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.</p><p>Barclays pays $2 billion to settle mortgage securities suit.</p><p>Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay $2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages.</p><p>  The Justice Department sued the bank in December 2016 after the two sides failed to reach a settlement despite months of talks. The settlement is the latest by a European lender related to residential mortgage-backed securities sold ahead of the financial crisis and follows agreements reached by Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank in late 2016.</p><p>  ''I am pleased that we have been able to reach a fair and proportionate settlement with the Department of Justice,'' James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, said in a news release. ''It has been a priority for this management team from the start to resolve these historic issues in a timely and appropriate manner wherever possible.''</p><p>  Two former Barclays executives who were sued along with the bank also have reached settlements, agreeing to pay a combined $2 million, the Justice Department said in a news release.</p><p>  Their lawyers separately said the government's claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.</p><p>  - Chad Bray</p><p>Goldman banker to join Morgan Stanley</p><p>  Tammy Kiely is leaving Goldman Sachs to join Morgan Stanley as global head of semiconductor and auto technology investment banking, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.</p><p>  Ms. Kiely, who will be based in Menlo Park, Calif., joined Goldman in 1999 and had headed its semiconductor investment banking team since 2006, becoming a partner in 2014. Before Goldman, she worked at KPMG as a certified public accountant in its information, communications and entertainment practice.</p><p>  She has a bachelor's degree in business administration from the California Polytechnic State University and an M.B.A. from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.</p><p>  Following her arrival, Mark Edelstone will become chairman of global semiconductor investment banking at Morgan Stanley.</p><p>  The move comes amid a wave of dealmaking among chip makers the past few years.</p><p>  - Chad Bray</p><p>  Revolving door</p><p>   Equifax has a new C.E.O.: the former G.E. executive Mark Begor.

Gangadhar has left G.M.'s self-driving car company, Cruise, after six months as chief technology officer. (Recode)</p><p>  More thorny questions over data</p><p>  The Advertising Research Foundation gave Cambridge Analytica an award last year. Amid the scandal over Facebook data, it's thinking again.</p><p>  But the group's executive, Scott McDonald, said that advertisers cared more about whether the data tech companies offered was accurate than whether they should have collected it.</p><p>Facebook, for its part, promised yesterday to stop advertisers targeting ads using data from third-party brokers, and to put its user privacy settings in one place, rather than about 20. It's also rethinking privacy safeguards for forthcoming devices, The Information says.</p><p>  Tim Cook of Apple is calling for privacy regulation: ''To me, it's creepy when I look at something and all of a sudden it's chasing me all across the web.''</p><p>  And our Kevin Roose considers how to save social media: Facebook could become more of a collective enterprise, social networks could become more like email or users could put an expiry date on information.</p><p>  The tech flyaround</p><p>   Expect more deals from SoftBank's Vision Fund. It wants to be the biggest shareholder in 100 tech companies, then consolidate them. It's nearing a deal for a stake in Swiss Re, too.</p><p>   The German automakers BMW and Daimler have teamed up to fight Silicon Valley.

(WSJ)</p><p>  The limits of emergency powers against Chinese money</p><p>  While finalizing its plans for trade restrictions, the Trump administration is moving ahead with a more targeted strike against Chinese investment in sensitive American technology.</p><p>  But the Treasury Department faces a challenge if, as planned, it uses the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.</p><p>  ''Just defining what percentage of equity would classify a firm as 'state-owned' is difficult, as is the definition of which technologies should be off limits,'' the WSJ's Bob Davis writes. ''In some cases, U.S. firms could rely on Chinese ones for innovation, especially in manufacturing.''</p><p>  The political flyaround</p><p>   A lawsuit arguing that President Trump's continued business interests violate the Constitution has passed its first test. (NYT)</p><p>   Republicans' plan for a second tax cut before the midterm elections has yet to attract much financial support from business.

Greenberg, one of Morgan Stanley's top financial advisers.</p><p>  Executives at the bank knew about his behavior, former employees said, but no action was taken until the NYT raised the issue this week.</p><p>  The bank's wealth-management division accounts for nearly half Morgan Stanley's revenue and is seen as its prime source of future profits.</p><p>  Why Japanese companies love overseas deals</p><p>  With an aging and declining population in Japan, companies have to look elsewhere to grow. Takeda Pharmaceuticals' potential bid for Shire could be one of the largest acquisitions ever of a Western company by a Japanese buyer.</p><p>  Critics' corner: It's not really about cost savings, argues Bloomberg Gadfly's Chris Hughes: ''In reality, the attraction is that Shire is cheap and vulnerable -- something other bidders will see.'' And the FT's Lex would welcome that: ''There are better potential matches.''</p><p>AT&amp;T-Time Warner trial update: The head of Turner broadcasting said that his company's channels would not be used as a weapon against rivals if the deal went through. The judge overseeing the case told the parties to speed up their presentation. And if the deal isn't completed by Apr. 22, it may cost AT&amp;T  up to $1.1 billion in special redemptions.</p><p>  The deals flyaround</p><p>   Concho Resources will buy RSP Permian for $9.5 billion, creating a shale-oil colossus and adding to the rush to produce more oil.

After having spent $50 billion in building a scalable, state of the art wireless network, Mukesh Ambani realized that he needed strategic investors like Facebook, Google and Qualcomm to build a unique ecosystem of content, services, apps and platforms. In my opinion Mukesh Ambani will go down in history in the same league of seismic socio-economic transformational agents in Indian history as Lord Buddha, Emperor Akbar, Robert Clive, M. K. Gandhi and JRD Tata.         Reliance has focused on the hottest embryonic themes in India\u2019s digital constellation \u2013 IOT, blockchain, edge computing, mobile wallets, payment networks, AR/virtual reality, education, healthcare, retail, media/entertainment, music streaming, Nextgen e-commerce, e-Bollywood, gaming and so much more.         In India, a nation of 1.3 billion human beings, will have no choice but to access this digital octopus, a defacto economic monopoly since Vodafone, Bharti Airtel has no hope of ever competing with Reliance Jio, I can easily envisage a $150 billion market cap on the NASDAQ in the next two years. This means that investors who accumulated the shares at $64 billion in last week\u2019s financing round will almost triple their money when the IPO breaks syndicate some time in 2022. It is no coincidence that the private equity financiers who led the round included KKR, General Atalantic, Vista and Silverlake, among the most respected names in technology finance.         The digital transformation of India will be one of the worlds\u2019 most exciting themes in the next decade and Reliance Jio is the obvious proxy for this theme. This is why I believe the Reliance Jio IPO will be a historic moment in the Big Tech sector, in the same league as the fabulously profitable IPOs of Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Alibaba. Hence the reason I went gaga on this investment opportunity, even though so many of my Indian friends are skeptical about private equity deals in Bharat Mata, given their bitter past experience. Yet comparing Reliance Jio to any other dodgy Indian stock promoter is like comparing the Kohinoor diamond (Yo, Queen Liz, we want it back. The House of Windsor should not hoard goods stolen from Maharaja Ranjit Singh\u2019s teenage son way back when) to a lump of worthless coal.         Note that Reliance Industries shares have doubled since March to almost Rs 1950 on the Bombay Stock Exchange even though India has crossed one million COVID cases and Moody\u2019s has downgraded India\u2019s sovereign credit rating to Baa3, one notch above sovereign junk.         Mukesh Ambani believes that Reliance Jio is a potential $1 trillion business as India\u2019s preeminent digital services champion and I do not believe he is smoking anything weird in his philosopher\u2019s pipe. He built India\u2019s biggest wireless network in only 3 years even though Dalal Street scoffed at his debt accumulation spree and digital fantasies. This is the reason Reliance Industries shares were dead money earlier in the decade.         Jio\u2019s network infrastructure is both scalable and resilient. Its architecture will enable a dramatic drop in operating cost and an exponential rise in wireless broadband data usage. At $64 billion, I believe that Jio has given a gift to Wall Street since downside risk is near zero while upside potential is at least a five bagger. It is not often in life that an investor gets a chance to invest in a unique digital business with zero downside risk and five to ten times upside potential. I remember recommending Google and Tesla at their respective IPOs in my media columns and I am even more bullish in the long term prospects of Jio. Lest I be accused of home country bias, let me disclose, I would like to point out that I was born on the other side of Sir Cyril Radcliffe\u2019s award that partitioned the subcontinent.         India will soon become a tale of two Modis \u2013 While Narendra has destroyed billions in economic value, Manoj will create hundreds of billions in shareholder value.         Jio is India\u2019s Netflix, WhatsApp, Youtube, Zoom, Google, Spotify, WeChat, Amazon, PayPay, Alibaba, Verizon and Comcast in package. This puppy will be the mother of all digital money making opportunities in India and make Mukesh Ambani possibly the wealthiest man on earth.         Reliance Jio is in a class of its own because its pricing last week was just so ridiculously cheap. I sense Mukesh Ambani just wanted to ensure that the best and brightest of Wall Street validated his revolutionary vision (\u201cdata is the new oil\u201d), which he articulated as far back as 2003 when I spent a month in my family\u2019s ancestral roots in Mumbai.         Jio\u2019s subscriber base is 388 million even now but this is only the tip of the iceberg and the runway for growth is a blowout. The biggest risk in Reliance Jio? India\u2019s political and regulatory climate could shift against the Ambani clan. Jio could make execution missteps yet I passionately believe that the biggest risk in Jio is not owning its shares as this will be the investment journey of a lifetime. That much, at least, is certain.

For that matter, in races nationwide in which the projected winning margins are small-say, under 5 percent or so-Republicans, in general, are likely to lose.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's because of new forces of influence that the internet has made possible in recent decades and that Big Tech companies-Google more aggressively than any other-have been determined to perfect since Armageddon Day-oh, sorry, Election Day-in 2016.</p><p>For the record, I'm neither a conservative nor a Trump supporter. But I love democracy and America more than I love any particular party or candidate, and rigorous research that I have been conducting since 2013 shows that Big Tech companies now have unprecedented power to sway elections.</p><p>While I cheer the fact that 95 percent of donations from tech companies and their employees go to Democrats, I can't stand by and watch these companies undermine democracy. As long as I'm still breathing, I will do everything I can to stop that from happening-and, for the record, I'm NOT suicidal.</p><p>The threat these companies pose is far from trivial. For one thing, they can shift opinions and votes in numerous ways that people can't detect.</p><p>Remember the rumors about that movie theater in New Jersey that got people to buy more Coke and popcorn using subliminal messages embedded into a film? Well, those rumors were a bit exaggerated-those messages actually had a minimal effect-but Google-andthe-Gang are now controlling a wide variety of subliminal methods of persuasion that can, in minutes, shift the voting preferences of 20 percent or more of undecided voters without anyone having the slightest idea they've been manipulated.</p><p>Worse still, they can use these techniques without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace. In a leak of Google emails to the Wall Street Journal in 2018, one Googler asks his colleagues how the company can use \"ephemeral experiences\" to change people's views about Trump's travel ban.</p><p>Ephemeral experiences are those fleeting ones we have every day when we view online content that's generated onthe-fly and isn't stored anywhere: newsfeeds, search suggestions, search results, and so on. No authority can go back in time to see what search suggestions or search results you were shown, but dozens of randomized, controlled, doubleblind experiments I've conducted show that such content can dramatically shift opinions and voting preferences. See the problem?</p><p>Speaking of content, I'm getting sick of seeing headlines about Russian interference in our elections. Unless the Russians suddenly figure out how to massively hack our voting machines- and shame on us if we're incompetent enough to let that happen-there's no evidence that bad actors such as Russia or the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica can shift more than a few thousand votes here and there. Generally speaking, all they can do is throw some biased content onto the internet. But content isn't the problem anymore.</p><p>All that matters now is who has the power to decide what content people will see or will not see (censorship), and what order that content is presented in. That power is almost entirely in the hands of the arrogant executives at two U.S. companies. Their algorithms decide which content gets suppressed, the order in which content is shown, and which content goes viral. You can counter a TV ad with another TV ad, but if the tech execs are supporting one candidate or party, you can't counteract their manipulations.</p><p>Forget the Russians. As I said when I testified before Congress last summer, if our own tech companies all favor the same presidential candidate this year- and that seems likely-I calculate that they can easily shift 15 million votes to that candidate without people knowing and without leaving a paper trail.</p><p>By the way, the more you know about someone, the easier it is to manipulate him or her. Google and Facebook have millions of pieces of information about every American voter, and they will be targeting their manipulations at the individual level for every single voter in every swing state. No one in the world except Google and Facebook can do that.</p><p>In President Eisenhower's famous 1961 farewell address, he warned not only about the rise of a military-industrial complex; he also warned about the rise of a \"technological elite\" who could someday control our country without us knowing.</p><p>That day has come, my friends, and it's too late for any law or regulation to make a difference-at least in the upcoming election. There's only one way at this point to get these companies to take their digits off the scale, and that's to do to them what they do to us and our children every day: monitor them aggressively.</p><p>We need to look over the shoulders of a diverse group of thousands of American voters-with their permission, of course-to aggregate and measure the ephemeral content that Google-and-theGang are showing them every day. When bias is detected that has the potential to shift votes, it needs to be reported immediately to the media, the Federal Election Commission, members of Congress, and other authorities. That will force the tech execs to back off; if they don't, they'll be risking humiliation, fines, and, quite possibly, criminal prosecution.</p><p>I'm building such a system now-a greatly expanded version of the monitoring systems I deployed in 2016 and 2018. If you value democracy, wish me luck, or, better yet, lend your support.</p><p>Robert Epstein, a former editor-in-chief of Psychology Today, is senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology.

(That's a relief to us poor tech writers, tired of endlessly explaining ridesharing to baffled relatives in far-flung suburbs.)</p><p><br/> Some might say ridesharing has successfully disrupted the status quo \u2014 insert obligatory eye roll here. Certain\u00a0aspects of that disruption have been covered far more extensively than others. The impact on taxis, of course. The state laws, shifting creakily to encompass this new industry that seemingly emerged from Silicon Valley overnight. Background checks, and safety precautions, and insurance.<br/> But ridesharing also 'disrupts' a few things that we've heard far less about. These\u00a0companies haven't said much about their effects \u2014 positive or detrimental \u2014 on public transit or the environment.\u00a0They've largely stayed mum on the issue.<br/> When these issues are brought up, by advocates[1] or opinion writers[2]\u00a0or even by Lyft, Sidecar, or Uber's local[3] branches, the general consensus tends to be that of course ridesharing will help the environment \u2014 it will take cars off the road by encouraging people to share. These sentiments[4] are only compounded[5] by the introduction[6] of the new carpooling services.<br/> Is that really the case? Since\u00a0they have made it so convenient to get from one place to another, it's\u00a0possible that Uber and Lyft have\u00a0actually increased the number of cars on the road, upped greenhouse gas emissions, and, for some segments of the population, replaced public transportation. I, for one, stopped using unreliable San Francisco buses altogether once these startups\u00a0cut their costs. Furthermore, since Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar are regulated differently in California, the vehicles used by their drivers aren't required to meet low emission standards the way taxis are in San Francisco.<br/> Last Thursday, the issue came to a head\u00a0as the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) released numbers\u00a0that show taxi rides have declined by more than 50 percent[7]\u00a0in the last few\u00a0years.\u00a0Kate Toran, who is running the\u00a0Taxis and Accessible Services branch of the SFMTA, told the board that ridesharing's effects\u00a0can't be fully assessed without numbers from the companies. She's asking the\u00a0California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar, to do a study on their effects. The city needs the data to\u00a0adapt its transportation planning accordingly.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4521616274/in/photolist-7TysZh-8n5Twv-cK5oiN-dtZ29T-86daiY-f8uo3A-75XxbX-9s53gu-88C2Rz-9hLXEP-edpdsp-86dcfo-8kVatx-8n8QP1-byKRfi-8ieR4h-8QC6mR-dt67fv-cLXx1L-7A5gQd-e7ERWQ-8E3rvU-9TdxdD-dNm1KL-dCHA7c-e8FeHZ-aADsHm-c9BtzG-jhRPb8-9s25pM-ahRYPL-9s537N-dUrpbJ-9s24UR-9SD59n-83x9LG-7HwEnU-8igtov-9s24vH-dCC2d7-7bcEfJ-9abXqc-bcoDB8-dyXHmy-8t8Nz1-8pqsNw-89RSNP-91ZxAL-dAFSxy-75xELy/\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4521616274/in/photolist-7TysZh-8n5Twv-cK5oiN-dtZ29T-86daiY-f8uo3A-75XxbX-9s53gu-88C2Rz-9hLXEP-edpdsp-86dcfo-8kVatx-8n8QP1-byKRfi-8ieR4h-8QC6mR-dt67fv-cLXx1L-7A5gQd-e7ERWQ-8E3rvU-9TdxdD-dNm1KL-dCHA7c-e8FeHZ-aADsHm-c9BtzG-jhRPb8-9s25pM-ahRYPL-9s537N-dUrpbJ-9s24UR-9SD59n-83x9LG-7HwEnU-8igtov-9s24vH-dCC2d7-7bcEfJ-9abXqc-bcoDB8-dyXHmy-8t8Nz1-8pqsNw-89RSNP-91ZxAL-dAFSxy-75xELy/</url> Data visualization of the Muni system ; Courtesy: Flickr / Eric Fischer<br/> A rainbow nation of ridesharing<br/>It's worth noting here that public transit options, car ownership statistics, and regulations vary dramatically from urban to suburban to rural areas and between countries. Since it's too complicated to explore the issue nationally, I focused\u00a0on the San Francisco Bay Area, in the hopes that it could provide a glimpse, albeit not national gospel, of what cities will face as ridesharing expands.<br/> I spoke with Bay Area city planners and researchers to try to figure it out.\u00a0Turns out, they're just as baffled and stuck in the dark as the rest of us. Because ridesharing companies won't release their data \u2014 about fleet size, membership size, average trip length, main pick up and drop off spots, vehicle types with average miles and emissions, and other stats \u2014 these experts are stuck cobbling together their best guesses as to what's happening. In San Francisco, the public transit agency runs the taxi system, so it's able to conduct any research it might need to do on taxis. Ridesharing companies, however, are out of its jurisdiction.<br/> Note:\u00a0When I say ridesharing, I'm not referring Zipcar,\u00a0RelayRides, traditional carpooling, or the like. I'm specifically talking about the urban point-to-point rides where you order a car via an app, using\u00a0technology companies like Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar.<br/> These companies have raised hundreds of millions in investment money to expand\u00a0in over a hundred markets\u00a0in the United States alone, and their impact can't be ignored.<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/48722974@N07/4478993066/in/photolist-7PN1Ao-6bRqzY-5vKQFy-dSYMuf-dFZiox-nBnuMy-m4i1Xp-nzXrfi-nAbCjW-nivdFb-9FcCYW-cmJa3q-nj95Ma-anKT8R-niuvMj-nziE1W-8o99Zn-njgvvN-niFf5K-njfwed-nAa9ax-nAvG9Q-nja4ZC-nBnc8q-nBnnrm-nzVBxA-5WwVkA-7BrTaB-8nFfC6-nBn7iX-nDnabr-4NtWYu-nCfACr-njRywC-niycSy-njQs9w-njQe2D-8HJ1sF-7rzQ29-njRemK-fJZKxp-nBjcox-nzQr6v-nBPSAk-njR355-i17R-f5m4Qo-8fkrDy-dNnBSo-bNVik8\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/48722974@N07/4478993066/in/photolist-7PN1Ao-6bRqzY-5vKQFy-dSYMuf-dFZiox-nBnuMy-m4i1Xp-nzXrfi-nAbCjW-nivdFb-9FcCYW-cmJa3q-nj95Ma-anKT8R-niuvMj-nziE1W-8o99Zn-njgvvN-niFf5K-njfwed-nAa9ax-nAvG9Q-nja4ZC-nBnc8q-nBnnrm-nzVBxA-5WwVkA-7BrTaB-8nFfC6-nBn7iX-nDnabr-4NtWYu-nCfACr-njRywC-niycSy-njQs9w-njQe2D-8HJ1sF-7rzQ29-njRemK-fJZKxp-nBjcox-nzQr6v-nBPSAk-njR355-i17R-f5m4Qo-8fkrDy-dNnBSo-bNVik8</url>flickr / eutrophicationhypoxia<br/> Bracing for the worst, but\u00a0expecting the best<br/>The SFMTA has asked for customer demographic numbers, but Lyft and Uber\u00a0have declined. 'Ideally, in the sharing economy, they share things,' Tim Papandreou, director of strategic planning at the SFMTA, told me, laughing. 'So hopefully they'll start sharing their data with us.'<br/> For the SFMTA, the need for numbers is particularly dire. Think about all the new startup services the local city government has to account for in its transportation and transit planning: Delivery cars from Caviar, SpoonRocket, Munchery and Sprig. Drivers from Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar. Google Express delivery. Not to mention the big tech commuter buses and - in the future - Google's driverless cars. 'The Amazon Prime air drones \u2014 where are they going to land?' Papandreou said. 'We think about everything.'<br/> But without data, they can't prepare for the shift.<br/> If Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar\u00a0draw people away from the Muni, buses, BART, and taxis, San Francisco will have to change public transit supply to match the decreased demand. That in turn could make the system even less reliable, and people with higher incomes might\u00a0reject it altogether. 'Public transit [could become]\u00a0a last choice option, and then we have social class segregation, which would be horrible,' Papandreau postulated. 'This is why I can't sleep at night. So many things to think about.'<br/> In some ways, ridesharing companies'\u00a0reluctance to work with the SFMTA is\u00a0confusing. My colleague\u00a0Katie Fehrenbacher\u00a0pointed out that if\u00a0these startups are reducing emissions, that's good publicity for them and something they should embrace. But since they're\u00a0scaling at such a rapid rate \u2014 and cutthroat level of competition \u2014 this is probably\u00a0the least of their concerns at the moment.<br/> I reached out to all three ridesharing companies to\u00a0find out why they won't release their numbers, but only Lyft responded. Paige Thelen, a Lyft spokesperson, told me that ridesharing's\u00a0impact on the environment\u00a0is 'absolutely' something the startup cares about. She would not, however, confirm or deny whether Lyft has refused requests from researchers and the SFMTA to release company data.<br/> 'Lyft has only been around for two years,' Thelen said.\u00a0'It's only in the last few months that we've reached the scale that would make\u00a0transportation\u00a0research\u00a0studies meaningful.' The company has partnerships with the National League of Cities[8] and the federal\u00a0Transportation Research Board[9] to document the impact of ridesharing on cities, although no studies are in the works yet.<br/> At least anecdotally, it appears Uber, Sidecar, and\u00a0Lyft's proliferation has been a good thing for the city. Since the population of San Francisco is growing so rapidly, the public transit system has been overwhelmed. Ridesharing\u00a0seems to have helped lighten the new load \u2014 'seem,' 'appear' and 'anecdotally' being the operative words, since we don't have actual numbers.<br/> The SFMTA has been bracing itself for traffic jams since new residents flooded the city in the tech gold rush. But only twelve percent of the new households[10] coming in\u00a0\u2014 as measured via unit construction \u2014 are purchasing their own vehicles, which is far less\u00a0than expected. It's possible that Lyft and Uber, combined with with public transit, bike sharing, and other options, have made it easier for people to get around without their own cars.<br/> 'Something good is happening,' Papandreau said. 'It hasn't collapsed like it was supposed to with all these new people coming in.'<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/marko8904/2410561540/in/photolist-4F1KXS-4EWvF6-5ieNt7-wRWJF-5PgHdj-wRYVA-4rjVKv-4rjVCP-4rjVzt-4SCU1X-7PN1Ao-6bRqzY-5vKQFy-dSYMuf-dFZiox-nBnuMy-m4i1Xp-nzXrfi-nAbCjW-nivdFb-9FcCYW-cmJa3q-nj95Ma-anKT8R-niuvMj-nziE1W-8o99Zn-njgvvN-niFf5K-njfwed-nAa9ax-nAvG9Q-nja4ZC-nBnc8q-nBnnrm-nzVBxA-5WwVkA-7BrTaB-8nFfC6-nBn7iX-nDnabr-4NtWYu-nCfACr-njRywC-niycSy-njQs9w-njQe2D-8HJ1sF-7rzQ29-njRemK\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/marko8904/2410561540/in/photolist-4F1KXS-4EWvF6-5ieNt7-wRWJF-5PgHdj-wRYVA-4rjVKv-4rjVCP-4rjVzt-4SCU1X-7PN1Ao-6bRqzY-5vKQFy-dSYMuf-dFZiox-nBnuMy-m4i1Xp-nzXrfi-nAbCjW-nivdFb-9FcCYW-cmJa3q-nj95Ma-anKT8R-niuvMj-nziE1W-8o99Zn-njgvvN-niFf5K-njfwed-nAa9ax-nAvG9Q-nja4ZC-nBnc8q-nBnnrm-nzVBxA-5WwVkA-7BrTaB-8nFfC6-nBn7iX-nDnabr-4NtWYu-nCfACr-njRywC-niycSy-njQs9w-njQe2D-8HJ1sF-7rzQ29-njRemK</url> Community art project in Toronto, Canada; Courtesy: Flickr / marko8904<br/> Doing what\u00a0we can with the data we have<br/>Transportation researchers have been as eager as city government to understand ridesharing's impact on the city. But they've hit the same wall - Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar won't share their customer information. Certain details about their businesses could be used by their rivals against them, either in marketing efforts or recruitment tactics.<br/> Dr. Susan Shaheen[11] from UC Berkeley's\u00a0Transportation Center[12] applied for a grant to survey ridesharing passengers, and initially, two companies (whose identities she wouldn't disclose) agreed to take part and share their details. But by the time Shaheen secured funding for the project months later, the ridesharing climate had become much more competitive and the operators backed out.<br/> 'It's not too surprising,' Dr. Shaheen told me. 'There's uncertainty as to what these results would've unveiled.'<br/> Instead, the Berkeley team was stuck cobbling together a less rigorous study.\u00a0They surveyed 380 people on the street at ridesharing 'hot spots'[13] in San Francisco like North Beach, the Marina, and the Mission. As you might imagine, such an approach comes with its share of drawbacks. These hot spots are likely to include a higher percentage of people out partying and bar-hopping, as opposed to commuters or errand runners. The demographics will skew young.<br/> Nevertheless, if the\u00a0companies won't release\u00a0their own data, this type of study is the only\u00a0way\u00a0to understand what's going on. The primary\u00a0conclusion was that ridesharing both complements and competes with public transit. For example, of the people surveyed, four percent of them were taking a rideshare to or from other public transit options like the CalTrain. 'It was interesting, because we weren't even intercepting people at those locations,' Shaheen said. 'It was just showing up in the data of the last trip people took.' But at the same time, 33 percent of respondents said they used ridesharing on their last trip as a replacement for public transportation.<br/> This isn't particularly profound stuff, but Tim Papandreau at the SFMTA was excited to receive it. It gave him at least some numbers-backed insight into ridesharing's clientele.<br/>Pink mustaches and the planet<br/>The study, by proxy, offered\u00a0insight into\u00a0ridesharing and the environment. Of the people surveyed who own cars, 40 percent said they drive less because of ridesharing. In California, forty percent of carbon emissions in the state[14]\u00a0come from transportation, which includes personal driving along with freight transportation, public transit, aviation, and agricultural transportation. The number one determinant of how much someone drives is (shocker!) whether he or she owns a car. Without their own cars, people are more likely to walk to where they need to go.<br/> Some environmentalists are, as a result, enthused about Uber,\u00a0Lyft, and Sidecar, since on the surface it seems as if their existence makes it easier to live in the city without a car. Amanda Eaken[15], a deputy director with the Natural Resources Defense Council, is optimistic about ridesharing for exactly that reason. 'One of the ways we think about it is anything that gets people out of individual cars is part of the solution,' Eaken told me.<br/> Of\u00a0course, ridesharing might make it easier for people to live in the city without owning a car, but ridesharing itself involves vehicle travel. So, its impact on greenhouse gas emissions is complicated to assess. 'It's too early to tell,' Eaken concluded. She did admit that she has met with Lyft - at the company's request - to discuss environmental issues.<br/> We may not know the numbers, but what\u00a0we do know is that these Silicon Valley darlings are growing bigger by the day, and they're not\u00a0sticking with their original proposition or staying only in America. Uber has shown signs of moving into delivery and logistics \u2014 not to mention aviation. Look out UPS and Fedex. Lyft has pioneered the new carpooling model that \u2014 at half the price \u2014 could bring even more passengers into the system. These organizations are in the early stages of transforming transportation and they have massive warchests of capital to take that effort all around the world.<br/> Since they're not controlled by a medallion system, there's hypothetically an unlimited number of drivers who could take to the roads. The growth potential is huge and the ramifications unknown.<br/> Are the roads going to fill up and public transit empty out? Will our air get cleaner as we all give up our own cars and take Ubers instead?\u00a0It's like an 800 page thriller.

There's no way he would have Google Home or the equivalent in his home, he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Why do I want a device listening to everything I say?\" he declared this week, as he continued his campaign against the invasion of personal privacy perpetrated by digital platforms. \"If people want to have these devices in their homes ... they need to know in really clear terms which they don't now ... how much information is going back to home base, what exactly is being done with it and who it is going to.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That sort of sentiment is ricocheting around the global tech world after so many years of governments and consumers neither knowing nor caring what and how their information was being used. The amorphous concept of big data suddenly seems very personal - everywhere.</p><p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission action is expected to challenge Facebook over potential breaches of consumer law by allowing users' data to be shared with third parties, and Google over whether it has unlawfully collated people's locations and that other data it sucks up.</p><p>But it's not only the ACCC taking aim at tech giants via imminent legal action over breaches of privacy, competition and consumer laws. And it's the combined effect of big government players against big tech that is the only real chance of forcing change after consumers happily traded away their privacy in exchange for convenience over recent years.</p><p>Much of this trade-off may have been unwitting - given the ignorance of most people about the rapid advance of technology's ability to acquire, refine and reuse personal information. It's still an open question whether most people would turn off their gadgets and restrict access to their personal histories and preferences at the risk of impeding that ease of connection.</p><p>I still find it tempting to ask Alexa - unable to see what possible use my mundane conversations could be to the AI god in the sky. But I am becoming more uneasy about how every single habit of mine is now tracked and recorded. And increasingly, governments and regulators in Western countries are deciding this is not an issue to be left only to big tech and individuals to negotiate - or just accept on a take it or leave it basis.</p><p>It's also another example of the growing divide between Chinese big tech and the West given the widespread use of technology to reward and punish behaviour in China and the split over use of Huawei's telco equipment services.</p><p>So the European Union is expected to launch action under the EU's new privacy laws by the end of 2019, with billions of euros in fines expected but more importantly new orders requiring changes to business practices.</p><p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission leads EU privacy enforcement for Facebook because the company is headquartered there and has opened 11 cases under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Get used to the acronym. Europe led the way on the crackdown on tech giants over privacy concerns. Ireland will soon send its draft decisions on proposed sanctions to the EU's other privacy regulators for consultation.</p><p>But it's the US, the country that spawned the most powerful and successful corporations of the modern era, also putting intense - if belated - pressure on its tech giants. This is likely to have even greater impact on the way technology interacts with people's lives.</p><p>It also goes well beyond the $US5 billion ($7.4 billion) fine imposed on Facebook by the US Federal Trade Commission - the size of which could almost be written off as the cost of doing business for a company with such massive reach and revenue.</p><p>So far, there's little evidence of general political enthusiasm for the idea of forced break-up or divestment of tech giants beyond calls by Democrat candidate Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>But the Justice Department has just opened a broad anti-trust review into whether big technology companies unlawfully stifle competition, compounding the range of new threats for Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple from US regulators and other government agencies.</p><p>The latest review will examine online platforms that dominate internet search, social media and retail services.</p><p>This adds to a two-pronged effort by the FTC and the Justice Department - which share responsibility for anti-trust enforcement - against companies that have come to symbolise the ability of the US economy to constantly recreate itself.</p><p>Just like Australia, the US focus is on finding new ways to control companies that have proven so beyond the control of traditional rules and legal concepts.</p><p>Nor is this confined to federal efforts - with liberal California taking the lead among US states despite the political and economic and innovative power of Silicon Valley.</p><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act will take effect next year and widens the definition of personal information. California residents will have the right to prohibit sale of their personal data to others and to opt out of sharing it altogether. Several other states are now adopting their own versions of this.</p><p>California has also enforced a much stricter \"net neutrality\" law. This stops internet service providers from blocking or slowing down websites and apps or being paid to speed up a service. The Federal Communications Commission had adopted such rules under the Obama administration but they were abolished under Donald Trump, leaving some Democratic states to step in.</p><p>Last May, San Francisco also became the first American city to ban facial recognition technology by its law enforcement agencies. This too has prompted similar legislation elsewhere. In some ways, the US was slower than Europe and Australia to react to the power of big tech. But it's certainly moving now. Silicon Valley will have to respond.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc76o74o4izjl1a8z9yeaj</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTN-GPH1-F0J6-J32M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"962\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

For the rest of you laggards, entries close at 8AM ET on Tuesday. Please take a couple minutes and let me know how I can improve this for you!</p><p>When last we left off, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had shocked the world by revealing an extortion plot against him involving some intimate photos, a tabloid, and one or more nation states. Over the weekend, we mostly waited for the next set of shoes to drop. For the most part, we're still waiting   but a handful of developments have nudged the story forward. (And if you need an explainer on the whole story, start here.)</p><p>In the New York Times, Jim Rutenberg, Karen Weise and William K. Rashbaum report that federal prosecutors are reviewing the extortion claims. The owner of the National Enquirer, which apparently attempted to buy Bezos' silence about the political motivations of a previous leak of his intimate text messages, is scrambling in response:</p><p>If American Media is found to have broken a law   any law   it would be in violation of a deal with federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York. The agreement was struck in September after American Media admitted paying hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to protect Donald J. Trump from allegations of an affair. Under the deal, the company would not be prosecuted for its Trump-related efforts as long as it stayed out of legal trouble for the next three years.</p><p>Even as American Media fell into legal jeopardy last year, its board stood by the company's chairman, David J. Pecker, and its top news executive, Dylan Howard. On Friday, however, the company announced that the board was starting an investigation of Mr. Bezos' claims.</p><p>(Here's AMI's full statement on the subject.)</p><p>So, to review, there are two mystery leaks at the heart of the Bezos story: one leak of his text messages, and another leak of his photos. It remains unclear whether, or how, they may be related.</p><p>On Sunday, The Daily Beast fingered Michael Sanchez, the brother of Jeff Bezos' girlfriend, as the source of the text message leak:</p><p>Documents reviewed by The Daily Beast show that Michael Sanchez believed the Enquirer pursued its story about Bezos with  President Trump's knowledge and appreciation  a chase encouraged, in Sanchez's estimation, by Republican operatives  who THINK Jeff gets up every morning and has a WaPo meeting to plot its next diabolical attack on President Trump. </p><p>No one who spoke to The Daily Beast implied that Michael Sanchez in any way hacked his sister's phone, and he has not been charged with any crime. In fact, three people familiar with the Bezos-funded probe told The Daily Beast in late January that it had found no evidence of a hack. However, Bezos' investigators have strongly suspected Sanchez was the leaker since at least last week, according to two people familiar with the investigation.

He concludes that it was most likely Saudi Arabia, not agents of the United States government, that intercepted Bezos' messages:  MBS had both the means and the motive to target Bezos. The extramarital affair   and MBS's relationship with David Pecker   may have given him the opportunity.  (An earlier el-Baghdadi thread describes the relationship between Pecker, AMI, and Saudi Arabia in good detail.)</p><p>Bezos tiptoes right up to saying this himself in his original Medium post, in which he writes:  The Post's essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder of its columnist Jamal Khashoggi is undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles. </p><p>To be sure, el-Baghdadi 's threads involve a healthy dose of speculation. And AMI has denied that the Saudis were involved.

Here is a profile of Gavin de Becker, Bezos' security chief. Here is a profile of Jon Fine, a longtime former Amazon lawyer who is now representing AMI against his old boss.

In September, the Internet Association said it supported  preempting state consumer privacy and data security laws  so the rules are  consistent  nationwide.</p><p>But the hasty adoption of California's 24-page privacy law has left many issues unresolved. Some provisions, for example, say both consumers and households can request access to their data   a seemingly minor discrepancy that could open the door for privacy pitfalls, such as roommates or family members seeing information they should not be able to access.

They can flood the information space with false, distracting or irrelevant information so that people have trouble understanding what is real and what is fake.</p><p>Alternatively, they can use those same robotic tools, fake accounts and dedicated teams to troll individuals with hateful commentary or smears that make them afraid to speak, or difficult to be heard or believed. In the new information world, these are the real threats, both to free speech and to civilized public discourse   even to democracy itself. If we can't have a public debate because the information space is so polluted, or because people are afraid of the reactions of organized trolls, then we can't really have meaningful elections anymore, either.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">An Open Letter to Facebook from the Mozilla Foundation</emphasis></p><p>The makers of the Firefox browser tell Facebook to accelerate its efforts to protect the platform during elections.

It provides an excellent history of Section 230, the legal foundation of social media. That might sound boring, but Kosseff makes it work by mixing stories and analysis without vitiating either. I agree with Kosseff that, problems notwithstanding, the benefits of Section 230 have outweighed its costs. </p><p>Given that, I don't look forward to future editions of his book since they may document the 'fall' of Section 230. In other words, the law is likely to be amended to limit the protections offered internet platforms. We have already seen changes meant to combat sex trafficking. Section 230's most serious persistent vulnerability, however, comes from a mismatch between its statutory language and the larger world the law inhabits. Our political world is divided between (let's call them) Progressives and Conservatives. Progressives see society as a struggle between designated oppressor and oppressed groups. No one - not government, not the tech companies - should be neutral between these groups; everyone should favor the oppressed. Since the speech of oppressors is causally essential to the harms experienced by the oppressed, government and the platforms should suppress that speech to help the oppressed. Remember, no one is neutral in this endless struggle. As it happens, given the extent of Progressive cultural authority, the language of Section 230 favors the Progressive cause. Here's an edited version of Section 230(c)(2)[2] that clarifies this point: No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to beobjectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected[emphasis added] So if content moderators think speech offending the oppressed is 'objectionable,' they can banish it from their service. Conservatives say Section 230 demands political neutrality. They are clearly wrong about the statutory language. However, their claim might be interpreted more broadly. Progressives believe some online speech should be suppressed. The companies may do so under Section 230(c)(2). But the Conservative demand for neutrality may be another way of saying our political world is evenly divided between Progressives and Conservatives. What would happen if the platforms tried to suppress a great deal of speech by half of the population? We need a solution here that recognizes the platforms' right to moderate content must be carried out absent political animus . For Conservatives, that would mean Alex Jones comes down but Charles Murray stays up, as it were. Conservatives may not have much faith in this solution. They might see a slippery slope whose zenith is Alex Jones and whose nadir is Charles Murray. (That may explain conservatives' odd embrace of Alex Jones as a conservative[3]). Indeed, it is not unreasonable to think Murray's treatment at Middlebury[4] might be repeated figuratively online. In that light, government regulation of the platforms seems a reasonable solution to reasonable fears. But it is not. We have a First Amendment because we do not trust the government to regulate speech. But now our distrust of each other (including distrust of the owners of the platforms) points many people back to government regulation of online speech and of private content moderation. Conservatives are coming around to the idea that the government that cannot be trusted to regulate campaign finance somehow will assure a fair online political debate. Count me skeptical on both points. For me, that turn toward government may spoil Kosseff's future history of Section 230. After all, like most readers, I prefer a happy ending, especially for liberal values.

The Department of Justice held a workshop Wednesday: Section 230 - Nurturing Innovation or Fostering Unaccountability? (archived video[1] and agenda[2]). This was perhaps the most official 'Airing of Grievances' we've had yet about Section 230[3]. It signals that the Trump administration has declared war on the law that made the Internet possible[4]. In a blistering speech[5], Trump's embattled Attorney General, Bill Barr, blamed the 1996 law for a host of ills, especially the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). That proved a major topic of discussion among panelists. Writing in Techdirt three weeks ago, TechFreedom's Berin Sz\u00f3ka analyzed[6] draft legislation that would use Section 230 to force tech companies to build in backdoors for the U.S. government in the name of stopping CSAM \u2014 and predicted that Barr would use this workshop to lay the groundwork for that bill. </p><p>While Barr never said the word 'encryption,' he clearly drew the connection \u2014 just as Berin predicted in a shorter piece[7] just before Barr's speech. Berin's long Twitter thread[8] summarized the CSAM-230 connection the night beforehand and continued throughout the workshop. This piece ran quite long, so we've broken it into three parts: This post, on why Section 230 is important, how it works, and how panelists proposed to amend it. Part two, which will be posted later today, discussing how Section 230 has never applied to federal criminal law, but a host of questions remain about new federal laws, state criminal laws and more. Part three, which will be posted next week, discussing what's really driving the DOJ. Are they just trying to ban encryption? And can we get tough on CSAM without amending Section 230 or banning encryption? Why Section 230 Is Vital to the InternetThe workshop's unifying themes were 'responsibility' and 'accountability.' Critics claim Section 230 prevents stopping bad actors online. Actually, Section 230 places responsibility and liability on the correct party: whoever actually created the content, be it defamatory, harassing, generally awful, etc. Section 230 has never prevented legal action against individual users \u2014 or against tech companies for content they themselves create (or for violations of federal criminal law, as we discuss in Part II). But Section 230 does ensure that websites won't face a flood of lawsuits for every piece of content they publish. One federal court decision (ultimately finding the website responsible for helping to create user content and thus not protected by Section 230) put this point best:Websites are complicated enterprises, and there will always be close cases where a clever lawyer could argue that something the website operator did encouraged the illegality. Such close cases, we believe, must be resolved in favor of immunity, lest we cut the heart out of section 230 by forcing websites to face death by ten thousand duck-bites, fighting off claims that they promoted or encouraged \u2014 or at least tacitly assented to \u2014 the illegality of third parties.Several workshop panelists talked about 'duck-bites' but none really explained the point clearly: One duck-bite can't kill you, but ten thousand might. Likewise, a single lawsuit may be no big deal, at least for large companies, but the scale of content on today's social media is so vast that, without Section 230, a large website might face far more than ten thousand suits. Conversely, litigation is so expensive that even one lawsuit could well force a small site to give up on hosting user content altogether. A single lawsuit can mean death by ten thousand duck-bites: an extended process of appearances, motions, discovery, and, ultimately, either trial or settlement that can be ruinously expensive. The most cumbersome, expensive, and invasive part may be 'discovery': if the plaintiff's case turns on a question of fact, they can force the defendant to produce that evidence. That can mean turning a business inside out \u2014 and protracted fights over what evidence you do and don't have to produce. The process can easily be weaponized, especially by someone with a political ax to grind. Section 230(c)(1) avoids all of that by allowing courts to dismiss lawsuits without defendants having to go through discovery or argue difficult questions of First Amendment case law or the potentially infinite array of potential causes of action. Some have argued that we don't need Section 230(c)(1) because websites should ultimately prevail[9] on First Amendment grounds or that the common law might have developed to allow websites to prevail in court. The burden of litigating such cases at the scale of the Internet \u2014 i.e., for each of the billions and billions of pieces of content created by users found online, or even the thousands, hundreds or perhaps even dozens of comments that a single, humble website might host \u2014 would be impossible to manage. As Profs. Jeff Kosseff and Eric Goldman explained on the first panel, Congress understood that websites wouldn't host user content if the law imposed on them the risk of even a few duck bites per posting. But Congress also understood that, if websites faced increased liability for attempting to moderate harmful or objectionable user content on their sites, they'd do less content moderation \u2014 and maybe none at all. That was the risk created by Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co. (1995)[10]: Whereas CompuServe had, in 1991, been held not responsible for user content because it did not attempt to moderate user content, Prodigy was held responsible because it did. Section 230 solved both problems. And it was essential that, the year after Congress enacted Section 230, a federal appeals court in Zeran v. America Online, Inc.[11] construed the law broadly. Zeran ensured that Section 230 would protect websites generally against liability for user content \u2014 essentially, it doesn't matter whether plaintiffs call websites 'publishers' or 'distributors.' Pat Carome, a partner at WilmerHale and lead defense counsel in Zeran, deftly explained the road not taken: If AOL had a legal duty as a 'distributor' to take down content anyone complained about, anything anyone complained about would be taken down, and users would lose opportunities to speak at all. Such a notice-and-takedown system just won't work at the scale of the Internet. Why Both Parts of Section 230 Are Necessary Section 230(c)(1) says simply that 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service [content host] shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider [content creator].' Many Section 230 critics, especially Republicans, have seized upon this wording, insisting that Facebook, in particular, really is a 'publisher' and so should be held 'accountable' as such. This misses the point of Section 230(c)(1), which is to abolish the publisher/distributor distinction as irrelevant. Miami Law Professor Mary Anne Franks proposed scaling back, or repealing, 230(c)(1) but leaving 230(c)(2)(A), which shields 'good faith' moderation practices. She claimed this section is all that tech companies need to continue operations as 'Good Samaritans.' But as Prof. Goldman has explained[12], you need both parts of Section 230 to protect Good Samaritans: (c)(1) protects decisions to publish or not to publish broadly, while (c)(2) protects only proactive decisions to remove content. Roughly speaking, (c)(1) protects against complaints that content should have been taken down or taken down faster, while (c)(2) protects against complaints that content should not have been taken down or that content was taken down selectively (or in a 'biased' manner). Moreover, (c)(2) turns on an operator's 'good faith,' which they must establish to prevail on a motion to dismiss. That question of fact opens the door to potentially ruinous discovery \u2014 many duck-bites. A lawsuit can usually be dismissed via Section 230(c)(1) for relatively trivial legal costs (say, &lt;$10k). But relying on a common law or 230(c)(2)(A) defense \u2014 as opposed to a statutory immunity \u2014 means having to argue both issues of fact and harder questions of law, and thus could raise that cost to easily ten times or more. Having to spend, say, $200k to win even a groundless lawsuit creates an enormous 'nuisance value' to such claims \u2014 which, in turn, encourages litigation for the purpose of shaking down companies to settle out of court. Class action litigation increases legal exposure for websites significantly: Though fewer in number, class actions are much harder to defeat because plaintiff's lawyers are generally sharp and intimately familiar with how to wield maximum pressure to settle through the legal system. This is a largely American phenomenon and helps to explain why Section 230 is so uniquely necessary in the United States. Imagining Alternatives The final panel discussed 'alternatives' to Section 230. FTC veteran Neil Chilson (now at the Charles Koch Institute) hammered a point that can't be made often enough: it's not enough to complain about Section 230; instead, we have to evaluate specific proposals to amend section 230 and ask whether they would make users better off. Indeed! That requires considering the benefits of Section 230(c)(1) as a true immunity that allows websites to avoid the duck-bites of the litigation (or state/local criminal prosecution) process. Here are a few proposed alternatives, focused on expanding civil liability. Part II (to be posted later today) will discuss expanding state and local criminal liability. Imposing Size Caps on 230's Protections Critics of Section 230 often try to side-step startup concerns by suggesting that any 230 amendments preserve the original immunity for smaller companies. For example, Sen. Hawley's Ending Support For Internet Censorship Act[13] would make 230 protections contingent upon FTC certification of the company's political neutrality if the company had 30 million active monthly U.S. users, more than 300 million active monthly users worldwide, or more than $500 million in global annual revenue. Julie Samuels, Executive Director of Tech:NYC, warned that such size caps would 'create a moat around Big Tech,' discouraging the startups she represents from growing. Instead, a size cap would only further incentivize startups to become acquired by Big Tech before they lose immunity. Prof. Goldman noted two reasons why it's tricky to distinguish between large and small players on the Internet: (1) several smaller companies are among the top 15 U.S. services, e.g., Craigslist, Wikipedia, and Reddit, with small staffs but large footprints; and (2) some enormous companies rarely deal with user generated content, e.g., Cloudflare, IBM, but these companies would still be faced with all of the obligations that apply to companies that had a bigger user generated footprint. You don't have to feel sorry for IBM to see the problem for users: laws like Hawley could drive such companies to get out of the business of hosting user-generated content altogether, deciding that it's too marginal to be worth the burden. Holding Internet Services Liable for Violating their Terms of Service Goldberg and other panelists proposed amending Section 230 to hold Internet services liable for violating their terms of service agreements. Usually, when breach of contract or promissory estoppel claims are brought against services, they involve post or account removals[14]. Courts almost always reject such claims on 230(c)(1) grounds as indirect attempts to hold the service liable as a publisher for those decisions. After all, Congress clearly intended to encourage websites to engage in content moderation, and removing posts or accounts is critical to how social media keep their sites usable. What Goldberg really wants is liability for failing to remove the type of content that sites explicitly disallow in their terms (e.g., harassment). But such liability would simply cause Internet services to make their terms of service less specific \u2014 and some might even stop banning harassment altogether. Making sites less willing to remove (or ban) harmful content is precisely the 'moderator's dilemma' that Section 230 was designed to avoid. Conversely, some complain that websites' terms of service are too vague \u2014 especially Republicans, who complain that, without more specific definitions of objectionable content, websites will wield their discretion in politically biased ways. But it's impossible for a service to foresee all of the types of awful content its users might create, so if websites have to be more specific in their terms of service, they'd have to constantly update their terms of service, and if they could be sued for failing to remove every piece of content they say they prohibit that's a lot of angry ducks. The tension between these two complaints should be clear. Section 230, as written, avoids this problem by simply protecting websites operators from having to litigate these questions. Finally, in general, contract law requires a plaintiff to prove both breach and damages/harm. But with online content, damages are murky. How is one harmed by a violation of a TOS? It's unclear exactly what Goldberg wants. If she's simply saying Section 230 should be interpreted, or amended, not to block contract actions based on supposed TOS violations, most of those are going to fail in court anyway for lack of damages. But if they allow a plaintiff to get a foot in the door, to survive an initial motion to dismiss based on some vague theory of alleged harm, even having to defend against lawsuits that will ultimately fail creates a real danger of death-by-duck-bites. Compounding the problem \u2014 especially if Goldberg is really talking about writing a new statute \u2014 is the possibility that plaintiffs' lawyers could tack on other, even flimsier causes of action. These should be dismissed under Section 230, but, again, more duck-bites. That's precisely the issue raised by Patel v. Facebook[15], where the Ninth Circuit allowed a lawsuit under Illinois' biometric privacy law to proceed based on a purely technical violation of the law (failure to deliver the exact form of required notice for the company's facial recognition tool). The Ninth Circuit concluded that such a violation, even if it amounted to 'intangible damages,' was sufficient to confer standing on plaintiffs to sue as a class without requiring individual damage showings by each member of the class. We recently[16] asked the Supreme Court to overrule the Ninth Circuit but they declined to take the case, leaving open the possibility that plaintiffs can get into federal court without alleging any clear damages. The result in Patel, as one might imagine, was a quick settlement by Facebook in the amount of $500 million shortly after the petition for certiorari was denied, given that the total statutory damages that would have been available to the class would have amounted to many billions. Even the biggest companies can be duck-bitten into massive settlements. Limiting Immunity to Traditional Publication Torts Several panelists claimed Section 230(c)(1) was intended to only cover traditional publication torts (defamation, libel and slander) and that over time, courts have wrongly broadened the immunity's coverage. But there's just no evidence for this revisionist account. Prof. Kosseff found no evidence for this interpretation after exhaustive research on Section 230's legislative history for his definitive book[17]. Otherwise, as Carome noted, Congress wouldn't have needed to contemplate the other non-defamation related exceptions in the statute, like intellectual property, and federal criminal law. Anti-Conservative Bias Republicans have increasingly fixated on one overarching complaint: that Section 230 allows social media and other Internet services to discriminate against them, and that the law should require political neutrality. (Given the ambiguity of that term and the difficulty of assessing patterns at the scale the content available on today's Internet, in practice, this requirement would actually mean giving the administration the power to force websites to favor them.) The topic wasn't discussed much during the workshop, but, according to multiple reports from participants, it dominated the ensuing roundtable. That's not surprising, given that the roundtable featured only guests invited by the Attorney General. The invite list isn't public and the discussion was held under Chatham House rules, but it's a safe bet that it was a mix of serious (but generally apolitical) Section 230 experts and the Star Wars cantina freak show of right-wing astroturf activists who have made a cottage industry out of extending the Trumpist persecution complex to the digital realm. TechFreedom has written extensively on the unconstitutionality of inserting the government into the exercise of editorial discretion by website operators. Just for example, read our statement[18] on Sen. Hawley's proposed legislation on regulating the Internet and Berin's 2018 Congressional testimony[19] on the idea (and Section 230, at that shit-show of a House Judiciary hearing that featured Diamond and Silk). Also read our 2018 letter[20] to Jeff Sessions, Barr's predecessor, on the unconstitutionality of attempting to coerce websites in how they exercise their editorial discretion. Conclusion Section 230 works by ensuring that duck-bites can't kill websites (though federal criminal prosecution can, as Backpage.com discovered the hard way \u2014 see Part II). This avoids both the moderator's dilemma (being more liable if you try to clean up harmful content) and that websites might simply decide to stop hosting user content altogether. Without Section 230(c)(1)'s protection, the costs of compliance, implementation, and litigation could strangle smaller companies even before they emerge. Far from undermining 'Big Tech,' rolling back Section 230 could entrench today's giants. Several panelists poo-pooed the 'duck-bites' problem, insisting that each of those bites involve real victims on the other side. That's fair, to a point. But again, Section 230 doesn't prevent anyone from holding responsible the person who actually created the content. Prof. Kate Klonick (St. John's Law) reminded the workshop audience of 'Balk's law[21]': 'THE INTERNET IS PEOPLE. The problem is people. Everything can be reduced to this one statement. People are awful. Especially you, especially me. Given how terrible we all are it's a wonder the Internet isn't so much worse.' Indeed, as Prof. Goldman noted[22], however new technologies might aggravate specific problems, better technologies are essential to facilitating better interaction. We can't hold back the tide of change; the best we can do is to try to steer the Digital Revolution in better directions. And without Section 230, innovation in content moderation technologies would be impossible. For further reading, we recommend the seven principles[23] we worked with a group of leading Section 230 experts to draft last summer. Several panelists referenced them at the workshop, but they didn't get the attention they deserved. Signed by 27 other civil society organizations across the political spectrum and 53 academics, we think they represent the best starting point for how to think about Section 230 yet offered. Next up, in Part II, how Section 230 intersects with the criminal law. And, in Part III... what's really driving the DOJ, banning encryption, and how to get tough on CSAM.Permalink[24] | Comments[25] | Email This Story[26] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/video/section-230-workshop-nurturing-innovation-or-fostering-unaccountability\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/video/section-230-workshop-nurturing-innovation-or-fostering-unaccountability</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/ag/webform/section-230-workshop-registration?fbclid=IwAR10ZkJYMxH83CTrto8AdSHNiBlQu9rcOC0rpLnIP8c_YgjHVCN5HL5wgeo\">https://www.justice.gov/ag/webform/section-230-workshop-registration?fbclid=IwAR10ZkJYMxH83CTrto8AdSHNiBlQu9rcOC0rpLnIP8c_YgjHVCN5HL5wgeo</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230\">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://amzn.to/2KefBvx\">https://amzn.to/2KefBvx</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-opening-remarks-doj-workshop-section-230\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-opening-remarks-doj-workshop-section-230</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200131/11252343832/lindsey-grahams-sneak-attack-section-230-encryption-backdoor-to-backdoor.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200131/11252343832/lindsey-grahams-sneak-attack-section-230-encryption-backdoor-to-backdoor.shtml</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://morningconsult.com/opinions/bill-barr-declares-war-on-the-internet-as-we-know-it/\">https://morningconsult.com/opinions/bill-barr-declares-war-on-the-internet-as-we-know-it/</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/BerinSzoka/status/1229957851067682816\">https://twitter.com/BerinSzoka/status/1229957851067682816</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://digitalcommons.law.ou.edu/olr/vol72/iss3/4/\">https://digitalcommons.law.ou.edu/olr/vol72/iss3/4/</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratton_Oakmont,_Inc._v._Prodigy_Services_Co\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratton_Oakmont,_Inc._v._Prodigy_Services_Co</url>.

Mike Lee has been conspicuously circumspect about how the federal government should respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He says Congress is ill-equipped to tackle complex antitrust issues. He's skeptical federal antitrust laws can fix the bad behavior big tech is accused of. On Tuesday he called out the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice for squabbling over who should investigate Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In the past, the agencies have avoided too much mischief because they have generally played well with each other. This appears to have, regrettably, changed,\" the Utah Republican said to agency heads who appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. \"None of this makes for effective or efficient antitrust enforcement.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lee, who chairs the panel, wasn't the only senator to go after FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general over the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.</p><p>\"We are entering a gilded age in the tech industry,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a Democratic presidential candidate, said during a break in the hearing, referring to a time in U.S. history that led to the first antitrust laws. \"We can't effectively enforce antitrust laws when we have someone in the White House throwing fire bombs\" that undermine antitrust enforcement.</p><p>She and other Democrats on the panel accused the agencies of caving into White House pressure by approving the Sprint-T-Mobile merger and investigating whether talks between automakers and California officials over that state's auto emission standards violated antitrust laws.</p><p>The hearing comes amid a movement pushing back on a trend of increased corporate concentration and declining antitrust enforcement. While the concentration has occurred in several industries, the concern has primarily focused on big tech, which politicians, academics and activists say has an outsized influence over Americans' economic, political and private lives. In addition to the Justice Department and FTC investigations into Google and Facebook, attorneys general from 48 states, including Utah, announced coordinated probes into possible anticompetitive conduct by Google. A smaller scale investigation by nine states will look into Facebook's dominance. Congress has also jumped in, grilling representatives of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon in ongoing hearings and introducing legislation in a rare bipartisan backlash against Silicon Valley.</p><p>The avalanche of inquiries into big technology was years in the making and will take years to sort out and litigate. But opinions vary on the eventual remedies: Can regulators impose fines big enough to change the behavior of multibillion dollar corporations? Or, will they mandate the restructuring of an entire tech industry, like the government did in its breaking up of the oil industry more than a century ago and the phone business in the 1980s?</p><p>\"That's what these digital platforms are afraid of,\" says Jorge Contreras, a University of Utah law professor. \"They aren't afraid of another billion- dollar fine, they can afford that. But a structural remedy would be identity altering for these companies.\"</p><p>'Hipster antitrust'</p><p>While Lee invites oversight into anti-competitive conduct in the digital technology industry, he's skeptical of what he calls \"hipster antitrust\" theory. He described it as enforcement too focused on price gouging and overlooking anticompetitive conduct in markets where consumers receive services for free.</p><p>Since Congress passed the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, outlawing monopolistic control of a market, the prevailing theory was \"big is bad\" in business. That changed, however, in the 1970s, when economic stagnation prompted a rethinking of antitrust enforcement.</p><p>What gradually took hold among legal scholars, economists, judges and government regulators was an antitrust orthodoxy that big wasn't inherently bad if it didn't harm consumers. A more relaxed approach to antitrust ensued as regulators and the courts preferred to let the market sort out tensions among competing firms as long as consumers were held harmless.</p><p>That's the antitrust world Lee is accustomed to.</p><p>But The Wall Street Journal cited data that showed that Justice Department antitrust complaints in 2017 were 61% below 1981 levels, while the number of reported mergers per year are more than seven times the pace of 40 years ago.</p><p>It's been during this era of lax enforcement that tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft flourished. While Microsoft ran afoul of antitrust regulators for using its operating system to lord over competitors in the personal computer market, other companies involved in search engines, social media, mobile phone apps and retailing were largely left alone.</p><p>\"If you think about doing a little bit less enforcement every year for 40 years you get past the sweet spot and eventually you are under enforcing,\" says Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale School of Management who also worked in the antitrust division of the Justice Department in the Obama administration.</p><p>In this past decade, however, academics like Scott Morton and activists have argued the pendulum has swung too far in favor of corporate concentration. They contend that the digital business model that provides its services for free can still engage in anticompetitive behavior that harms consumers by misusing private data and stifling innovation by competing firms.</p><p>Luigi Zingales, a finance professor and director of the University of Chicago's Stigler Center, explained that digital platforms are unique to other industries because they are at once complex in how they do business, strategically necessary in society and government functions, and able to mobilize large groups of people on a grassroots level.</p><p>\"That combination is unprecedented and honestly, pretty scary,\" he said.</p><p>Some committee members shared that same concern and urged Simons and Delrahim to focus their investigation on restructuring tech giants - and to do it quickly.</p><p>\"Facebook has acquired more than 70 companies over the past decade and a half, they are moving forward,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. \"They are structuring their companies so that you can unscramble the egg.\"</p><p>A split investigation</p><p>Lee questioned Simons and Delrahim if current antitrust laws can address problems such as dominant digital media platforms silencing competing viewpoints.</p><p>They said if a monopolist uses its market power to prevent a competitor with a different political viewpoint from entering the market that conduct could impact the consumer and fall within antitrust rules.</p><p>\"My sense is this would be better suited for another set of tools\" other than antitrust rules, Simons said.</p><p>Neither regulator would discuss details of their respective investigations into Facebook or Google, nor did they go into detail on their current dispute, other than to say it happens, but it's rare.</p><p>But Lee pressed that even if they could pursue broad antitrust claims against a digital platform, the current setup of two agencies charged with the same task is a confusing and inefficient method of enforcement.</p><p>\"Former FTC Chairman Bill Kovacic has called this 'nuts,' and I agree,\" Lee said.</p><p>He asked if either Simons or Delrahim would recommend a similar arrangement to a foreign country setting up an antitrust oversight system.</p><p>\"It's not the best model of efficiency,\" Delrahim said, noting that in addition to federal oversight, state attorneys general also have authority to investigate antitrust violations under federal and state laws.</p><p>But Delrahim, Simons and other senators, several of whom are former state attorneys general, also defended the system that's been in place for decades - although several senators complained the federal agencies are not doing enough.</p><p>\"I'd rather have a split investigation than no investigation,\" Klobuchar said. \"And I assume part of the reason why you split this is you don't have enough resources individually, to take this on yourselves while you're doing your other work.\"</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mbrown@deseretnews.com\">mbrown@deseretnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-46012349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2X-36G1-DY6J-M017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

'We asked Facebook to provide us with information,' wrote Therrien. 'We are disappointed to note that many of our questions have remained unanswered or have not been satisfactorily answered.'The commissioner was investigating the impact of the so-calledCambridge Analytica scandalon Canadians. His conclusion? Facebook 'has waived its responsibility for the personal information under its control.'</p><p><br/><br/><br/>Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien tells an April 25 news conference in Ottawa that Facebook has waived its responsibility for the personal information under its control.<br/>The Canadian Press/Adrian Wyld<br/><br/><br/>An impotent systemWhat is also clear in this report is the impotence of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Of course, Canada has thePersonal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act , but even if Therrien demonstrated that Facebook had violated the act, he doesn't have the power to sanction the company. And Facebook knows that very well.Personal data protection laws are no longer sufficient. Artificial intelligence, fuelled by considerable volumes of data (popularly known as Big Data), raises new, complex, constantly and rapidly evolving ethical, economic and political issues.I'm not the only one who thinks so. So does the British government, in a report published in late April. TheOnline Harms White Paperis a particularly remarkable document. It highlights the Trudeau government's prodigious indolence in addressing these issues. It also describes various types of harm caused by online activities in general, and digital social platforms in particular. These range from mismanagement of personal data to crimes such as child abuse, fraud and misinformation (which is my area of interest).<br/>Read more:<br/>What the U.K.'s Online Harms white paper teaches us about internet regulation<br/><br/>Taking the digital bull by the hornsThe report is remarkable because of the solutions it proposes \u2014 solutions that Canadian legislators must urgently consider. Digital technology is everywhere in today's society, and regulating it is a crucial mission that requires the creation of a new independent body with legislative reach. I have identified four powers that are mentioned in the British report.<br/>1. Accountability through fines and prosecutionsTheGeneral Regulation on Data Protection of the European Union , adopted in 2016, already provides for fines of up to 20 million euros (CDN$30 million), or four per cent of a company's worldwide annual profit. In the case of Facebook, this would represent more than CDN$3 billion.The Online Harms report goes further by saying that business leaders should also be accountable in court if their company is liable for damage to British society. This is subject to future consultation, but mentioning it is revolutionary.<br/><br/><br/>The Online Harms report recommends that the managers of a company responsible for harming British society should be held accountable in court.<br/>Shutterstock<br/><br/><br/>2. Disrupt the activities of delinquent companiesI rubbed my eyes in amazement when I read the recommendation: 'Disruption of business activities' in the British report. The United Kingdom government is considering reserving the right to interfere with the activities of online businesses that do not comply with the regulations. What form might these disruptions take? Block internet traffic to problematic services? This extreme measure would only be taken in the most serious cases where the safety of citizens is clearly at stake.<br/>3. Monitor algorithmsAs Therrien pointed out in his report, his British counterpart already has investigative powers under theData Protection Act of 2018 . In the UK, a warrant can be used to show what happens to collected data. The act gives the British Information Commissioner investigative powers that are very similar to those available to police officers.Although these powers are already light years away from what is possible in Canada, the Online Harms report goes even further by proposing upstream monitoring of algorithms. It wants to require companies that use collected data to publish annual transparency reports. The regulator will need to be able to comprehend what is being done with citizens' data and understand how the algorithms of the web giants work. Companies that refuse will be subject to penalties.<br/>4. Collaborate with researchersFinally, the British report welcomes the opening of some platforms to collaboration with the academic research community. However, in my point of view, it is not demanding enough in this crucial respect.It is precisely one of the roles of research to study societal phenomena. As more and more of these phenomena occur in private online platforms, the law must require companies to open their windows for researchers to observe what's happening inside.Most platforms, like Google, Twitter or Facebook, haveapplication programming interfaces or APIs . Researchers have been using them to study, for example, thepolarization of political discourseorthe spread of misinformation .<br/><br/><br/>Unlike Twitter, which has a fairly open API, Instagram and WhatsApp, both of which belong to Facebook, have nothing that can inform researchers.<br/>Shutterstock<br/><br/>But not all platforms have APIs. Twitter has a fairly open and data-rich API. But Instagram and WhatsApp, both of which belong to Facebook, have none that can be used by researchers. Not being able to understand how information flows through these platforms is a concern, and it's in the public interest to understand the flow of information on digital social media.In April 2018, the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) asked online platforms togive researchers access to their data through APIs specifically dedicated to scientific research . For the most part, the web giants have remained deaf to this petition. Here again, it is up to legislators to force their hands in the public interest.I have a wish for 2020: that the Trudeau government enters the 21st century, that it stops cowering in front of the big tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, and that it adopts laws that will finally allow Canadians to know and understand what these companies really do with their data.This should be a top issue in the upcoming federal election campaign.This article was originally published inFrench<br/>&lt;ul&gt;<br/>Social media<br/><br/>Privacy<br/><br/>Politics<br/><br/>Internet regulation<br/><br/>Cambridge Analytica<br/><br/>&lt;/ul&gt;<br/><br/>MENAFN1106201901990000ID1098632337</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1098632337</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-FT61-F04Y-T0TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1131\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Disclosure information is available on the original site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">___</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Author: Jean-Hugues Roy, Professeur, Ecole des mEdias, Universite du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Political cartoonist Serge Chapleau summed it up neatly. His April 27 cartoon in Montreal's La Presse showed Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wearing a T-shirt with a thumb representing Facebook's \"like\" button transformed into a middle-finger salute.</p><p>Facebook's cavalier attitude is palpable in the report that Daniel Therrien, Canada's privacy commissioner, released two days earlier. \"We asked Facebook to provide us with information,\" wrote Therrien. \"We are disappointed to note that many of our questions have remained unanswered or have not been satisfactorily answered.\"</p><p>The commissioner was investigating the impact of the so-called Cambridge Analytica scandal on Canadians. His conclusion? Facebook \"has waived its responsibility for the personal information under its control.\"</p><p>An impotent system</p><p>What is also clear in this report is the impotence of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Of course, Canada has the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, but even if Therrien demonstrated that Facebook had violated the act, he doesn't have the power to sanction the company. And Facebook knows that very well.</p><p>Personal data protection laws are no longer sufficient. Artificial intelligence, fuelled by considerable volumes of data (popularly known as Big Data), raises new, complex, constantly and rapidly evolving ethical, economic and political issues.</p><p>I'm not the only one who thinks so. So does the British government, in a report published in late April. The Online Harms White Paper is a particularly remarkable document. It highlights the Trudeau government's prodigious indolence in addressing these issues. It also describes various types of harm caused by online activities in general, and digital social platforms in particular. These range from mismanagement of personal data to crimes such as child abuse, fraud and misinformation (which is my area of interest).</p><p>Taking the digital bull by the horns</p><p>The report is remarkable because of the solutions it proposes - solutions that Canadian legislators must urgently consider. Digital technology is everywhere in today's society, and regulating it is a crucial mission that requires the creation of a new independent body with legislative reach. I have identified four powers that are mentioned in the British report.</p><p>1. Accountability through fines and prosecutions</p><p>The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, adopted in 2016, already provides for fines of up to 20 million euros (CDN$30 million), or four per cent of a company's worldwide annual profit. In the case of Facebook, this would represent more than CDN$3 billion.</p><p>The Online Harms report goes further by saying that business leaders should also be accountable in court if their company is liable for damage to British society. This is subject to future consultation, but mentioning it is revolutionary.</p><p>2. Disrupt the activities of delinquent companies</p><p>I rubbed my eyes in amazement when I read the recommendation: \"Disruption of business activities\" in the British report. The United Kingdom government is considering reserving the right to interfere with the activities of online businesses that do not comply with the regulations. What form might these disruptions take? Block internet traffic to problematic services? This extreme measure would only be taken in the most serious cases where the safety of citizens is clearly at stake.</p><p>3. Monitor algorithms</p><p>As Therrien pointed out in his report, his British counterpart already has investigative powers under the Data Protection Act of 2018. In the UK, a warrant can be used to show what happens to collected data. The act gives the British Information Commissioner investigative powers that are very similar to those available to police officers.</p><p>Although these powers are already light years away from what is possible in Canada, the Online Harms report goes even further by proposing upstream monitoring of algorithms. It wants to require companies that use collected data to publish annual transparency reports. The regulator will need to be able to comprehend what is being done with citizens' data and understand how the algorithms of the web giants work. Companies that refuse will be subject to penalties.</p><p>4. Collaborate with researchers</p><p>Finally, the British report welcomes the opening of some platforms to collaboration with the academic research community. However, in my point of view, it is not demanding enough in this crucial respect.</p><p>It is precisely one of the roles of research to study societal phenomena. As more and more of these phenomena occur in private online platforms, the law must require companies to open their windows for researchers to observe what's happening inside.</p><p>Most platforms, like Google, Twitter or Facebook, have application programming interfaces or APIs. Researchers have been using them to study, for example, the polarization of political discourse or the spread of misinformation.</p><p>But not all platforms have APIs. Twitter has a fairly open and data-rich API. But Instagram and WhatsApp, both of which belong to Facebook, have none that can be used by researchers. Not being able to understand how information flows through these platforms is a concern, and it's in the public interest to understand the flow of information on digital social media.</p><p>In April 2018, the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) asked online platforms to give researchers access to their data through APIs specifically dedicated to scientific research. For the most part, the web giants have remained deaf to this petition. Here again, it is up to legislators to force their hands in the public interest.</p><p>I have a wish for 2020: that the Trudeau government enters the 21st century, that it stops cowering in front of the big tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, and that it adopts laws that will finally allow Canadians to know and understand what these companies really do with their data.</p><p>This should be a top issue in the upcoming federal election campaign.</p><p>___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

If you're interested in how our current cultural anxieties - climate catastrophe, decline of transatlantic political orders, resurgent nuclear terror - manifest themselves in apocalyptic visions, you're interested in the place occupied by this distant archipelago of apparent peace and stability against the roiling unease of the day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you're interested in the end of the world, you would have been interested, soon after Donald Trump's election as US president, to read a New York Times headline stating that Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook, considered New Zealand to be \"the Future\". Because if you are in any serious way concerned about the future, you're also concerned about Thiel, a canary in capitalism's coal mine who also happens to have profited lavishly from his stake in the mining concern itself.</p><p>Thiel is in one sense a caricature of outsized villainy: he was the only major Silicon Valley figure to put his weight behind the Trump presidential campaign; he vengefully bankrupted a website because he didn't like how they wrote about him; he is known for his public musings about the incompatibility of freedom and democracy, and for expressing interest - as though enthusiastically pursuing the clunkiest possible metaphor for capitalism at its most vampiric - in a therapy involving transfusions of blood from young people as a potential means of reversing the ageing process. But in another, deeper sense, he is pure symbol: less a person than a shell company for a diversified portfolio of anxieties about the future, a human emblem of the moral vortex at the centre of the market.</p><p>It was in 2011 that Thiel declared he'd found \"no other country that aligns more with my view of the future than New Zealand\". The claim was made as part of an application for citizenship; the application was swiftly granted, though it remained a secret for a further six years. In 2016, Sam Altman, one of Silicon Valley's most influential entrepreneurs, revealed to the New Yorker  that he had an arrangement with Thiel whereby in the eventuality of some kind of systemic collapse scenario - synthetic virus breakout, rampaging AI, resource war between nuclear-armed states, so forth - they both get on a private jet and fly to a property Thiel owns in New Zealand. (The plan from this point, you'd have to assume, was to sit out the collapse of civilisation before re-emerging to provide seed-funding for, say, the insect-based protein sludge market.)</p><p>In the immediate wake of that Altman revelation, Matt Nippert, a reporter for the New Zealand Herald, began looking into the question of how exactly Thiel had come into possession of this apocalypse retreat, a 477-acre former sheep station in the South Island - the larger, more sparsely populated of the country's two major landmasses. Foreigners looking to purchase significant amounts of New Zealand land typically have to pass through a stringent government vetting process. In Thiel's case, Nippert learned, no such process had been necessary, because he was already a citizen of New Zealand, despite having spent no more than 12 days in the country up to that point, and having not been seen in the place since. He didn't even need to travel to New Zealand to have his citizenship conferred, it turned out: the deal was sealed in a private ceremony at a consulate handily located in Santa Monica.</p><p>When Nippert broke the story, there was a major public scandal over the question of whether a foreign billionaire should be able to effectively purchase citizenship. As part of his application, Thiel had agreed to invest in New Zealand tech startups, and had implied that he would use his new status as a naturalised Kiwi to promote the country's business interests abroad. But the focus internationally was on why Thiel might have wanted to own a chunk of New Zealand roughly the size of lower Manhattan in the first place. And the overwhelming suspicion was that he was looking for a rampart to which he could retreat in the event of outright civilisational collapse.</p><p>Because this is the role that New Zealand now plays in our unfurling cultural fever dream: an island haven amid a rising tide of apocalyptic unease. According to the country's Department of Internal Affairs, in the two days following the 2016 election the number of Americans who visited its website to enquire about the process of gaining New Zealand citizenship increased by a factor of 14 compared to the same days in the previous month. In particular, New Zealand has come to be seen as a bolthole of choice for Silicon Valley's tech elite.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of Trump's election, the theme of American plutocrats preparing for the apocalypse was impossible to avoid. The week after the inauguration, the New Yorker ran another piece about the super-rich who were making preparations for a grand civilisational crackup; speaking of New Zealand as a \"favored refuge in the event of a cataclysm\", billionaire LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, a former colleague of Thiel's at PayPal, claimed that \"saying you're 'buying a house in New Zealand' is kind of a wink, wink, say no more\".</p><p>Everyone is always saying these days that it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. Everyone is always saying it, in my view, because it's obviously true. The perception, paranoid or otherwise, that billionaires are preparing for a coming civilisational collapse seems a literal manifestation of this axiom. Those who are saved, in the end, will be those who can afford the premium of salvation. And New Zealand, the furthest place from anywhere, is in this narrative a kind of new Ararat: a place of shelter from the coming flood.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>Early last summer, just as my interests in the topics of civilisational collapse and Peter Thiel were beginning to converge into a single obsession, I received out of the blue an email from a New Zealand art critic named Anthony Byrt. If I wanted to understand the extreme ideology that underpinned Thiel's attraction to New Zealand, he insisted, I needed to understand an obscure libertarian manifesto called The Sovereign Individual: How to Survive and Thrive During the Collapse of the Welfare State. It was published in 1997, and in recent years something of a minor cult has grown up around it in the tech world, largely as a result of Thiel's citing it as the book he is most influenced by. (Other prominent boosters include Netscape founder and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, and Balaji Srinivasan, the entrepreneur best known for advocating Silicon Valley's complete secession from the US to form its own corporate city-state.)</p><p>The Sovereign Individual's co-authors are James Dale Davidson, a private investor who specialises in advising the rich on how to profit from economic catastrophe, and the late William Rees-Mogg, long-serving editor of the Times. (One other notable aspect of Lord Rees-Mogg's varied legacy is his own son, the Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg - a hastily sketched caricature of an Old Etonian, who is as beloved of Britain's ultra-reactionary pro-Brexit right as he is loathed by the left.)</p><p>I was intrigued by Byrt's description of the book as a kind of master key to the relationship between New Zealand and the techno-libertarians of Silicon Valley. Reluctant to enrich Davidson or the Rees-Mogg estate any further, I bought a used edition online, the musty pages of which were here and there smeared with the desiccated snot of whatever nose-picking libertarian preceded me.</p><p>It presents a bleak vista of a post-democratic future. Amid a thicket of analogies to the medieval collapse of feudal power structures, the book also managed, a decade before the invention of bitcoin, to make some impressively accurate predictions about the advent of online economies and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The book's 400-odd pages of near-hysterical orotundity can roughly be broken down into the following sequence of propositions:</p><p>1) The democratic nation-state basically operates like a criminal cartel, forcing honest citizens to surrender large portions of their wealth to pay for stuff like roads and hospitals and schools.</p><p>2) The rise of the internet, and the advent of cryptocurrencies, will make it impossible for governments to intervene in private transactions and to tax incomes, thereby liberating individuals from the political protection racket of democracy.</p><p>3) The state will consequently become obsolete as a political entity.</p><p>4) Out of this wreckage will emerge a new global dispensation, in which a \"cognitive elite\" will rise to power and influence, as a class of sovereign individuals \"commanding vastly greater resources\" who will no longer be subject to the power of nation-states and will redesign governments to suit their ends.</p><p>The Sovereign Individual is, in the most literal of senses, an apocalyptic text. Davidson and Rees-Mogg present an explicitly millenarian vision of the near future: the collapse of old orders, the rising of a new world. Liberal democracies will die out, and be replaced by loose confederations of corporate city-states. Western civilisation in its current form, they insist, will end with the millennium. \"The new Sovereign Individual,\" they write, \"will operate like the gods of myth in the same physical environment as the ordinary, subject citizen, but in a separate realm politically.\" It's impossible to overstate the darkness and extremity of the book's predictions of capitalism's future; to read it is to be continually reminded that the dystopia of your darkest insomniac imaginings is almost always someone else's dream of a new utopian dawn.</p><p>Davidson and Rees-Mogg identified New Zealand as an ideal location for this new class of sovereign individuals, as a \"domicile of choice for wealth creation in the Information Age\". Byrt, who drew my attention to these passages, had even turned up evidence of a property deal in the mid-1990s in which a giant sheep station at the southern tip of the North Island was purchased by a conglomerate whose major shareholders included Davidson and Rees-Mogg. Also in on the deal was one Roger Douglas, the former Labour finance minister who had presided over a radical restructuring of New Zealand economy along neoliberal lines in the 1980s. (This period of so-called \" Rogernomics \", Byrt told me - the selling off of state assets, slashing of welfare, deregulation of financial markets - created the political conditions that had made the country such an attractive prospect for wealthy Americans.)</p><p>Thiel's interest in New Zealand was certainly fuelled by his JRR Tolkien obsession: this was a man who had named at least five of his companies in reference to The Lord of the Rings, and fantasised as a teenager about playing chess against a robot that could discuss the books. It was a matter, too, of the country's abundance of clean water and the convenience of overnight flights from California. But it was also inseparable from a particular strand of apocalyptic techno-capitalism. To read The Sovereign Individual was to see this ideology laid bare: these people, the self-appointed \"cognitive elite\", were content to see the unravelling of the world as long as they could carry on creating wealth in the end times.</p><p>I was struck by how strange and disquieting it must have been for a New Zealander to see their own country refracted through this strange apocalyptic lens. There was certainly an ambient awareness that the tech world elite had developed an odd interest in the country as an ideal end-times bolthole; it would have been difficult, at any rate, to ignore the recent cascade of articles about Thiel acquiring citizenship, and the apocalyptic implications of same. But there seemed to have been basically zero discussion of the frankly alarming ideological dimension of it all.</p><p>It was just this ideological dimension, as it happened, that was the focus of a project Byrt himself had recently got involved in, a new exhibition by the artist Simon Denny. Denny, a significant figure in the international art scene, was originally from Auckland, but has lived for some years in Berlin. Byrt described him as both \"kind of a genius\" and \"the poster-boy for post-internet art, whatever that is\"; he characterised his own role in the project with Denny as an amalgamation of researcher, journalist and \"investigative philosopher, following the trail of ideas and ideologies\".</p><p>The exhibition was called The Founder's Paradox, a name that came from the title of one of the chapters in Thiel's 2014 book, Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future. Together with the long and intricately detailed catalogue essay Byrt was writing to accompany it, the show was a reckoning with the future that Silicon Valley techno-libertarians like Thiel wanted to build, and with New Zealand's place in that future.</p><p>These were questions I too was eager to reckon with. Which is to say that I myself was interested - helplessly, morbidly - in the end of the world, and that I was therefore interested in New Zealand. And so I decided to go there, to see for myself the land that Thiel had apparently set aside for the collapse of civilisation: a place that would become for me a kind of labyrinth, and whose owner I was already beginning to mythologise as the monster at its centre.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>Within about an hour of arriving in Auckland, I was as close to catatonic from fatigue as made no difference, and staring into the maw of a volcano. I was standing next to Byrt, who'd picked me up from the airport and, in a gesture I would come to understand as quintessentially Kiwi, dragged me directly up the side of a volcano. This particular volcano, Mount Eden, was a fairly domesticated specimen, around which was spread one of the more affluent suburbs of Auckland - the only city in the world, I learned, built on a technically still-active volcanic field.</p><p>I was a little out of breath from the climb and, having just emerged in the southern hemisphere from a Dublin November, sweating liberally in the relative heat of the early summer morning. I was also experiencing near-psychotropic levels of jetlag. I must have looked a bit off, because Byrt - a bearded, hoodied and baseball-capped man in his late 30s - offered a cheerful apology for playing the volcano card so early in the proceedings.</p><p>\"I probably should have eased you into it, mate\" he chuckled. \"But I thought it'd be good to get a view of the city before breakfast.\"</p><p>The view of Auckland and its surrounding islands was indeed ravishing - though in retrospect, it was no more ravishing than any of the countless other views I would wind up getting ravished by over the next 10 days. That, famously, is the whole point of New Zealand: if you don't like getting ravished by views, you have no business in the place; to travel there is to give implicit consent to being hustled left, right and centre into states of aesthetic rapture.</p><p>\"Plus I've been in the country mere minutes,\" I said, \"and I've already got a perfect visual metaphor for the fragility of civilisation in the bag.\"</p><p>I was referring here to the pleasingly surreal spectacle of a volcanic crater overlaid with a surface of neatly manicured grass. (I jotted this observation down in my notebook, feeling as I did so a smug infusion of virtue about getting some literary non-fiction squared away before even dropping my bags off at the hotel. \"Volcano with lawn over it,\" I scrawled. \"Visual manifestation of thematic motif: Civ as thin membrane stretched over chaos.\")</p><p>I remarked on the strangeness of all these Silicon Valley geniuses supposedly apocalypse-proofing themselves by buying up land down here right on the Pacific Ring of Fire, the horseshoe curve of geological fault lines that stretches upward from the western flank of the Americas, back down along the eastern coasts of Russia and Japan and on into the South Pacific.</p><p>\"Yeah,\" said Byrt, \"but some of them are buying farms and sheep stations pretty far inland. Tsunamis aren't going to be a big issue there. And what they're after is space, and clean water. Two things we've got a lot of down here.\"</p><p>The following day, I went to the gallery in downtown Auckland to take a look at The Founder's Paradox. Denny, a neat and droll man in his mid-30s, talked me through the conceptual framework. It was structured around games - in theory playable, but in practice encountered as sculptures - representing two different kinds of political vision for New Zealand's future. The bright and airy ground floor space was filled with tactile, bodily game-sculptures, riffs on Jenga and Operation and Twister. These works, incorporating collaborative and spontaneous ideas of play, were informed by a recent book called The New Zealand Project by a young leftwing thinker named Max Harris, which explored a humane, collectivist politics influenced by Maori beliefs about society.</p><p>Down in the low-ceilinged, dungeon-like basement was a set of sculptures based around an entirely different understanding of play, more rule-bound and cerebral. These were based on the kind of strategy-based role-playing games particularly beloved of Silicon Valley tech types, and representing a Thielian vision of the country's future. The psychological effect of this spatial dimension of the show was immediate: upstairs, you could breathe, you could see things clearly, whereas to walk downstairs was to feel oppressed by low ceilings, by an absence of natural light, by the darkness of the geek-apocalypticism captured in Denny's elaborate sculptures.</p><p>This was a world Denny himself knew intimately. And what was strangest and most unnerving about his art was the sense that he was allowing us to see this world not from the outside in, but from the inside out. Over beers in Byrt's kitchen the previous night, Denny had told me about a dinner party he had been to in San Francisco earlier that year, at the home of a techie acquaintance, where he had been seated next to Curtis Yarvin, founder of the Thiel-funded computing platform Urbit. As anyone who takes an unhealthy interest in the weirder recesses of the online far-right is aware, Yarvin is more widely known as the blogger Mencius Moldbug, the intellectual progenitor of Neoreaction, an antidemocratic movement that advocates for a kind of white-nationalist oligarchic neofeudalism - rule by and for a self-proclaimed cognitive elite - and which has found a small but influential constituency in Silicon Valley. It was clear that Denny was deeply unsettled by Yarvin's brand of nerd autocracy, but equally clear that breaking bread with him was in itself no great discomfort.</p><p>Beneath all the intricacy and detail of its world-building, The Founder's Paradox was clearly animated by an uneasy fascination with the utopian future imagined by the techno-libertarians of Silicon Valley, and with New Zealand's role in that future. The exhibition's centrepiece was a tabletop strategy game called Founders, which drew heavily on the aesthetic - as well as the explicitly colonialist language and objectives - of Settlers of Catan, a cult multiplayer strategy board game. The aim of Founders, clarified by the accompanying text and by the piece's lurid illustrations, was not simply to evade the apocalypse, but to prosper from it. First you acquired land in New Zealand, with its rich resources and clean air, away from the chaos and ecological devastation gripping the rest of the world. Next you moved on to seasteading, the libertarian ideal of constructing manmade islands in international waters; on these floating utopian micro-states, wealthy tech innovators would be free to go about their business without interference from democratic governments. (Thiel was an early investor in, and advocate of, the seasteading movement, though his interest has waned in recent years.) Then you mined the moon for its ore and other resources, before moving on to colonise Mars. This last level of the game reflected the current preferred futurist fantasy, most famously advanced by Thiel's former PayPal colleague Elon Musk, with his dream of fleeing a dying planet Earth for privately owned colonies on Mars.</p><p>The influence of the Sovereign Individual, and of Byrt's obsession with it, was all over the show. It was a detailed mapping of a possible future, in all its highly sophisticated barbarism. It was a utopian dream that appeared, in all its garish detail and specificity, as the nightmare vision of a world to come.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>Thiel himself had spoken publicly of New Zealand as a \"utopia\", during the period in 2011 when he was manoeuvring for citizenship, investing in various local startups under a venture capital fund called Valar Ventures. (I hardly need to tell you that Valar is another Tolkien reference.) This was a man with a particular understanding of what a utopia might look like, who did not believe, after all, in the compatibility of freedom and democracy. In a Vanity Fair article about his role as adviser to Trump's campaign, a friend was quoted as saying that \"Thiel has said to me directly and repeatedly that he wanted to have his own country\", adding that he had even gone so far as to price up the prospect at somewhere around $100bn.</p><p>The Kiwis I spoke with were uncomfortably aware of what Thiel's interest in their country represented, of how it seemed to figure more generally in the frontier fantasies of American libertarians. Max Harris - the author of The New Zealand Project, the book that informed the game-sculptures on the upper level of The Founder's Paradox - pointed out that, for much of its history, the country tended to be viewed as a kind of political Petri dish (it was, for instance, the first nation to recognise women's right to vote), and that this \"perhaps makes Silicon Valley types think it's a kind of blank canvas to splash ideas on\".</p><p>When we met in her office at the Auckland University of Technology, the legal scholar Khylee Quince insisted that any invocation of New Zealand as a utopia was a \"giant red flag\", particularly to Maori like herself. \"That is the language of emptiness and isolation that was always used about New Zealand during colonial times,\" she said. And it was always, she stressed, a narrative that erased the presence of those who were already here: her own Maori ancestors. The first major colonial encounter for Maori in the 19th century was not with representatives of the British crown, she pointed out, but with private enterprise. The New Zealand Company was a private firm founded by a convicted English child kidnapper named Edward Gibbon Wakefield, with the aim of attracting wealthy investors with an abundant supply of inexpensive labour - migrant workers who could not themselves afford to buy land in the new colony, but who would travel there in the hope of eventually saving enough wages to buy in. The company embarked on a series of expeditions in the 1820s and 30s; it was only when the firm started drawing up plans to formally colonise New Zealand, and to set up a government of its own devising, that the British colonial office advised the crown to take steps to establish a formal colony. In the utopian fantasies of techno-libertarians like Thiel, Quince saw an echo of that period of her country's history. \"Business,\" she said, \"got here first.\"</p><p>Given her Maori heritage, Quince was particularly attuned to the colonial resonances of the more recent language around New Zealand as both an apocalyptic retreat and a utopian space for American wealth and ingenuity.</p><p>\"I find it incredibly offensive,\" she said. \"Thiel got citizenship after spending 12 days in this country, and I don't know if he's even aware that Maori exist. We as indigenous people have a very strong sense of intergenerational identity and collectivity. Whereas these people, who are sort of the contemporary iteration of the coloniser, are coming from an ideology of rampant individualism, rampant capitalism.\"</p><p>Quince's view was by no means the norm. New Zealanders tend to be more flattered than troubled by the interest of Silicon Valley tech gurus in their country. It's received by and large as a signal that the tyranny of distance - the extreme antipodean remoteness that has shaped the country's sense of itself since colonial times - has finally been toppled by the liberating forces of technology and economic globalisation.</p><p>\"It's very appealing,\" the political scientist Peter Skilling told me, \"these entrepreneurs saying nice things about us. We're like a cat having its tummy rubbed. If Silicon Valley types are welcomed here, it's not because we're particularly susceptible to libertarian ideas; it's because we are complacent and naive.\"</p><p>Among the leftwing Kiwis I spoke with, there had been a kindling of cautious optimism, sparked by the recent surprise election of a new Labour-led coalition government, under the leadership of the 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern, whose youth and apparent idealism suggested a move away from neoliberal orthodoxy. During the election, foreign ownership of land had been a major talking point, though it focused less on the wealthy apocalypse-preppers of Silicon Valley than the perception that overseas property speculators were driving up the cost of houses in Auckland. The incoming government had committed to tightening regulations around land purchases by foreign investors. This was largely the doing of Winston Peters, a nationalist of Maori descent whose New Zealand First party held the balance of power, and was strongly in favour of tightening regulations of foreign ownership. When I read that Ardern had named Peters as her deputy prime minister, I was surprised to recognise the name - from, of all places, The Sovereign Individual, where Davidson and Rees-Mogg had singled him out for weirdly personal abuse as an arch-enemy of the rising cognitive elite, referring to him as a \"reactionary loser\" and \"demagogue\" who would \"gladly thwart the prospects for long-term prosperity just to prevent individuals from declaring their independence of politics\".</p><p>During my time in New Zealand, Ardern was everywhere: in the papers, on television, in every other conversation. On our way to Queenstown in the South Island, to see for ourselves the site of Thiel's apocalyptic bolthole, Byrt and I were in the security line at Auckland airport when a woman of about our age, smartly dressed and accompanied by a cluster of serious-looking men, glanced in our direction as she was conveyed quickly along the express lane. She was talking on her phone, but looked towards us and waved at Byrt, smiling broadly in happy recognition.</p><p>\"Who was that?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Jacinda,\" he said.</p><p>\"You know her?\"</p><p>\"We know quite a lot of the same people. We met for a drink a couple of times back when she was Labour's arts spokesperson.\"</p><p>\"Really?\"</p><p>\"Well yeah,\" he laughed, \"there's only so many of us.\"</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>\"The endgame for Thiel is essentially The Sovereign Individual,\" said Byrt. He was driving the rental car, allowing me to fully devote my resources to the ongoing cultivation of aesthetic rapture (mountains, lakes, so forth). \"And the bottom line for me,\" he said, \"is that I don't want my son to grow up in that future.\"</p><p>We were on our way to see for ourselves the part of New Zealand, on the shore of Lake Wanaka in the South Island, that Thiel had bought for purposes of post-collapse survival. We talked about the trip as though it were a gesture of protest, but it felt like a kind of perverse pilgrimage. The term \"psychogeography\" was cautiously invoked, and with only the lightest of ironic inflections.</p><p>\"The thing about Thiel is he's the monster at the heart of the labyrinth,\" said Byrt.</p><p>\"He's the white whale,\" I suggested, getting into the literary spirit of the enterprise.</p><p>Byrt's obsession with Thiel occupied a kind of Melvillean register, yearned toward a mythic scale. It coloured his perception of reality. He admitted, for instance, to a strange aesthetic pathology whereby he encountered, in the alpine grandeur of the South Island, not the sublime beauty of his own home country, but rather what he imagined Thiel seeing in the place: Middle-earth. Thiel's Tolkien fixation was itself a fixation for Byrt: together with the extreme libertarianism of The Sovereign Individual, he was convinced that it lay beneath Thiel's continued interest in New Zealand.</p><p>Matt Nippert, the New Zealand Herald journalist who had broken the citizenship story earlier that year, told me he was certain that Thiel had bought the property for apocalypse-contingency purposes. In his citizenship application, he had pledged his commitment to devote \"a significant amount of time and resources to the people and businesses of New Zealand\". But none of this had amounted to much, Nippert said, and he was convinced it had only ever been a feint to get him in the door as a citizen.</p><p>In a cafe in Queenstown, about an hour's drive from Thiel's estate, Byrt and I met a man to whom a wealthy acquaintance of Byrt's had introduced us. A well known and well connected professional in Queenstown, he agreed to speak anonymously for fear of making himself unpopular among local business leaders and friends in the tourism trade. He had been concerned for a while now about the effects on the area of wealthy foreigners buying up huge tracts of land. (\"Once you start pissing in the hand basin, where are you gonna wash your face?\" as he put to me, in what I assumed was a purely rhetorical formulation.) He told us of one wealthy American of his acquaintance, \"pretty left-of-centre\", who had bought land down here to allay his apocalyptic fears in the immediate aftermath of Trump's election. Another couple he knew of, a pair of bitcoin billionaires, had bought a large lakeside estate on which they were constructing a gigantic bunker.</p><p>This was the first I'd heard since coming here of an actual bunker being built. From the point of view of the modern apocalypticist, the whole appeal of the country - its remoteness and stability, its abundant clean water, its vast and lovely reaches of unpeopled land - was that it was itself a kind of reinforced geopolitical shelter, way down there at the bottom of the world.</p><p>The people I spoke to in the property business were keen to portray New Zealand as a kind of utopian sanctuary, but to give as little oxygen as possible to the related narrative around the country as an apocalyptic bolthole for the international elite. Over coffee at his golf club near Queenstown, Terry Spice, a London-born luxury property specialist who had recently sold a large estate abutting the Thiel property on Lake Wanaka, said he felt Thiel had highlighted internationally that the country was \"a safe haven, and a legacy asset\". He himself had sold land to one very wealthy American client who had called him on the night of the presidential election. \"This guy couldn't believe what was happening. He wanted to secure something right away.\" But on the whole, he insisted, this kind of apocalyptically motivated buyer represented a vanishingly small proportion of the market.</p><p>Showing me around the high-end beachfront properties he represented about an hour or so north of Auckland, another luxury property specialist named Jim Rohrstaff - a Californian transplant who specialised in selling to the international market - likewise told me that although quite a few of his major clients were Silicon Valley types, the end of the world tended not to be a particular factor in their purchasing decisions.</p><p>\"Look,\" he said, \"it might be one strand in terms of what's motivating them to buy here. But in my experience it's never been the overriding reason. It's much more of a positive thing. What they see when they come here is utopia.\"</p><p>In one sense, I knew what he meant by this. He meant excellent wine. He meant world-class golf. He meant agreeable climate, endless white sand beaches that scarcely aroused the suspicion of the existence of other human beings. But having lately spoken to Khylee Quince about the historical resonances of the concept of utopia, I wondered what else he might mean, and whether he intended to mean it or not.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>In Queenstown, before we set out to find the former sheep station Thiel had bought, we went to look for the house he owned in the town itself. This place, we speculated, must have been purchased as a kind of apocalyptic pied-a-terre: somewhere he could base himself, maybe, while whatever construction he had planned for the sheep station was underway. Nippert had given us the address; we found it easily enough, not far from the centre of town, and recognised it right away from one of the paintings in The Founder's Paradox. It was the sort of house a Bond villain might build if for some reason he'd been forced to move to the suburbs. It looked modestly ostentatious, if such a thing was possible; the front of the building was one giant window, gazing out blankly over the town and the lake below. There was some construction going on in the place. I wandered up the drive and asked the builders if they knew who their client was. \"No idea, mate,\" they said. They were just doing some renovation on contract. There'd been a fire in the place a while back, apparently. Nothing sinister, just wiring.</p><p>The next day, we made our way to Lake Wanaka, where the larger rural property was located. We rented bikes in the town, and followed the trail around the southern shore of the lake. It got rockier and more mountainous the further we pursued it, and by the time we knew for certain we were on Thiel's property, I was so hot and exhausted that all I could think to do was plunge into the lake to cool off. I asked Anthony whether he thought the water was safe to drink, and he said he was sure of it, given that its purity and its plenty was a major reason a billionaire hedging against the collapse of civilisation would want to buy land there in the first place. I swam out further into what I had come to think of as Thiel's apocalypse lake and, submerging my face, I drank so deeply that Anthony joked he could see the water level plunging downward by degrees. In truth, I drank well beyond the point of quenching any literal thirst; in a way that felt absurd and juvenile, and also weirdly and sincerely satisfying, I was drinking apocalypse water, symbolically reclaiming it for the 99%. If in that moment I could have drained Lake Wanaka just to fuck up Thiel's end-of-the-world contingency plan, I might well have done so.</p><p>I suggested I might take a rock, a piece of the place to bring home and keep on my desk, but Byrt warned me that to do so would be a transgression of the Maori understanding of the land's communal sacredness. We scrabbled up the stony flank of a hill and sat for a while looking out over the calm surface of the lake to the distant snowy peaks, and over the green and undulating fields unfurling into the western distance, all of it the legal possession of a man who had designs on owning a country, who believed that freedom was incompatible with democracy.</p><p>Later, we made our way to the far side of the property, bordering the road, where we saw the only actual structure on the entire property: a hay barn. It is the opinion of this reporter that Thiel himself had no hand in its construction.</p><p>\"There you have it,\" said Byrt. \"Eyeball evidence that Thiel is stockpiling hay for the collapse of civilisation.\" I wish to state categorically that we did not steal so much as a single straw from that barn.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>We had made it to the centre of the labyrinth, but it was elsewhere in the end that the monster materialised. In early December, a couple of weeks after I'd left the country, Max Harris, the young Kiwi author whose book Denny and Byrt had used as a counterpoint to Thiel's ideas, was home for Christmas, and went along to the gallery to see the exhibition.</p><p>Down in the basement, in the central chamber - with its low ceilings, its iron vault door, its F\u00fchrerbunkerishly oppressive vibe - Harris encountered, staring intently downward into the glass case containing the Founders game, a man in shorts and a blue polo shirt, surrounded by a group of younger men, likewise polo-shirted. The older man was doughier and less healthy-looking than he appeared in photographs, Harris told me, but he had little doubt as to his identity.</p><p>Harris, who was aware that Peter Thiel had not been seen in New Zealand since 2011, asked the man whether he was who he thought he was; the man smirked and, without raising his eyes from the board game toward Harris, replied that a lot of people had been asking him just that question. Harris asked the man what he thought of the exhibition, and the man paused a long time before saying that it was \"actually a work of phenomenal detail\". He asked Harris if he knew the artist, and Harris said that he did, that he himself was in a fact a writer whose work had formed part of the conceptual framework for the show. Of the sheer improbability of these two men- one for whom New Zealand was a means of shoring up his wealth and power in a coming civilisational collapse, one for whom it was home, a source of hope for a more equal and democratic society - just happening to cross paths at an art exhibition loosely structured around the binary opposition of their political views no mention was made, and they went their separate ways.</p><p>Thiel left his contact details with the gallery, suggesting that Denny get in touch. He did, and Thiel responded quickly; he'd been intrigued by what he had seen, but claimed to be a little disturbed by how dark his cyber-libertarianism appeared when refracted through the lens of The Founder's Paradox. In any case, the conversation continued, and they made arrangements to meet on Denny's next trip to the US.</p><p> Related:  Coders of the world, unite: can Silicon Valley workers curb the power of Big Tech?</p><p>Denny was eager to keep talking, if only because he was determined to reach a deeper understanding of Thiel's vision of the future. Byrt, the more straightforwardly political in his antagonism toward Thiel and what he represented, was bewildered by this unexpected turn of events, though strangely thrilled by it, too. For my part, this came as a disorienting rug-pull ending - partly because the monster had materialised, and he was therefore no longer merely a human emblem of the moral vortex at the centre of capitalism, but also an actual human, goofily got up in polo shirt and shorts, sweating in the heat, traipsing along to an art gallery to indulge his human curiosity about what the art world thought of his notoriously weird and extreme politics. A sovereign individual in the same physical environment as us ordinary subject citizens.

After decades of rarely apologising for anything, Silicon Valley suddenly seems to be apologising for everything. They are sorry about the trolls. They are sorry about the bots. They are sorry about the fake news and the Russians, and the cartoons that are terrifying your kids on YouTube. But they are especially sorry about our brains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sean Parker, the former president of Facebook - who was played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network - has publicly lamented the \"unintended consequences\" of the platform he helped create: \"God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.\" Justin Rosenstein, an engineer who helped build Facebook's \"like\" button and Gchat, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">regrets</url> having contributed to technology that he now considers psychologically damaging, too. \"Everyone is distracted,\" Rosenstein says. \"All of the time.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ever since the internet became widely used by the public in the 1990s, users have heard warnings that it is bad for us. In the early years, many commentators described cyberspace as a parallel universe that could swallow enthusiasts whole. The media fretted about kids talking to strangers and finding porn. A prominent 1998 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">study</url> from Carnegie Mellon University claimed that spending time online made you lonely, depressed and antisocial.</p><p>In the mid-2000s, as the internet moved on to mobile devices, physical and virtual life began to merge. Bullish pundits celebrated the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">\"cognitive surplus\"</url> unlocked by crowdsourcing and the tech-savvy campaigns of Barack Obama, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">\"internet president\"</url>. But, alongside these optimistic voices, darker warnings persisted. Nicholas Carr's The Shallows (2010) argued that search engines were making people stupid, while Eli Pariser's The Filter Bubble (2011) claimed algorithms made us insular by showing us only what we wanted to see. In Alone, Together (2011) and Reclaiming Conversation (2015), Sherry Turkle warned that constant connectivity was making meaningful interaction impossible.</p><p>Still, inside the industry, techno-utopianism prevailed. Silicon Valley seemed to assume that the tools they were building were always forces for good - and that anyone who questioned them was a crank or a luddite. In the face of an anti-tech backlash that has surged since the 2016 election, however, this faith appears to be faltering. Prominent people in the industry are beginning to acknowledge that their products may have harmful effects.</p><p>Internet anxiety isn't new. But never before have so many notable figures within the industry seemed so anxious about the world they have made. Parker, Rosenstein and the other insiders now talking about the harms of smartphones and social media belong to an informal yet influential current of tech critics emerging within Silicon Valley. You could call them the \"tech humanists\". Amid rising public concern about the power of the industry, they argue that the primary problem with its products is that they threaten our health and our humanity.</p><p>It is clear that these products are designed to be maximally addictive, in order to harvest as much of our attention as they can. Tech humanists say this business model is both unhealthy and inhumane - that it damages our psychological well-being and conditions us to behave in ways that diminish our humanity. The main solution that they propose is better design. By redesigning technology to be less addictive and less manipulative, they believe we can make it healthier - we can realign technology with our humanity and build products that don't \"hijack\" our minds.</p><p>The hub of the new tech humanism is the Center for Humane Technology in San Francisco. Founded earlier this year, the nonprofit has assembled an impressive roster of advisers, including investor Roger McNamee, Lyft president John Zimmer, and Rosenstein. But its most prominent spokesman is executive director Tristan Harris, a former \"design ethicist\" at Google who has been hailed by the Atlantic magazine as \"the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience\". Harris has spent years trying to persuade the industry of the dangers of tech addiction. In February, Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of eBay, launched a related initiative: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">the Tech and Society Solutions Lab</url>, which aims to \"maximise the tech industry's contributions to a healthy society\".</p><p>As suspicion of Silicon Valley grows, the tech humanists are making a bid to become tech's loyal opposition. They are using their insider credentials to promote a particular diagnosis of where tech went wrong and of how to get it back on track. For this, they have been getting a lot of attention. As the backlash against tech has grown, so too has the appeal of techies repenting for their sins. The Center for Humane Technology has been profiled - and praised by - the New York Times, the Atlantic, Wired and others.</p><p>But tech humanism's influence cannot be measured solely by the positive media coverage it has received. The real reason tech humanism matters is because some of the most powerful people in the industry are starting to speak its idiom. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has warned about social media's role in encouraging \"mindless scrambles for friends or unworthy distractions\", and Twitter boss Jack Dorsey recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">claimed</url> he wants to improve the platform's \"conversational health\".</p><p>Even Mark Zuckerberg, famous for encouraging his engineers to \"move fast and break things\", seems to be taking a tech humanist turn. In January, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">he announced</url> that Facebook had a new priority: maximising \"time well spent\" on the platform, rather than total time spent. By \"time well spent\", Zuckerberg means time spent interacting with \"friends\" rather than businesses, brands or media sources. He said the News Feed algorithm was already prioritising these \"more meaningful\" activities.</p><p>Zuckerberg's choice of words is significant: Time Well Spent is the name of the advocacy group that Harris led before co-founding the Center for Humane Technology. In April, Zuckerberg brought the phrase to Capitol Hill. When a photographer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">snapped</url> a picture of the notes Zuckerberg used while testifying before the Senate, they included a discussion of Facebook's new emphasis on \"time well spent\", under the heading \"wellbeing\".</p><p>This new concern for \"wellbeing\" may strike some observers as a welcome development. After years of ignoring their critics, industry leaders are finally acknowledging that problems exist. Tech humanists deserve credit for drawing attention to one of those problems - the manipulative design decisions made by Silicon Valley.</p><p>But these decisions are only symptoms of a larger issue: the fact that the digital infrastructures that increasingly shape our personal, social and civic lives are owned and controlled by a few billionaires. Because it ignores the question of power, the tech-humanist diagnosis is incomplete - and could even help the industry evade meaningful reform. Taken up by leaders such as Zuckerberg, tech humanism is likely to result in only superficial changes. These changes may soothe some of the popular anger directed towards the tech industry, but they will not address the origin of that anger. If anything, they will make Silicon Valley even more powerful.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>The Center for Humane Technology argues that technology must be \"aligned\" with humanity - and that the best way to accomplish this is through better design. Their website features <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">a section</url> entitled The Way Forward. A familiar evolutionary image shows the silhouettes of several simians, rising from their crouches to become a man, who then turns back to contemplate his history.</p><p>\"In the future, we will look back at today as a turning point towards humane design,\" the header reads. To the litany of problems caused by \"technology that extracts attention and erodes society\", the text asserts that \"humane design is the solution\". Drawing on the rhetoric of the \"design thinking\" philosophy that has long suffused Silicon Valley, the website explains that humane design \"starts by understanding our most vulnerable human instincts so we can design compassionately\".</p><p>There is a good reason why the language of tech humanism is penetrating the upper echelons of the tech industry so easily: this language is not foreign to Silicon Valley. On the contrary, \"humanising\" technology has long been its central ambition and the source of its power. It was precisely by developing a \"humanised\" form of computing that entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs brought computing into millions of users' everyday lives. Their success turned the Bay Area tech industry into a global powerhouse - and produced the digitised world that today's tech humanists now lament.</p><p>The story begins in the 1960s, when Silicon Valley was still a handful of electronics firms clustered among fruit orchards. Computers came in the form of mainframes then. These machines were big, expensive and difficult to use. Only corporations, universities and government agencies could afford them, and they were reserved for specialised tasks, such as calculating missile trajectories or credit scores.</p><p>Computing was industrial, in other words, not personal, and Silicon Valley remained dependent on a small number of big institutional clients. The practical danger that this dependency posed became clear in the early 1960s, when the US Department of Defense, by far the single biggest buyer of digital components, began cutting back on its purchases. But the fall in military procurement wasn't the only mid-century crisis around computing.</p><p>Computers also had an image problem. The inaccessibility of mainframes made them easy to demonise. In these whirring hulks of digital machinery, many observers saw something inhuman, even evil. To antiwar activists, computers were weapons of the war machine that was killing thousands in Vietnam. To highbrow commentators such as the social critic Lewis Mumford, computers were instruments of a creeping technocracy that threatened to extinguish personal freedom.</p><p>But during the course of the 1960s and 70s, a series of experiments in northern California helped solve both problems. These experiments yielded breakthrough innovations like the graphical user interface, the mouse and the microprocessor. Computers became smaller, more usable and more interactive, reducing Silicon Valley's reliance on a few large customers while giving digital technology a friendlier face.</p><p>The pioneers who led this transformation believed they were making computing more human. They drew deeply from the counterculture of the period, and its fixation on developing \"human\" modes of living. They wanted their machines to be \"extensions of man\", in the words of Marshall McLuhan, and to unlock \"human potential\" rather than repress it. At the centre of this ecosystem of hobbyists, hackers, hippies and professional engineers was Stewart Brand, famed entrepreneur of the counterculture and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">founder of the Whole Earth Catalog</url>. In a famous 1972 article for Rolling Stone, Brand called for a new model of computing that \"served human interest, not machine\".</p><p>Brand's disciples answered this call by developing the technical innovations that transformed computers into the form we recognise today. They also promoted a new way of thinking about computers - not as impersonal slabs of machinery, but as tools for unleashing \"human potential\".</p><p>No single figure contributed more to this transformation of computing than Steve Jobs, who was a fan of Brand and a reader of the Whole Earth Catalog. Jobs fulfilled Brand's vision on a global scale, launching the mass personal computing era with the Macintosh in the mid-80s, and the mass smartphone era with the iPhone two decades later. Brand later acknowledged that Jobs embodied the Whole Earth Catalog ethos. \"He got the notion of tools for human use,\" Brand told Jobs' biographer, Walter Isaacson.</p><p>Building those \"tools for human use\" turned out to be great for business. The impulse to humanise computing enabled Silicon Valley to enter every crevice of our lives. From phones to tablets to laptops, we are surrounded by devices that have fulfilled the demands of the counterculture for digital connectivity, interactivity and self-expression. Your iPhone responds to the slightest touch; you can look at photos of anyone you have ever known, and broadcast anything you want to all of them, at any moment.</p><p>In short, the effort to humanise computing produced the very situation that the tech humanists now consider dehumanising: a wilderness of screens where digital devices chase every last instant of our attention. To guide us out of that wilderness, tech humanists say we need more humanising. They believe we can use better design to make technology serve human nature rather than exploit and corrupt it. But this idea is drawn from the same tradition that created the world that tech humanists believe is distracting and damaging us.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>Tech humanists say they want to align humanity and technology. But this project is based on a deep misunderstanding of the relationship between humanity and technology: namely, the fantasy that these two entities could ever exist in separation.</p><p>It is difficult to imagine human beings without technology. The story of our species began when we began to make tools. Homo habilis, the first members of our genus, left sharpened stones scattered across Africa. Their successors hit rocks against each other to make sparks, and thus fire. With fire you could cook meat and clear land for planting; with ash you could fertilise the soil; with smoke you could make signals. In flickering light, our ancestors painted animals on cave walls. The ancient tragedian Aeschylus recalled this era mythically: Prometheus, in stealing fire from the gods, \"founded all the arts of men.\"</p><p>All of which is to say: humanity and technology are not only entangled, they constantly change together. This is not just a metaphor. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">Recent research</url> suggests that the human hand evolved to manipulate the stone tools that our ancestors used. The evolutionary scientist Mary Marzke shows that we developed \"a unique pattern of muscle architecture and joint surface form and functions\" for this purpose.</p><p>The ways our bodies and brains change in conjunction with the tools we make have long inspired anxieties that \"we\" are losing some essential qualities. For millennia, people have feared that new media were eroding the very powers that they promised to extend. In The Phaedrus, Socrates warned that writing on wax tablets would make people forgetful. If you could jot something down, you wouldn't have to remember it. In the late middle ages, as a culture of copying manuscripts gave way to printed books, teachers warned that pupils would become careless, since they no longer had to transcribe what their teachers said.</p><p>Yet as we lose certain capacities, we gain new ones. People who used to navigate the seas by following stars can now program computers to steer container ships from afar. Your grandmother probably has better handwriting than you do - but you probably type faster.</p><p>The nature of human nature is that it changes. It can not, therefore, serve as a stable basis for evaluating the impact of technology. Yet the assumption that it doesn't  change serves a useful purpose. Treating human nature as something static, pure and essential elevates the speaker into a position of power. Claiming to tell us who we are, they tell us how we should be.</p><p>Intentionally or not, this is what tech humanists are doing when they talk about technology as threatening human nature - as if human nature had stayed the same from the paleolithic era until the rollout of the iPhone. Holding humanity and technology separate clears the way for a small group of humans to determine the proper alignment between them. And while the tech humanists may believe they are acting in the common good, they themselves acknowledge they are doing so from above, as elites. \"We have a moral responsibility to steer people's thoughts ethically,\" Tristan Harris has declared.</p><p>Harris and his fellow tech humanists also frequently invoke the language of public health. The Center for Humane Technology's Roger McNamee has gone so far as to call public health \"the root of the whole thing\", and Harris has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">compared</url> using Snapchat to smoking cigarettes. The public-health framing casts the tech humanists in a paternalistic role. Resolving a public health crisis requires public health expertise. It also precludes the possibility of democratic debate. You don't put the question of how to treat a disease up for a vote - you call a doctor.</p><p>This paternalism produces a central irony of tech humanism: the language that they use to describe users is often dehumanising. \"Facebook appeals to your lizard brain - primarily fear and anger,\" says McNamee. Harris echoes this sentiment: \"Imagine you had an input cable,\" he has said. \"You're trying to jack it into a human being. Do you want to jack it into their reptilian brain, or do you want to jack it into their more reflective self?\"</p><p>The Center for Humane Technology's website offers tips on how to build a more reflective and less reptilian relationship to your smartphone: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">\"going greyscale\"</url> by setting your screen to black-and-white, turning off app notifications and charging your device outside your bedroom. It has also announced two major initiatives: a national campaign to raise awareness about technology's harmful effects on young people's \"digital health and well-being\"; and a \"Ledger of Harms\" - a website that will compile information about the health effects of different technologies in order to guide engineers in building \"healthier\" products.</p><p>These initiatives may help some people reduce their smartphone use - a reasonable personal goal. But there are some humans who may not share this goal, and there need not be anything unhealthy about that. Many people rely on the internet for solace and solidarity, especially those who feel marginalised. The kid with autism may stare at his screen when surrounded by people, because it lets him tolerate being surrounded by people. For him, constant use of technology may not be destructive at all, but in fact life-saving.</p><p>Pathologising certain potentially beneficial behaviours as \"sick\" isn't the only problem with the Center for Humane Technology's proposals. They also remain confined to the personal level, aiming to redesign how the individual user interacts with technology rather than tackling the industry's structural failures. Tech humanism fails to address the root cause of the tech backlash: the fact that a small handful of corporations own our digital lives and strip-mine them for profit. This is a fundamentally political and collective issue. But by framing the problem in terms of health and humanity, and the solution in terms of design, the tech humanists personalise and depoliticise it.</p><p>This may be why their approach is so appealing to the tech industry. There is no reason to doubt the good intentions of tech humanists, who may genuinely want to address the problems fuelling the tech backlash. But they are handing the firms that caused those problems a valuable weapon. Far from challenging Silicon Valley, tech humanism offers Silicon Valley a useful way to pacify public concerns without surrendering any of its enormous wealth and power. By channelling popular anger at Big Tech into concerns about health and humanity, tech humanism gives corporate giants such as Facebook a way to avoid real democratic control. In a moment of danger, it may even help them protect their profits.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>One can easily imagine a version of Facebook that embraces the principles of tech humanism while remaining a profitable and powerful monopoly. In fact, these principles could make Facebook even more profitable and powerful, by opening up new business opportunities. That seems to be exactly what Facebook has planned.</p><p>When Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would prioritise \"time well spent\" over total time spent, it came a couple weeks before the company released their 2017 Q4 earnings. These reported that total time spent on the platform had dropped by around 5%, or about 50m hours per day. But, Zuckerberg <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">said</url>, this was by design: in particular, it was in response to tweaks to the News Feed that prioritised \"meaningful\" interactions with \"friends\" rather than consuming \"public content\" like video and news. This would ensure that \"Facebook isn't just fun, but also good for people's well-being\".</p><p>Zuckerberg said he expected those changes would continue to decrease total time spent - but \"the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable\". This may describe what users find valuable - but it also refers to what Facebook finds valuable. In a recent interview, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">he said</url> : \"Over the long term, even if time spent goes down, if people are spending more time on Facebook actually building relationships with people they care about, then that's going to build a stronger community and build a stronger business, regardless of what Wall Street thinks about it in the near term.\"</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg has also stressed that the shift will create \"more monetisation opportunities\". How? Everyone knows data is the lifeblood of Facebook - but not all data is created equal. One of the most valuable sources of data to Facebook is used to inform a metric called \"coefficient\". This measures the strength of a connection between two users - Zuckerberg once called it \"an index for each relationship\". Facebook records every interaction you have with another user - from liking a friend's post or viewing their profile, to sending them a message. These activities provide Facebook with a sense of how close you are to another person, and different activities are weighted differently. Messaging, for instance, is considered the strongest signal. It's reasonable to assume that you're closer to somebody you exchange messages with than somebody whose post you once liked.</p><p>Why is coefficient so valuable? Because Facebook uses it to create a Facebook they think you will like: it guides algorithmic decisions about what content you see and the order in which you see it. It also helps improve ad targeting, by showing you ads for things liked by friends with whom you often interact. Advertisers can target the closest friends of the users who already like a product, on the assumption that close friends tend to like the same things.</p><p>So when Zuckerberg talks about wanting to increase \"meaningful\" interactions and building relationships, he is not succumbing to pressure to take better care of his users. Rather, emphasising time well spent means creating a Facebook that prioritises data-rich personal interactions that Facebook can use to make a more engaging platform. Rather than spending a lot of time doing things that Facebook doesn't find valuable - such as watching viral videos - you can spend a bit less time, but spend it doing things that Facebook does find valuable.</p><p>In other words, \"time well spent\" means Facebook can monetise more efficiently. It can prioritise the intensity of data extraction over its extensiveness. This is a wise business move, disguised as a concession to critics. Shifting to this model not only sidesteps concerns about tech addiction - it also acknowledges certain basic limits to Facebook's current growth model. There are only so many hours in the day. Facebook can't keep prioritising total time spent - it has to extract more value from less time.</p><p>In many ways, this process recalls an earlier stage in the evolution of capitalism. In the 19th century, factory owners in England discovered they could only make so much money by extending the length of the working day. At some point, workers would die of exhaustion, or they would revolt, or they would push parliament to pass laws that limited their working hours. So industrialists had to find ways to make the time of the worker more valuable - to extract more money from each moment rather than adding more moments. They did this by making industrial production more efficient: developing new technologies and techniques that squeezed more value out of the worker and stretched that value further than ever before.</p><p>A similar situation confronts Facebook today. They have to make the attention of the user more valuable - and the language and concepts of tech humanism can help them do it. So far, it seems to be working. Despite the reported drop in total time spent, Facebook recently announced huge 2018 Q1 earnings of $11.97bn (\u00a38.7bn), smashing Wall Street estimates by nearly $600m.</p><p>                   * * *                   </p><p>Today's tech humanists come from a tradition with deep roots in Silicon Valley. Like their predecessors, they believe that technology and humanity are distinct, but can be harmonised. This belief guided the generations who built the \"humanised\" machines that became the basis for the industry's enormous power. Today it may provide Silicon Valley with a way to protect that power from a growing public backlash - and even deepen it by uncovering new opportunities for profit-making.</p><p>Fortunately, there is another way of thinking about how to live with technology - one that is both truer to the history of our species and useful for building a more democratic future. This tradition does not address \"humanity\" in the abstract, but as distinct human beings, whose capacities are shaped by the tools they use. It sees us as hybrids of animal and machine - as \"cyborgs\", <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">to quote</url> the biologist and philosopher of science Donna Haraway.</p><p>To say that we're all cyborgs is not to say that all technologies are good for us, or that we should embrace every new invention. But it does suggest that living well with technology can't be a matter of making technology more \"human\". This goal isn't just impossible - it's also dangerous, because it puts us at the mercy of experts who tell us how to be human. It cedes control of our technological future to those who believe they know what's best for us because they understand the essential truths about our species.</p><p>The cyborg way of thinking, by contrast, tells us that our species is essentially technological. We change as we change our tools, and our tools change us. But even though our continuous co-evolution with our machines is inevitable, the way it unfolds is not. Rather, it is determined by who owns and runs those machines. It is a question of power.</p><p>Today, that power is wielded by corporations, which own our technology and run it for profit. The various scandals that have stoked the tech backlash all share a single source. Surveillance, fake news and the miserable <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">working conditions</url> in Amazon's warehouses are profitable. If they were not, they would not exist. They are symptoms of a profound democratic deficit inflicted by a system that prioritises the wealth of the few over the needs and desires of the many.</p><p>There is an alternative. If being technological is a feature of being human, then the power to shape how we live with technology should be a fundamental human right. The decisions that most affect our technological lives are far too important to be left to Mark Zuckerberg, rich investors or a handful of \"humane designers\". They should be made by everyone, together.</p><p>Rather than trying to humanise technology, then, we should be trying to democratise it. We should be demanding that society as a whole gets to decide how we live with technology - rather than the small group of people who have captured society's wealth.</p><p>What does this mean in practice? First, it requires limiting and eroding Silicon Valley's power. Antitrust laws and tax policy offer useful ways to claw back the fortunes Big Tech has built on common resources. After all, Silicon Valley wouldn't exist without billions of dollars of public funding, not to mention the vast quantities of information that we all provide for free. Facebook's market capitalisation is $500bn with 2.2 billion users - do the math to estimate how much the time you spend on Facebook is worth. You could apply the same logic to Google. There is no escape: whether or not you have an account, both platforms <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">track you</url> around the internet.</p><p>In addition to taxing and shrinking tech firms, democratic governments should be making rules about how those firms are allowed to behave - rules that restrict how they can collect and use our personal data, for instance, like the General Data Protection Regulation coming into effect in the European Union later this month. But more robust regulation of Silicon Valley isn't enough. We also need to pry the ownership of our digital infrastructure away from private firms.</p><p>This means developing publicly and co-operatively owned alternatives that empower workers, users and citizens to determine how they are run. These democratic digital structures can focus on serving personal and social needs rather than piling up profits for investors. One inspiring example is municipal broadband: a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">successful experiment</url> in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has shown that publicly owned internet service providers can supply better service at lower cost than private firms. Other models of digital democracy might include a worker-owned Uber, a user-owned Facebook or a socially owned \"smart city\" of the kind being developed       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">in Barcelona</url>. Alternatively, we might demand that tech firms pay for the privilege of extracting our data, so that we can collectively benefit from a resource we collectively create.</p><p>More experimentation is needed, but democracy should be our guiding principle. The stakes are high. Never before have so many people been thinking about the problems produced by the tech industry and how to solve them. The tech backlash is an enormous opportunity - and one that may not come again for a long time.</p><p>The old techno-utopianism is crumbling. What will replace it? Silicon Valley says it wants to make the world a better place. Fulfilling this promise may require a new kind of disruption.</p><p>                     Main illustration by Lee Martin/Guardian Design                   </p><p>\u00b7 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">@gdnlongread</url>, or sign up to the long read weekly email       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">here</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-43756052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S8R-N031-F021-60K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5030\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders raised $6 million from tech workers in the industry's California hub since the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign, more than double what was raised by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crowdpac.com/money-race/industry-influence\">https://www.crowdpac.com/money-race/industry-influence</url>) according to Crowdpac , a nonpartisan startup that analyzes data on contributions to candidates and their super PACs.</p><p>But something happened on the way to disruption: The actual votes were counted. Wealthy tech donors might have been feeling the Bern, but when the votes came in from Tuesday's California primary, the counties of Facebook, Google, Apple, Yahoo and Twitter were all solidly - indeed overwhelmingly - in the Hillary camp.</p><p>Voters in the wealthy, tech-heavy region including San Francisco County, San Mateo County and Santa Clara County helped secure the nomination for Clinton. The closest contest took place in San Francisco, where 55.6 percent voted for Clinton and 43.9 percent voted for Sanders. That county had the narrowest gap on the Democratic side compared with 60.9 percent for Clinton and 38.6 percent for Sanders in San Mateo, and 60.5 percent for Clinton and 38.8 percent for Sanders in Santa Clara.</p><p>Silicon Valley has been an important source of campaign cash for Democrats, surpassing Hollywood over the past few decades, but the tech industry has (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/faced-trump-or-clinton-silicon-valleys-political-donors-are-keeping-checkbooks-2337162\">http://www.ibtimes.com/faced-trump-or-clinton-silicon-valleys-political-donors-are-keeping-checkbooks-2337162</url>) reason to be wary of Clinton. Last July, she suggested that the on-demand economy, which includes companies like Uber and Airbnb, needed more workplace protections and regulations. She also changed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is strongly supported by the tech industry looking to penetrate Asian markets.</p><p>While Sanders opposed the TPP, his record in the Senate has shown support of the tech industry. Tech policy activists (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/14/election-2016-tech-policy-net-neutrality-bernie-sanders-donald-trump\">http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/14/election-2016-tech-policy-net-neutrality-bernie-sanders-donald-trump</url>) lean toward Sanders. Beyond the candidate's record, his campaign motto to not sit idle and to not stick to the status quo has led some Silicon Valley residents to feel the Bern.</p><p>But in the end, the vote in Silicon Valley looked a lot like the vote in Los Angeles County, which went 57.6 percent for Clinton and 41.4 percent for Sanders.</p><p>Going forward, this must give the Clinton campaign hope that Silicon Valley will open its checkbooks widely over the next five months as she works to defeat Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p><p>At some big tech companies, Clinton did out-raise Sanders, according to Federal Election Commission data (<url normalizedValue=\"http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/282419-silicon-valley-workers-send-more-cash-to-clinton\">http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/282419-silicon-valley-workers-send-more-cash-to-clinton</url>) analyzed by the Hill . Facebook employees have donated $136,957, with 83 percent going to Clinton and 17 percent to Sanders. One should note that Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was a Treasury official in the Bill Clinton administration. Employees at Oracle, HP, Twitter, LinkedIn and Netflix all favored Hillary Clinton. Donations from Google and Apple employees were most evenly split but also leaned toward Clinton.</p><p>Employees at Uber (not including drivers) favored Sanders 62 to 38 percent. But that makes sense given Clinton's stance on the on-demand economy.</p><p>To little surprise, Silicon Valley overall bled blue Tuesday. Out of 496,408 voters in the three regions, 411,354, or about 83 percent, voted for a Democratic nominee. The Bay Area has gone for a Democrat in every presidential election since 1984.</p><p>For those voters on the Republican side, real estate mogul Trump took the overwhelming majority. Trump secured 61.3 percent of the vote in San Francisco, 68.3 percent in San Mateo and 64.5 percent in Santa Clara. Ohio Gov. John Kasich captured the next largest number of votes for the Republican side, with about 20 percent in each county. Kasich was followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.</p><p>Even so, the culture of Silicon Valley runs in opposition to Trump's campaign.

Vermont<person><nameText>Sen. Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>raised $6 million from tech workers in the industry's California hub\u00a0since the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign, more than double what was raised by former Secretary of State\u00a0Hillary Clinton, according to Crowdpac[1], a nonpartisan startup that analyzes data on contributions to candidates and their super PACs. </p><p>But something happened on the way to disruption: The actual votes were counted. Wealthy tech donors might have been feeling the Bern, but when the votes came in from Tuesday's California primary, the counties of Facebook, Google, Apple, Yahoo and Twitter were all solidly\u00a0\u2014\u00a0indeed\u00a0overwhelmingly\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in the Hillary camp. Voters in the wealthy, tech-heavy\u00a0region\u00a0including San Francisco County, San Mateo County and Santa Clara County\u00a0helped secure the nomination for Clinton.\u00a0The closest\u00a0contest took place\u00a0in San Francisco, where 55.6 percent voted for Clinton and 43.9 percent voted for Sanders. That county had the narrowest gap on the Democratic side compared with\u00a060.9 percent for Clinton and 38.6 percent for Sanders in San Mateo, and\u00a060.5 percent for Clinton and 38.8 percent for Sanders in Santa Clara. //datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nnHXa/1/[2] Silicon Valley has been\u00a0an\u00a0important source\u00a0of campaign cash for Democrats, surpassing Hollywood over the past few decades, but the tech industry has reason to be wary[3] of Clinton. Last\u00a0July, she\u00a0suggested that the on-demand economy, which includes companies like Uber and Airbnb, needed\u00a0more workplace protections and regulations. She also changed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is strongly supported by the tech industry looking to penetrate Asian markets. While Sanders opposed the TPP, his record\u00a0in\u00a0the Senate has shown support of the tech industry. Tech policy activists lean\u00a0toward[4] Sanders. Beyond the candidate's\u00a0record,\u00a0his campaign motto\u00a0to not sit idle and to not\u00a0stick to the status quo\u00a0has led some Silicon Valley residents to feel\u00a0the Bern. But in the end, the\u00a0vote in Silicon Valley looked a lot like the vote in Los Angeles County, which went\u00a057.6 percent\u00a0for Clinton and 41.4 percent\u00a0for Sanders. //datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9uxA4/3/[5] Going forward, this must give the Clinton campaign hope that Silicon Valley will open its checkbooks widely over the next five months as she works to defeat Republican candidate\u00a0Donald Trump. At some big tech companies, Clinton did out-raise Sanders, according to Federal Election Commission data analyzed by the Hill[6].\u00a0Facebook employees have donated $136,957, with 83 percent going to Clinton and 17 percent to Sanders. One should note that Facebook Chief Operating Officer\u00a0Sheryl Sandberg was a Treasury official in the\u00a0Bill\u00a0Clinton administration.\u00a0Employees at\u00a0Oracle, HP, Twitter, LinkedIn and Netflix all favored <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>Donations from Google and Apple employees\u00a0were most evenly split but also leaned toward Clinton. Employees at Uber (not including drivers)\u00a0favored Sanders 62 to 38 percent. But that\u00a0makes sense given Clinton's stance on the on-demand economy. Supporters cheer as Democratic presidential candidate <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>speaks during a campaign event in San Francisco on May 26, 2016. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images To little surprise, Silicon Valley overall bled blue Tuesday. Out of 496,408 voters in the three regions, 411,354, or about 83 percent, voted for a Democratic nominee. The Bay Area\u00a0has gone\u00a0for a Democrat in every presidential election since 1984. For those voters on the Republican side, real estate mogul Trump took the overwhelming majority. Trump secured 61.3 percent of the vote in San Francisco, 68.3 percent in San Mateo and 64.5 percent in Santa Clara. Ohio Gov. John Kasich captured the next largest number of votes for the Republican side, with about 20 percent in each county. Kasich was followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon <person><nameText>Ben Carson. </nameText></person>//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HraSh/1/[7] Even so, the culture of Silicon Valley runs in opposition to Trump's campaign. Trump called for a boycott of Apple during the FBI-Apple dispute over opening the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter, for example. He also suggested the U.S. shut down the internet in regions controlled by ISIS. 'We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening,' Trump said during a speech\u00a0in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. 'We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some way. Somebody will say, 'Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech.'\u00a0These are foolish people.' The tech industry has donated just $21,815 to Trump, according to Crowdpac data. On the one hand, it#39;s like \"Sweet! I#39;m the presidential nominee.\" On the other, your next 5 months is arguing with a racist internet troll. - Aaron Levie (@levie) June 8, 2016[8] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crowdpac.com/money-race/industry-influence\">https://www.crowdpac.com/money-race/industry-influence</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nnHXa/1/\">http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nnHXa/1/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/faced-trump-or-clinton-silicon-valleys-political-donors-are-keeping-checkbooks-2337162\">http://www.ibtimes.com/faced-trump-or-clinton-silicon-valleys-political-donors-are-keeping-checkbooks-2337162</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/14/election-2016-tech-policy-net-neutrality-bernie-sanders-donald-trump\">http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/14/election-2016-tech-policy-net-neutrality-bernie-sanders-donald-trump</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9uxA4/3/\">http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9uxA4/3/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/282419-silicon-valley-workers-send-more-cash-to-clinton\">http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/282419-silicon-valley-workers-send-more-cash-to-clinton</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HraSh/1/\">http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HraSh/1/</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/levie/status/740412801357905920\">https://twitter.com/levie/status/740412801357905920</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX1087671465401860970251763500240</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JYP-8JF1-F03R-N26W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"951\"/><timeReceived>9:13 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>June 8, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But when Rimer returned to England a year ago after seven years establishing Index s U.S. foothold with stakes in companies like Dropbox, Etsy and Slack, he had company: investors from U.S. venture capital firms Benchmark, NEA and Sequoia were also appearing at startup dinners, leading deals and even looking to open offices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We ve always been surprised at how our U.S. peers flew over Europe,  says the Canada-born and Switzerland-raised Rimer, 49, who opened Index s London office in 2002. As a full-time European resident again, he debuts at No. 3 on the 2019 Midas List Europe, thanks to multi-national investments including Discord, Glossier, Farfetch and Squarespace. Rimer says he watched as investors flocked to pour money into India, China, and Latin American countries, instead.  A very successful Welshman talked about Europe being a museum,  says Rimer, alluding to billionaire investor Michael Moritz, the Sequoia partner and Google and Yahoo investor who moved from Wales to Silicon Valley decades ago.  Now his firm is all over the geo looking. \u00a0</p><p>More money is flowing into European tech than ever, and it s increasingly coming from venture capital s elite U.S. firms. European startups are likely to receive a record $34.3 billion in investments this year,<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>according to investment firm Atomico</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, with 19% of funding rounds including an American firm, double the portion when Atomico started tracking in 2015. Those American investors will account for about $10 billion, or nearly one-third, of the total amount invested.\u00a0</p><p>American interest in European companies isn t new: Palo Alto, California-founded Accelopened a London office nearly twenty years ago, and other firms followed suit. But many retreated in subsequent economic down cycles, says Philippe Botteri, No. 6 on Midas List Europe. Botteri, a French citizen, started his venture career at Bessemer Venture Partners in San Francisco and joined Accel in London in 2011. The years leading up to the U.S. firms  return witnessed a global economic crisis, while access to customers, engineering talent and programs like startup accelerator Y Combinator drove a host of European founders, such as Stripe s<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Collison brothers</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, to relocate to the U.S. Considered a splintered market with regional regulations and languages, Europe faced a fresh hurdle with  Brexit,  when the United Kingdom      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>voted in a 2016 referendum</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>to leave the European Union, a process still ongoing. Its ruling body, the European Union, has made an anchor policy of challenging big tech companies on how they use data.</p><p>Blossom Capital founder Ophelia Brown says she was met with incredulity when, as a young investor at Index Ventures between 2012 and 2016, she visited West Coast counterparts and described the opportunity in European tech.  Everyone would push back: Europe was a little travel, a little ecommerce, a little gaming,  she says.  They felt there was nothing of substance.  In 2017, when she set out to raise Blossom s<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>first fund</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, many U.S. investors told her the opportunity for new firms seemed greater in the U.S. and China. Just two years later, Brown says she now hears from institutions asking how to get more exposure to Europe s startup scene.\u00a0</p><p>What s changed: A mix of high-profile public offerings such as Adyen and Spotify and a maturing ecosystem that s made it a much easier draw for U.S. firms, facing intense competition at home, to risk millions in Europe. Spotify, the Stockholm-based music streaming service that went public via direct listing<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>in April 2018</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, and Adyen, the Amsterdam-based payments company that      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>went public two months later</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, have created nearly $50 billion in combined market value. The IPOs of      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Criteo in Paris</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>and      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Farfetch in London</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>have also produced a network of millionaires primed to write  angel investor  personal checks into smaller tech companies. Today there are 99 unicorns, or companies valued at one billion dollars or more, compared to 22 in 2015,      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>according to Atomico s data</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.</p><p> The question used to be, can Europe generate a $1 billion outcome, and then you had Spotify and Adyen creating tens of billions of market cap,  says Botteri, who notes that winners are also coming from a broader base of cities in Europe   12 hubs, not all from London and Tel Aviv. (As on the Midas List Europe, European investors often include Israel s tech-heavy startup scene.)  Now the question is, can Europe generate a $100 billion company? And my answer is, just give it a few years. </p><p>For startups in far-flung places like Tallinn, Estonia, where<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Pipedrive</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>was founded in 2010, or Bucharest, where      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>UiPath got its start</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, the influx of U.S. venture capital counts for more than just money   it means access to former operators who helped scale businesses like Facebook, Google and Slack, introductions to customers in New York or executive hires in San Francisco. And with their stamps of approval comes buzz that can still kickstart a startup s brand recognition, investors say.\u00a0</p><p>But they also come with a risk: heightened pressure to deliver, board members who may be 5,000 miles away, and potentially overheated valuations that can prove onerous should a founder misstep. Sarah Noeckel, a London-based investor at Dawn Capital and the publisher of women-in-tech newsletter Femstreet, has tracked a number of recent seed-stage deals in which a U.S. investor swooped in with an offer too rich for local alternatives to match, for companies that sometimes haven t sold anything yet.  I think there s little validation at this point how it actually plays out for them,  she says.</p><p>For the U.S. investors, there s a clear financial incentive to  swoop in.  On average over the past year, one dollar s worth of equity in a European startup in a Series A funding round would have cost $1.60 in the U.S. for a comparable share, according to the Atomico report. Investors insist that for the most in-demand companies in Europe, such as London-based travel startup Duffel, which<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>raised $30 million</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>from Index Ventures in October, prices already match Silicon Valley highs.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0All the more reason that as U.S. investors hunt in Europe like never before, they re doing so quietly. Though Lightspeed Venture Partners<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>announced</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>its hiring of a London-based partner, Rytis Vitkauskas, in October, other U.S. firms have been on the ground without advertising it publicly. Leaders from NEA, with $20 billion in assets under management, passed through London in recent weeks on a venture capital tour as the firm plans to invest more heavily in Europe moving forward, sources say. Sequoia partners Matt Miller and Pat Grady, meanwhile, have been spotted around town meeting with potential job candidates. (Sequoia s never employed a staffer in Europe before.) NEA and Sequoia declined to comment.</p><p>Many more U.S. investors now pass through London; some even stretch the meaning of what it means to visit a city through months-long stays.  I always used to have to travel to the West Coast to see friends that I made from the show,  says Harry Stebbings, who has interviewed hundreds of U.S. venture capitalists on his popular podcast,  The Twenty Minute VC.   Now, every week I can see three to five VCs in London visiting.  For the past several months, longtime Silicon Valley-based Accel partner Ping Li has lived in London with his family. Asked if he d moved to the city without any public announcement, Li demurred    I would argue that I m spending a lot of time on British Airways,  he says   before insisting he plans to return to California in three to six months.  I don t think you can actually be a top-tier venture capital firm without being global,  he says. Firms without plans for a permanent presence in London are creating buzz among local investors, too. Kleiner Perkins investors Mamoon Hamid and Ilya Fushman have been active in Europe recently, they confirm. Benchmark, the firm behind Snap and Uber, invested in Amsterdam-founded open-source software maker Elastic, which<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>went public in 2018</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, and more recently London-based Duffel and design software maker Sketch, based in The Hague.  Europe s just more in the spotlight now,  partner Chetan Puttagunta says.</p><p>Against the backdrop of Brexit, the inbound interest can feel like a surprise. London-based investors, however, appear to be shrugging off concerns and hoping for the best.  In and of itself, it means nothing,  says Index Ventures  Martin Mignot, a French and British citizen investing in London and No. 7 on the Midas List Europe.  The only real question is around talent, whether it s going to be more difficult for people to come and work in London, but how difficult that is remains to be seen.  Or as his colleague Rimer quips:  Having spent seven years in the U.S., I don t exactly think the political climate of the U.S. was necessarily more welcoming. </p><p>When Rimer attended the Slush conference, a tech conference of 25,000 in Helsinki in November, he brought along a guest: Dylan Field, the CEO of buzzy San Francisco-based design software maker Figma. If Field were European, Index would be leading him around Silicon Valley; instead, with 80% of Figma s business outside of the U.S., Rimer wanted Field to experience the energy of Europe s tech community first-hand. Explains Rimer:  It s just a reflection of the reality today. </p><p>for news on the world s most important entrepreneurs and superstars, expert career advice, and success secrets.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-5ddc33a98ef9f400069abaa8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMW-R951-JBCM-F49N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1588\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 2, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Over the Obama administration's eight years, the technology industry has embedded itself in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president hung out with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and hired the government's first chief tech officer. At the lower levels of officialdom, the revolving door with companies such as Google is spinning ever faster - as it once did with Wall Street.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Politicians have played down their connections to finance since the taxpayer bailout of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.2008.No\">www.2008.No</url> such stigma attaches to tech, for now. But as the Valley steps up its lobbying efforts, with a wish-list that ranges from immigration to rules for driverless cars, some critics warn that similar traps lie in wait: it's not easy for the government to police an industry from which it poaches talent and solicits help with writing laws.</p><p>\"If you're trying to influence government policy on behalf of a corporate sector, it's not better that you do it for the tech industry than for Goldman,\" said Jeff Hauser Saleha Mohsin from the Centre for Economic Policy and Research in Washington.</p><p>Hauser heads the Revolving Door Project, which scrutinises political appointees. Even amid mounting concern over inequality, he says wealthy tech executives and their companies are still considered cool. In other words: It may be hard to persuade people these days that what's good for Goldman Sachs is good for America - but it might just work for Google. The five biggest US tech companies are now the five biggest companies - at least as measured by market value - and they're flexing that muscle.</p><p>Tech firms spent $49m on Washington lobbyists last year, while the five largest banks shelled out $19.7m, data shows. On the personnel front, the Campaign for Accountability, a non-profit group, studied the to-and-fro between government and Google. It found 183 people who worked under Obama through last year were hired by Google, while 58 headed the other way.</p><p>Google is in Washington to \"help policymakers understand our business and the work we do to keep the internet open and fuel economic growth,\" it said. Facebook's goals in the capital include protecting customers, \"explaining how our service works, and maintaining an open internet and a culture of innovation\".</p><p>There have been other high-profile moves out of Washington: former Attorney General Eric Holder took a job at Airbnb, and David Plouffe, Obama's one-time campaign manager, started at Uber in 2014. Persistent rumours have linked Facebook ceo Sheryl Sandberg with the post of Treasury secretary in a Hillary Clinton administration. The view is that tech people are welcome in Washington because they can help make things work better - and help is certainly needed.</p><p>Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary, says the government is shifting toward usnies ing technology the way business has been doing for years. It has set up a coding bootcamp for staff, while data scientists work across federal agencies to mine the archives and help improve transportation projects.</p><p>Megan Smith, the former Google manager who took a job as Obama's chief technology officer in 2014, says the long-term goal is to make government services as smooth a user experience as that offered by Amazon or Dropbox. Collaboration with tech companies pre-dates Obama's creation of a post to oversee it. Zillow Group Inc., the real-estate website, helped the Treasury after the housing- market collapse, according to Stan Humphries, its chief analytics officer.</p><p>\"I was struck by how little data the government had in areas such as price indexes or foreclosures,\" Humphries said. The Seattle-based firm filled the gap, offering its micro-data to Federal Reserve researchers. \"They were soon sucking up every bit of data that we had available,\" said Humphries.</p><p>In Washington, favours typically come at a price though. Tech giants, which are in the habit of buying up smaller compa-and also trying to tie customers to their own platforms, keep a close watch on antitrust policy. In 2013, Google - like Microsoft before it - was threatened with a potentially costly legal battle. Federal Trade Commission staff said the company \"unlawfully maintained its monopoly\" over internet searches, though the 20-month probe was eventually closed.</p><p>\"Competition policy, that's the thing they're most scared of,\" said Barry Lynn, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. \"If a Microsoft-style case was brought against any of these companies, it could totally change their business prospects. It could result in radical changes to the scale and structure of their corporations.\"</p><p>Clinton has talked about tougher antitrust laws. She's also taken aim at shifting profits overseas to avoid taxes.</p><p>Hauser, who previously worked at the Justice Department's antitrust division, said tech firms \"are at the leading edge of tax avoidance because of the ways they've perfected moving their intellectual property overseas\".</p><p>He said Treasury Secretary Jacob J Lew's support for Apple, after it was ordered to pay back-taxes in Ireland, is an unprecedented stance for a Democratic administration. Her Republican rival Donald Trump proposed a tax cut for companies that repatriate profits.</p><p>Then there's the labour market. Trump has taken aim at Apple and others that have shifted jobs overseas. \"We're going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country,\" he said. But the iPhone-maker announced this month it's setting up a second R&amp;D centre in China.</p><p>Big tech simply doesn't hire on the same scale as its heavy-industry predecessors and technology is reshaping the workforce in other ways too, with Silicon Valley favourites like Uber and Taskrabbit at the forefront.</p><p>Beyond the shopping-list of specifics, says Lynn, the industry has one overarching desire: light-touch regulation. \"They want to be left alone,\" he said. \"They want to be allowed to do what they want to do.\"</p><p>And to keep Washington at arm's length, it helps to get close to it first.

The coronavirus has ripped through the global economy, hitting India particularly hard. India's diplomatic spat with China has spilled over into tech, aligning it with the Trump administration's own distrust of Chinese companies. And while India has always been a big draw for US tech firms, the diminishing scope for tech cooperation with China and new threats to their foothold in places such as Hong Kong are giving new importance to the Indian market. </p><p>But the flood of investment also highlights something that has now been true for years: India's digital economy, with more than 700 million internet users and roughly half a billion yet to come online, is simply too big a prize for Big Tech to ignore for long.</p><p>\"People have confidence that, long term, India is going to be a good market, that long term, its regulations are going to be fair and transparent enough,\" said Jay Gullish, who heads tech policy at the advocacy group US-India Business Council. \"I think these are just ... deepening roots that already exist.\" </p><p>The China factor</p><p>Silicon Valley has been largely shut out of China for years, thanks in part to the country's massive censorship mechanism dubbed the Great Firewall. And a controversial new national security law imposed in Hong Kong, where Google and Facebook's services are still accessible due to its relatively unfettered internet, could push them further away. </p><p>The law gives Hong Kong authorities sweeping power to regulate tech platforms, including ordering them to take down posts that threaten China's national security or restricting access to their services. Facebook, Google and Twitter have said they will stop sharing data with the Hong Kong government, while TikTok has exited the city completely. </p><p>\"It is harder and harder to do business with China,\" said Mark Lemley, director of Stanford University's program in law, science and technology. \"There is also a growing sense that doing business with China involves troubling moral compromises.\"</p><p>US distrust of Chinese tech continues to grow. President Donald Trump last week claimed credit for thwarting the expansion plans of Chinese tech company Huawei, and his administration has said it is \"looking at\" banning hugely popular short-form video app TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance. </p><p>It's a step that would only further align the US with India. The Indian government banned TikTok and dozens of Chinese apps last month, after a border clash between the two countries that left 20 Indian soldiers dead led to calls for a boycott of Chinese products. And though India's tech relationship with China still runs deep --- Chinese smartphones dominate the Indian market, and most of India's biggest startups have sizable Chinese investment --- the recent tensions could strengthen India's longstanding tech ties with the US. </p><p>\"India and its Southeast Asian neighbors have tried to balance the two powers by forging greater economic ties with China while holding on to the security umbrella provided by the United States,\" said Ravi Shankar Chaturvedi, research director at the Institute for Business in the Global Context at Tufts University's Fletcher School. \"China, through recent actions, has effectively delivered the US to India for a generation.\"</p><p>Chaturvedi and other experts point out that India and the US have had a longstanding tech relationship, with thousands of Indian engineers working across Silicon Valley and Indians currently at the helm of Google, Microsoft and several other US companies. </p><p>\"There's natural synergy between India and the United States in the digital realm,\" said Gullish, adding that the boost to internet usage from Indian households socializing and working more from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic may further enhance India's appeal as a market. \"It's easy for American companies to look to India for opportunities,\" he said. </p><p>The richest gets richer</p><p>At the same time that US tech companies were eying India's market, Asia's wealthiest man appeared to position himself as a willing gatekeeper.</p><p>Most of the tech investment into India this year --- including all of Facebook's and nearly half of Google's --- has gone into the coffers of companies controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Jio Platforms, the digital subsidiary of Ambani's conglomerate Reliance, has raised more than $20 billion since late April from companies, venture capitalists and sovereign wealth funds looking to use it as a quick conduit to India's massive digital economy. </p><p>Jio launched as a mobile network in 2016 and has quickly amassed nearly 400 million subscribers. With recent forays into e-commerce, digital payments, streaming services and even a Zoom-like video conference platform called JioMeet, Ambani appears to be looking to turn the company into an all-encompassing Indian ecosystem. </p><p>And Silicon Valley clearly wants in. </p><p>\"US tech hasn't been able to penetrate the 'Great Firewall of China' but it has been easier for it to enter the 'Great Paywall of India' created by Jio; all it had to do was pay Reliance the toll fees to enter,\" said Chaturvedi. </p><p>As one of India's biggest companies run by the country's richest man, Reliance has an enormous amount of local influence and is unencumbered by many of the regulations on data storage and e-commerce that have been roadblocks for Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p>\"No global entrant could have managed this as successfully and as quickly on their own as Reliance has,\" Chaturvedi said. \"Much of the ecommerce regulation and data localization laws have been influenced by Reliance.\"</p><p>As the Trump administration increasingly closes the US economy off from the rest of the world, Silicon Valley will look afield to expand its reach, according to Lemley. And India is ripe for the picking. </p><p>\"Much as it pains me to say it, the US isn't nearly as attractive a place for innovation as it was five years ago,\" Lemley said. \"As the Trump administration makes it harder and harder to bring the best and brightest people from around the world to Silicon Valley, I think tech companies may be looking towards a world where we are no longer the center of innovation.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Amazon (AMZN) pledged $1 billion in January, Facebook (FB) invested nearly $6 billion in late April and Google (GOOGL) topped them all last week with a $10 billion commitment. They're part of a wave of investment into India's tech industry this year that's now well over $20 billion, with most of it coming from the United States.    The magnitude and sources of those investments would have seemed highly unlikely, if not outright unthinkable, just months ago when all those technology companies were on a collision course with Indian regulators and tech CEOs were getting the cold shoulder on visits to New Delhi.    A lot has changed since then. The coronavirus has ripped through the global economy, hitting India particularly hard. India's diplomatic spat with China has spilled over into tech, aligning it with the Trump administration's own distrust of Chinese companies. And while India has always been a big draw for US tech firms, the diminishing scope for tech cooperation with China and new threats to their foothold in places such as Hong Kong are giving new importance to the Indian market.    But the flood of investment also highlights something that has now been true for years: India's digital economy, with more than 700 million internet users and roughly half a billion yet to come online, is simply too big a prize for Big Tech to ignore for long.    \"People have confidence that, long term, India is going to be a good market, that long term, its regulations are going to be fair and transparent enough,\" said Jay Gullish, who heads tech policy at the advocacy group US-India Business Council. \"I think these are just ... deepening roots that already exist.\"    The China factor    Silicon Valley has been largely shut out of China for years, thanks in part to the country's massive censorship mechanism dubbed the Great Firewall. And a controversial new national security law imposed in Hong Kong, where Google and Facebook's services are still accessible due to its relatively unfettered internet, could push them further away.    The law gives Hong Kong authorities sweeping power to regulate tech platforms, including ordering them to take down posts that threaten China's national security or restricting access to their services. Facebook, Google and Twitter have said they will stop sharing data with the Hong Kong government, while TikTok has exited the city completely.    \"It is harder and harder to do business with China,\" said Mark Lemley, director of Stanford University's program in law, science and technology. \"There is also a growing sense that doing business with China involves troubling moral compromises.\"    US distrust of Chinese tech continues to grow.

It's a step that would only further align the US with India.

And though India's tech relationship with China still runs deep \u2014 Chinese smartphones dominate the Indian market, and most of India's biggest startups have sizable Chinese investment \u2014 the recent tensions could strengthen India's longstanding tech ties with the US.    \"India and its Southeast Asian neighbors have tried to balance the two powers by forging greater economic ties with China while holding on to the security umbrella provided by the United States,\" said Ravi Shankar Chaturvedi, research director at Tufts University's Institute for Business in the Global Context. \"China, through recent actions, has effectively delivered the US to India for a generation.\"    Chaturvedi and other experts point out that India and the US have had a longstanding tech relationship, with thousands of Indian engineers working across Silicon Valley and Indians currently at the helm of Google, Microsoft and several other US companies.    \"There's natural synergy between India and the United States in the digital realm,\" said Gullish, adding that the boost to internet usage from Indian households socializing and working more from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic may further enhance India's appeal as a market. \"It's easy for American companies to look to India for opportunities,\" he said.

Most of the tech investment into India this year \u2014 including all of Facebook's and nearly half of Google's \u2014 has gone into the coffers of companies controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Jio Platforms, the digital subsidiary of Ambani's conglomerate Reliance, has raised more than $20 billion since late April from companies, venture capitalists and sovereign wealth funds looking to use it as a quick conduit to India's massive digital economy.    Jio launched as a mobile network in 2016 and has quickly amassed nearly 400 million subscribers. With recent forays into e-commerce, digital payments, streaming services and even a Zoom-like video conference platform called JioMeet, Ambani appears to be looking to turn the company into an all-encompassing Indian ecosystem.

As one of India's biggest companies run by the country's richest man, Reliance has an enormous amount of local influence and is unencumbered by many of the regulations on data storage and e-commerce that have been roadblocks for Facebook, Google and Amazon.    \"No global entrant could have managed this as successfully and as quickly on their own as Reliance has,\" Chaturvedi said. \"Much of the ecommerce regulation and data localization laws have been influenced by Reliance.\"    As the Trump administration increasingly closes the US economy off from the rest of the world, Silicon Valley will look afield to expand its reach, according to Lemley. And India is ripe for the picking.    \"Much as it pains me to say it, the US isn't nearly as attractive a place for innovation as it was five years ago,\" Lemley said. \"As the Trump administration makes it harder and harder to bring the best and brightest people from around the world to Silicon Valley, I think tech companies may be looking towards a world where we are no longer the center of innovation.\"   (CNN)                         Source: News Express   Readers Comments  Post comment   No comments yet.

Amazon (AMZN) pledged $1 billion in January, Facebook (FB) invested nearly $6 billion in late April and Google (GOOGL) topped them ...</p><p>San Francisco (CNN Business)Since the start of 2020, the biggest names in US tech have invested around $17 billion in India.   Amazon (AMZN) pledged $1 billion in January, Facebook (FB) invested nearly $6 billion in late April and Google (GOOGL) topped them all last week with a $10 billion commitment. They're part of a wave of investment into India's tech industry this year that's now well over $20 billion, with most of it coming from the United States. The magnitude and sources of those investments would have seemed highly unlikely, if not outright unthinkable, just months ago when all those technology companies were on a collision course with Indian regulators and tech CEOs were getting the cold shoulder on visits to New Delhi. A lot has changed since then. The coronavirus has ripped through the global economy, hitting India particularly hard. India's diplomatic spat with China has spilled over into tech, aligning it with the Trump administration's own distrust of Chinese companies. And while India has always been a big draw for US tech firms, the for tech cooperation with China and new threats to their foothold in places such as Hong Kong are giving new importance to the Indian market. But the flood of investment also highlights something that has now been true for years: India's digital economy, with more than 700 million internet users and roughly half a billion yet to come online, is simply too big a prize for Big Tech to ignore for long. \"People have confidence that, long term, India is going to be a good market, that long term, its regulations are going to be fair and transparent enough,\" said Jay Gullish, who heads tech policy at the advocacy group US-India Business Council. \"I think these are just ... deepening roots that already exist.\" The China factor Silicon Valley has been largely shut out of China for years, thanks in part to the country's massive censorship mechanism dubbed the Great Firewall. And a controversial new national security law imposed in Hong Kong, where Google and Facebook's services are still accessible due to its relatively unfettered internet, could push them further away. The law gives Hong Kong authorities sweeping power to regulate tech platforms, including ordering them to take down posts that threaten China's national security or restricting access to their services. Facebook, Google and Twitter have said they will stop sharing data with the Hong Kong government, while TikTok has exited the city completely. \"It is harder and harder to do business with China,\" said Mark Lemley, director of Stanford University's program in law, science and technology. \"There is also a growing sense that doing business with China involves troubling moral compromises.\" US distrust of Chinese tech continues to grow. President Donald Trump last week claimed credit for thwarting the expansion plans of Chinese tech company Huawei, and his administration has said it is \"looking at\" banning hugely popular short-form video app TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance. It's a step that would only further align the US with India. The Indian government banned TikTok and dozens of Chinese apps last month, after a border clash between the two countries that left 20 Indian soldiers dead led to calls for a boycott of Chinese products. And though India's tech relationship with China still runs deep \u2014 Chinese smartphones dominate the Indian market, and most of India's biggest startups have sizable Chinese investment \u2014 the recent tensions could strengthen India's longstanding tech ties with the US. \"India and its Southeast Asian neighbors have tried to balance the two powers by forging greater economic ties with China while holding on to the security umbrella provided by the United States,\" said Ravi Shankar Chaturvedi, research director at Tufts University's Institute for Business in the Global Context. \"China, through recent actions, has effectively delivered the US to India for a generation.\" Chaturvedi and other experts point out that India and the US have had a longstanding tech relationship, with thousands of Indian engineers working across Silicon Valley and Indians currently at the helm of Google, Microsoft and several other US companies. \"There's natural synergy between India and the United States in the digital realm,\" said Gullish, adding that the boost to internet usage from Indian households socializing and working more from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic may further enhance India's appeal as a market. \"It's easy for American companies to look to India for opportunities,\" he said. The richest gets richer At the same time that US tech companies were eying India's market, Asia's wealthiest man appeared to position himself as a willing gatekeeper. Most of the tech investment into India this year \u2014 including all of Facebook's and nearly half of Google's \u2014 has gone into the coffers of companies controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Jio Platforms, the digital subsidiary of Ambani's conglomerate Reliance, has raised more than $20 billion since late April from companies, venture capitalists and sovereign wealth funds looking to use it as a quick conduit to India's massive digital economy. Jio launched as a mobile network in 2016 and has quickly amassed nearly 400 million subscribers. With recent forays into e-commerce, digital payments, streaming services and even a Zoom-like video conference platform called JioMeet, Ambani appears to be looking to turn the company into an all-encompassing Indian ecosystem. And Silicon Valley clearly wants in. \"US tech hasn't been able to penetrate the 'Great Firewall of China' but it has been easier for it to enter the 'Great Paywall of India' created by Jio; all it had to do was pay Reliance the toll fees to enter,\" said Chaturvedi. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella with Mukesh Ambani during the Microsoft Future Decoded Summit on February 24, 2020 in Mumbai, India. As one of India's biggest companies run by the country's richest man, Reliance has an enormous amount of local influence and is unencumbered by many of the regulations on data storage and e-commerce that have been roadblocks for Facebook, Google and Amazon. \"No global entrant could have managed this as successfully and as quickly on their own as Reliance has,\" Chaturvedi said. \"Much of the ecommerce regulation and data localization laws have been influenced by Reliance.\" As the Trump administration increasingly closes the US economy off from the rest of the world, Silicon Valley will look afield to expand its reach, according to Lemley. And India is ripe for the picking. \"Much as it pains me to say it, the US isn't nearly as attractive a place for innovation as it was five years ago,\" Lemley said. \"As the Trump administration makes it harder and harder to bring the best and brightest people from around the world to Silicon Valley, I think tech companies may be looking towards a world where we are no longer the center of innovation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42624613704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CN-C4P1-JCSC-J4P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It was May 2010 and the future vice presidential candidate was running against Chris Kelly, Facebook's former chief privacy officer, to be the attorney general of California.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the social network still smarting from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">uproar over its new privacy policy in 2009</url>, Harris went for the jugular. \"Was Kelly simply a fox guarding the hen house at Facebook?\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">she asked</url>. \"If Kelly couldn't stand up to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on behalf of Facebook users, how on earth can Californians trust Kelly to go to bat on their behalf?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, however, Silicon Valley luminaries probably breathed a sigh of relief when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">Joe Biden announced her as his running mate</url>. Since Kelly's defeat she has intertwined herself ever more closely with the tech industry, leading many observers to believe that she will be more friend than foe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is despite her strenuous efforts to cast herself as a tech skeptic, such as by demanding that Twitter ban President Donald Trump and hinting that Facebook should be broken up.</p><p>\"I don't think anybody is worried that Kamala Harris is going to get into the White House and take on tech in a huge way,\" says Silicon Valley area Democratic fundraiser Cooper Teboe. </p><p>Indeed, he believes Biden's choice will cement the support of the tech industry's big money donors, who had looked likely to support the Biden ticket anyway but who will now give more promptly and enthusiastically.</p><p>                     Silicon Valley's golden girl                   </p><p>Silicon Valley is a constituency few Democrats can afford to take lightly: solidly liberal, yet affluent enough that you could easily throw a barbecue exclusively for people who can afford to make the maximum allowable donation of $2,800 (\u00a32,144) ten or a hundred times over.</p><p>Biden had a wide range of candidates to pick from, and earlier in the campaign it had looked possible that he would pick renowned anti-Big Tech activist Elizabeth Warren for the role. One of her major policies was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">breaking up Apple and Amazon</url>.</p><p>These donors, explains Teboe, have a \"strain of independence\" in them. \"Many, while they hated Trump, and were certain to vote against Trump and work against Trump, were very curious about who would be the democratic vice president,\" he says. </p><p>\"Some were thrilled at the thought of Elizabeth Warren and then others, probably more in the donor community, were not so thrilled about that. But all pretty unanimously were at least content with the Kamala Harris vice presidential pick.\"</p><p>Harris, after all, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">is a native daughter of the area, born and raised in Oakland</url>, a city just across the bay from San Francisco. She has close connections with the great and good of the industry that has made the region wealthy and powerful. </p><p>California has never sent a Democrat to the presidential election before, so there is some local pride involved. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">But her record also shows a willingness to compromise with Big Tech</url> and very little of the fire shown by Warren and other prominent Democrats.</p><p>                     Friends in high places - and a lot of cash                   </p><p>\"Kamala Harris was attorney general [of California] while Facebook was acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram, and while it was solidifying this monopolistic position that it holds now in social media,\" says Max Moran, a tech policy researcher at the Left-wing Centre for Economic and Policy Research (CESR) in Washington, DC.</p><p>Those mergers are now under the national spotlight, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">with Zuckerberg hauled in front of Congress earlier this month</url> to answer questions about market dominance. Harris's colleagues repeatedly grilled him about emails suggesting he had bought the apps to kill them as competitors - but Harris had the power to regulate him at the time.</p><p>\"Rather than take that obligation seriously she was relying on many of these people for fundraising,\" says Moran. \"She was building relationships with them, helping some of their executives promote their books.\"</p><p>That is a reference to Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's long-serving chief operating officer. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">Harris is a longtime friend</url> and appeared at the company's headquarters in 2015 to give a talk about cyberbullying, publicly praising tech firms' efforts to tackle the issue. </p><p>Meanwhile, Uber and other \"gig economy\" companies such as Airbnb now face a lawsuit from California's current attorney general for failing to comply with a law restricting their use of private contractors, designed explicitly to outlaw their business model. That model emerged during Harris's tenure.</p><p>As it happens, Uber's chief legal officer Tony West is married to Harris's sister, Maya. There is no evidence that the relationship influenced Harris's decisions, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">and she has publicly backed</url>California's anti-Uber law, but will voters see it that way?</p><p>Meanwhile Rebecca Prozan, who managed Harris's breakthrough 2003 campaign to be San Francisco's chief prosecutor, is now Google's head lobbyist for the state of California. </p><p>In financial terms, too, the Valley has been kind to her. According to a database compiled by CESR's \"Revolving Door Project\", listing all known donors associated with major industries who gave a total of $1,000, Harris's Democratic primary campaign attracted money from 37pc of tech donors compared to 22pc for Biden, 22pc for Buttgieg and just 3pc for Elizabeth Warren. </p><p>She also owes more to tech than her rivals, having gotten 28pc of her total purse from tech compared to Biden's 16pc. Donors associated with Google gave her $26,159, Apple $12,450, Microsoft almost $12,000 and Facebook $10,500. </p><p>LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman was one of her biggest \"bundlers\", chaining together $2,800 donations into a formidable financial base. Microsoft's president Brad Smith, Dropbox chief executive Drew Houston, and Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky have all contributed to Harris - although she is probably not so grateful for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">Zapolsky's leaked outburst against a warehouse strike leader in April</url>.</p><p>                     Why some believe she could turn on Big Tech                   </p><p>These days the wind has changed, and Big Tech is Democratic public enemy number two (behind the President, of course). It sorely needs an advocate, so will that be Harris?</p><p>In fact she too has changed her tune, calling last year for \"serious regulation\" of Facebook, and in May she wrote to Zuckerberg pressing him on his misinformation policies, saying Trump adverts redirecting people searching for census information to the president's website were \"a robust unacceptable interference in the census\". </p><p>Jamison Foser, a Democrat political strategist, said: \"Senator Harris's aggressive criticism of social media companies for giving Trump special treatment... demonstrates a rapidly growing understanding in the Democratic Party of the threat these companies pose to both democracy and progressive values.\"</p><p>Many, however, argue that she has been vague enough to leave room for reversals and carefully stopped short of concrete, aggressive proposals. Cooper Teboe thinks that she has not convinced many.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, one staunch tech critic is all but in her corner. Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7038087/Facebooks-privacy-changes-the-real-reason-behind-the-move.htm\">former mentor to Zuckerberg who has now become a persistent thorn in his side</url>, says her sway in the Valley might allow her to administer some tough love.</p><p>\"Think about Lyndon Johnson doing the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, or Nixon going to China,\" he says. \"Biden owes his nominations and eventual election to the communities most harmed by the hate speech and disinformation and conspiracy theories spread over internet platforms.</p><p>\"I'm extremely optimistic that Senator Harris, in her new role, will embrace that challenge... unless she's nuts - and she's not nuts - her future is about doing the right thing for all Americans. I think that will be good for everyone, including those platforms.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-65169131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K7-GFP1-JCJY-G014-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1315\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is faring better, but is only up some 3.3% over the past 30 days:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, said small-caps' recent surge is part of a larger shift by major investors toward a Donald Trump-friendly portfolio of companies and sectors that have more of a U.S. domestic focus. He said those stocks have become popular because of President-elect Trump's economic-nationalist, anti-globalization rhetoric.</p><p>Trump's wish list includes $1 trillion of domestic infrastructure spending, along with aggressive financial-sector deregulation and lots of tax cuts for U.S. corporations. Hogan said the tax cuts will likely have a significant positive impact on small- and mid-sized companies given that they don't have the armies of lawyers that bigger firms use to find loopholes in the current tax code.</p><p>The expert added that higher U.S. government spending and less regulation could provide a big boost for the Russell 2000's large number of infrastructure companies, industrial firms and regional banks. He said regional banks will also likely benefit from the rising interest rates that many expect Trump's policies to spawn.</p><p>Ben Carlson, a director of institutional asset management at Ritholtz Wealth Management in New York, said small-caps also seem like better bets for a Trump era because their underlying businesses mostly focus on the U.S. market. That should insulate them to some extent from any fluctuations in overseas economies or global trading.</p><p>\"They are much less global and much more tied to the U.S. economy,\" Carlson said. \"The United States is a good house in a bad neighborhood as far as developed economies go.\"</p><p>Carlson said small-caps are also less likely to suffer from the strengthening U.S. dollar that markets have seen recently. By contrast, a strong greenback can create problems for big multinationals that depend on exports.</p><p>It's no coincidence that small-caps are rising just as large-cap techs are seeing their share prices fall. Experts say large institutional players are rotating out of large-cap tech names that have done extraordinarily well over the past few years, as those stocks look vulnerable to Trump-infused changes in global demand and trade.</p><p>For instance, market watchers say big companies appear less likely to benefit from corporate-tax cuts, since as noted above, they already have legal teams to find them loopholes. Hogan said America's tech titans could also take a hit if Trump succeeds in cracking down on immigration, reducing Silicon Valley's access to global talent.</p><p>Adam Sarhan of Florida's 50 Park Investments said individual investors can still take advantage of the rotation out of Big Tech and into small-caps, but shouldn't run out and blindly buy small stocks.</p><p>\"Wait for a pullback -- I wouldn't chase anything,\" Sarhan said. \"If you are chasing after a big move up, you inevitably get burned.\"</p><p>He likes the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund</emphasis><br/> , the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iShares Russell 2000 Growth Index ETF</emphasis><br/> and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF</emphasis><br/> .</p><p>Hogan favors infrastructure companies like Dallas-based <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CSW Industrials</emphasis><br/> given Trump's talk of big spending on roads and bridges. But the expert also warns that small-caps are \"very much like biotech -- you have to pick your spots.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCSRM-13909705</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCSRM2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M97-9WN1-F00X-J1XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><timeReceived>3:45 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 TheStreet.com, Inc.

Indeed, around the world, the last two centuries have brought vast improvements in material living standards; billions of people have been lifted from poverty, and life expectancy[1] across income levels has broadly risen. Most of that progress came from capitalist economies.Yet those economies are not without their problems. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the gap between the rich and poor has become intolerably large as business owners and highly educated workers in urban areas have become richer while workers' wages in rural areas have stagnated. </p><p>In most rich countries, more trade has brought a bigger, better variety of goods, but it has also displaced many jobs. With social instability in the form of mass protests, Brexit, the rise of populism, and deep polarization knocking at the capitalist economies' doors, much of the progress of the last several decades is in peril. For some pundits and policymakers, the solution is clear: socialism, which tends to be cited as a method for addressing everything from inequality and injustice to climate change.  Yet the very ills that socialists identify are best addressed through innovation, productivity gains, and better rationing of risk. And capitalism is still far and away the best, if not only, way to generate those outcomes. Today's socialism is difficult to define. Traditionally, the term meant total state ownership of capital, as in the Soviet Union, North Korea, or Maoist China. Nowadays, most people don't take such an extreme view. In Europe, social democracy means the nationalization of many industries and very generous welfare states. And today's rising socialists are rebranding the idea to mean an economic system that delivers all the best parts of capitalism (growth and rising living standards) without the bad (inequality, economic cycles).But no perfect economic system exists; there are always trade-offs\u2014in the most extreme form between total state ownership of capital and unfettered markets without any regulation or welfare state. Today, few would opt for either pole; what modern socialists and capitalists really disagree on is the right level of government intervention.  Modern socialists want more, but not complete, state ownership. They'd like to nationalize certain industries. In the United States, that's health care\u2014a plan supported by Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren (who does not call herself a socialist) and Bernie Sanders (who wears the label proudly). In the United Kingdom, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was trounced at the polls in mid-December, has set his sights on a longer list of industries[2], including the water, energy, and internet providers.Other items on the socialist wish list may include allowing the government to be the primary investor in the economy through massive infrastructure projects that aim to replace fossil fuels with renewables, as Green New Deal socialists have proposed. They've also floated plans that would make the government the employer of a majority of Americans by offering guaranteed well-paid jobs that people can't be fired from. And then there are more limited proposals, including installing more workers on the boards of private companies and instituting national rent controls and high minimum wages.  For their part, modern capitalists want some, but less, state intervention. They are skeptical of nationalization and price controls; they argue that today's economic problems are best addressed by harnessing private enterprise. In the United States, they've argued for more[3] regulation[4] and progressive taxation[5] to help ease inequality, incentives[6] to encourage private firms to use less carbon[7], and a more robust welfare state[8] through tax credits. Over the past 15 years, meanwhile, capitalist Europeans have instituted reforms to improve labor market flexibility by making it easier to hire and fire people, and there have been attempts to reduce the size of pensions. No economic system is perfect, and the exact right balance between markets and the state may never be found. But there are good reasons to believe that keeping capital in the hands of the private sector, and empowering its owners to make decisions in the pursuit of profit, is the best we've got. One reason to trust markets is that they are better at setting prices than people. If you set prices too high, many a socialist government has found, citizens will be needlessly deprived of goods. Set them too low, and there will be excessive demand and ensuing shortages. This is true for all goods, including health care and labor. And there is little reason to believe that the next batch of socialists in Washington or London would be any better at setting prices than their predecessors. In fact, government-run health care systems in Canada and European countries are plagued by long wait times. A 2018 Fraser Institute study[9] cites a median wait time of 19.8 weeks to see a specialist physician in Canada. Socialists may argue that is a small price to pay for universal access, but a market-based approach can deliver both coverage and responsive service. A full government takeover isn't the only option, nor is it the best one.Beyond that, markets are also good at rationing risk. Fundamentally, socialists would like to reduce risk\u2014protect workers from any personal or economywide shock. That is a noble goal, and some reduction through better functioning safety nets is desirable. But getting rid of all uncertainty\u2014as state ownership of most industries would imply\u2014is a bad idea. Risk is what fuels growth. People who take more chances tend to reap bigger rewards; that's why the top nine names on the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans[10]are not heirs to family dynasties but are self-made entrepreneurs who took a leap to build new products and created many jobs in the process.Some leftist economists like Mariana Mazzucato argue[11] that governments might be able to step in and become laboratories for innovation. But that would be a historical anomaly; socialist-leaning governments have typically been less innovative than others. After all, bureaucrats and worker-corporate boards have little incentive to upset the status quo or compete to build a better widget. And even when government programs have spurred innovation\u2014as in the case of the internet\u2014it took the private sector[12] to recognize the value and create a market.  And that brings us to a third reason to believe in markets: productivity. Some economists, such as Robert Gordon[13], have looked to today's economic problems and suggested that productivity growth\u2014the engine that fueled so much of the progress of the last several decades\u2014is over. In this telling, the resources, products, and systems that underpin the world's economy are all optimized, and little further progress is possible. But that is hard to square with reality. Innovation helps economies do more with fewer resources\u2014increasingly critical to addressing climate change, for example\u2014which is a form of productivity growth. And likewise, many of the products and technologies people rely on every day did not exist a few years ago. These goods make inaccessible services more available and are changing the nature of work, often for the better. Such gains are made possible by capitalist systems that encourage invention and growing the pie, not by socialist systems that are more concerned with how the existing pie is cut. It is far too soon, in other words, to write off productivity.Here, it is worth considering the lessons of a previous productivity boom: the Industrial Revolution. As the economist Joel Mokyr has shown, it took new innovations like the steam engine more than 100 years[14] to appear in productivity estimates. The same could be happening today with smartphones and the internet. Meanwhile, even as that upheaval transformed the human experience, creating a more comfortable existence for most everyone, it was also messy and disruptive. The early part of that innovative cycle\u2014like others since\u2014displaced existing workers while the gains flowed to the owners of capital first, causing social instability.  This time around, the effects may end up being less wrenching: The divisions between owners of capital and workers are not as clear as they used to be. More Americans than ever own stock[15] through their workplace retirement accounts. Stock ownership is on the rise in many non-U.S. capitalist economies, too. And several other countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, also offer retirement accounts, making their citizens shareholders as well. Unlike 200 years ago, workers' interests are already more aligned with those of management. Stock ownership in retirement accounts hints at the kinds of market-friendly policies that can share wealth while preserving innovation and risk-taking. In the United States, there is room to make taxes more progressive, especially when it comes to estate taxes, and to close tax loopholes[16] that make it easier for companies to exploit the system. The social safety net could be expanded to include jobs retraining, an enhanced earned income tax credit, and grants to innovate or work remotely in smaller cities or more rural areas. And the health care industry is indeed in need of reform.More generally, capitalism can be made more inclusive, and government programs can help smooth its rough edges. But none of these changes require governments to take over entire industries. Depending on the market, the reform could be a less intrusive government option, subsidy, or sometimes just better accountability. Most fundamentally, inequality is tolerable if the poor have a shot at becoming rich, too. That shot has never been so great as the American dream in particular promised, but there is little evidence[17] that economic mobility has actually gotten worse in recent years. Still, to avoid greater instability\u2014and to ensure the greatest possible buy-in for the capitalist system\u2014today's business and political leaders can do more to make sure everyone at least has a chance to roll the dice. Here, education reform and development of rural areas are necessary to close the gap. And that's not socialism\u2014it's building off capitalism and making better use of today's and tomorrow's workers.  This article appears in the Winter 2020 print issue.

The transition to the cloud is an industry game-changer and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella got it right when he finally succeeded showman Steve Balmer at the helm of the empire of Redmond five years ago. The result? Mister Softy's share price has risen from 30 to 90 in the Age of Satya. There is nothing hotter than a software cloud/hybrid cloud/cloud security startup on Wall Street, as the 100 per cent-plus pop of Jay Chaudhry's Zscaler (number theory/cryptography are my latest obsessions, other than the evolutionary biology of the human brain and real estate!) up 100 per cent in a single day on its Nasdaq birth. The Microsofts, Oracles, Salesforce.coms and SAP's of the world are natural acquirers of Silicon Valley's hottest cloud startups in Silicon Valley. The repatriation of capital and higher capex/enterprise spending in the US means the pipeline of software takeovers, mergers and acquisitions will only accelerate.</p><p/><p>My friends accuse me of often going gaga over software companies that trade at high valuations relative to the S&amp;P 500 index and my counter-argument is that high multiples reflect 20-25 per cent recurrent revenue gain potential, something very rare outside the digital world. This is the reason Microsoft trades at 24 times earnings with its shares on fire while Oracle has been dead money at 16 times forward earnings. Pour quoi? The difference between Satya's successful and Mark Hurd's botched cloud transition strategy.</p><p>My ideal sweet spot (for risk capital, not widows, orphans or those whose brains are closed to new ideas!) has been either unicorns in the D-stage financing rounds or Nasdaq companies in the $4-$8 billion market cap stage. Take Paycom Software. Paycom has successfully disrupted the payroll processing models of Paychex and ADP. So, this puppy trades at a nosebleed 100 times earnings but the shares have doubled from 58 to 118 in the past year alone. Paycom has been the planet's preeminent software as a service payroll processor that is increasing market share, taking revenue growth in one of corporate America's highest margin outsourced markets. The next hot payroll software IPO? Ceridian Software.</p><p>Oracle's third-quarter earnings report was a disaster. The House of Larry (Elison) was literally the worst-performing stock on the S&amp;P 500 index one day a month ago. An earnings beat was not enough for Wall Street when Oracle missed its consensus cloud growth estimates. This makes Oracle dead money till the next earnings report. The rerating case I hoped for will not happen until Oracle puts some sizzle in its cloud transition crystal ball.</p><p>Global IT spending could well rise to $4 trillion in the next 12 months, a testament to both synchronised global economic growth and the sheer transformative potential of cloud computing. Gartner even estimates enterprise software will be Big Tech's highest growth area in 2018 and revenues will rise to $391 billion in 2018. The licence, on premise model is toast and service could well be a $1 trillion revenue jackpot.</p><p>To me (and yes, I am biased. I am neurologically programmed to think conditionally and hypothetically as an investor), cloud enterprise software will be the best-performing investment theme in the next five years, even though momentum investors will be periodically Russian roulette as Wall Street braces for higher interest rate and trade/geopolitics shifts. So who are the rising starts in the Valley to leverage this theme? Marc Benioff's Salesforce.com.</p><p>Salesforce.com has been a four-bagger since 2013. This cloud software colossus has revenue guidance of $12.50 billion for next year. This means its fairy tale 25 per cent revenue growth metrics will continue, with deferred revenue growth at least 20 per cent. Would I buy Salesforce at 124 for new money? Absolutely not. Yet if M. Market has one of his periodic tantrums and CRM falls below triple-digits, I will not hesitate to buy one of history's most fascinating and profitable cloud software platforms.</p><p>Germany's enterprise application software and services firm SAP. I believe the stock market undervalues the emerging markets growth potential of S/4 Hana. After all, this firm has 900 staff in its Dubai Internet City regional office and established an innovation lab in Dubai. SAP is that rare breed.

Shortly after introducing Apple One on Tuesday, Spotify criticized the bundle, calling it \"anti-competitive.\" Spotify called on regulators to look into Apple One. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The iPhone maker already faces some antitrust scrutiny: Fortnite maker Epic Games is currently suing Apple and Google in the United States after Fortnite was removed from their app stores, claiming both app stores are monopolies. Google and Apple have said Fortnite was removed for violating their app store policies, and Apple countersued Epic. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">European regulators in June announced formal antitrust investigations into the Apple App Store's in-app purchase policy and its Apple Pay system, following complaints from Spotify and Rakuten. In response to the investigations in Europe, Apple said it was \"disappointing\" to see the Commission advance \"baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride, and don't want to play by the same rules as everyone else.\"</p><p>Regarding the new Apple One bundle, Spotify said: \"Once again, Apple is using its dominant position and unfair practices to disadvantage competitors and deprive consumers by favoring its own services,\" according to a Tuesday statement from a spokesperson.</p><p>If left unchecked, Spotify says Apple's bundling of services will harm competitors, and could limit choices for consumers. </p><p>Apple says customers can still \"discover and enjoy alternatives to every one of Apple's services.\" </p><p>\"We're introducing Apple One because it is a great value for customers and a simple way to access the full range of Apple's subscription services,\" an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business. \"We'll be recommending the Apple One plan that saves you the most money based on the subscriptions you already have. It's perfect for anyone who loves any of our services and wants to get more for less, and it's especially great for families. Also select services included in Apple One are available to enjoy on non-Apple devices, and you can cancel anytime.\"</p><p>Legal experts say Spotify's argument would likely work something like this: By bundling Apple Music with other Apple services --- including various combinations of iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+ and Apple News+ --- Apple could make it cheaper and easier for customers to choose Apple Music over other music subscription services like Spotify. Individual plans for Apple Music alone and Spotify both start at $9.99 per month (they also both offer $4.99 student plans), and the basic Apple One bundle starts at $14.95 per month and includes two other subscription services and 50 gigabytes of storage. So, with the bundle, consumers will get three more services for just $5 extra per month.</p><p>Some legal experts believe Spotify's claim could be legitimate enough to garner the attention of antitrust regulators. But antitrust law is complicated, and it would be a difficult fight for regulators to win. </p><p>\"In both Europe and the United States, there is definitely a theory of liability under which a monopolist could be sued for tying or bundling different services together,\" said Chistopher Sagers, professor of law at Cleveland State University. \"It's difficult though --- especially under US law, it's extremely difficult to prove that tying or bundling is illegal.\"</p><p>Is anything wrong with bundling? </p><p>Looking at the services bundle alone, a successful antitrust complaint would have to prove, first, that Apple has significant market share (likely greater than 30%) in any one of the services being bundled, according to University of Tennessee College of Law professor Maurice Stucke. Because Apple's services are still available individually outside of the bundle, Stucke said regulators would then likely have to demonstrate that Apple had made the bundle pricing so compelling that consumers would almost certainly want to buy the bundle, even if they didn't necessarily care for all the services in it.</p><p>In that case, the argument goes, consumers would be discouraged from buying third-party companies' services. </p><p>By that analysis, a case against Apple probably wouldn't succeed. Although Apple has not released subscriber numbers for all of its services, experts believe it's unlikely any of its services in the bundle hold significant enough market share. As for the second piece, consumers can still buy Apple services individually, and a few dollars' worth of savings is probably not enough to get them to buy the bundle if they don't actually want all the subscriptions, Sagers said. </p><p>Since Apple isn't requiring consumers to buy services in the bundle, Sagers said courts are more likely to look at Apple One as an example of price competition --- which isn't illegal. </p><p>\"It's not that you're requiring people to buy more stuff, it's that you're making your products cheaper so people will pick them,\" Sagers said. </p><p>Apple's massive iOS advantage</p><p>Apple's massive iOS platform, which is used on nearly 1 billion mobile devices around the world, gives it a natural advantage over other app makers: Apple pre-installs its own services on its devices. By also offering a bundle that could save consumers money on those pre-installed services, legal experts say Apple could make choosing its services both easier and more compelling than installing a rival app.</p><p>\"In the Spotify context, since Apple controls iOS, by offering a bundle of these services, it's going to make it too easy to take Apple Music, and suddenly the market for these streaming services will be distorted,\" Ketan Jhaveri, co-founder and president of Bodhala and former Justice Department antitrust attorney, said. </p><p>That argument hearkens back to the US government's antitrust case against Microsoft in the late 1990s, in which Microsoft was charged with making it harder for consumers to access other companies' browsers because Internet Explorer came pre-installed on Windows devices. In that case, a judge found that Microsoft held monopoly power in the PC operating systems market, and that its actions had harmed consumers. Microsoft agreed to a settlement curbing some of its practices that the government had said excluded competitors.</p><p>Still, Apple could have a strong defense. It could make the argument that its iOS platform is smaller than Google's Android operating system, and people can still easily download Spotify from the App Store. </p><p>Apple could have another potential defense: The bundle is good for its customers.</p><p>\"We want to make it easy for everyone to discover and enjoy\" Apple's services, Lori Malm, the company's director of services said at Tuesday's event. \"It's everything for the entire family, for one incredible price.\"</p><p>In the United States, arguments that something saves consumers money are often successful in staving off an antitrust case, Jhaveri said. \"That's an argument that wins everything. If it's better for consumers, anything is possible in the United States.\"</p><p>Broader concerns about Big Tech</p><p>As concern grows about Silicon Valley giants' power, in many cases, antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech companies centers on their ability to use their massive platforms to preference their own products and services above those from other companies. </p><p>At a Congressional hearing in July, for example, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was questioned about whether the company uses data from third party sellers on its platform to inform its own private-label product decisions --- a key concern over the company's approach to competition. Bezos admitted that the company may have engaged in such a practice.</p><p>And the Justice Department investigation of Google has included probes into whether making Google Search the default on Android devices (the world's largest mobile operating system) disadvantages other search engines. Google has said it is cooperating with investigators, and that it is focused \"on providing services that help consumers, support thousands of businesses, and enable increased choice and competition.\"</p><p>\"There's all this underlying concern about self-preferencing,\" said University of Tennessee's Stucke, who also recently co-authored \"Competition Overdose.\" \"You want them to innovate, but once they start competing with others on their platforms, then there's this incentive for them to favor themselves and disadvantage rivals.\"</p><p>In recent years, such claims have been more successful in the European Union than in the United States, which may explain why Spotify has thus far taken its claims there. </p><p>\"The EU has become the dominant regime in antitrust,\" Jhaveri said. \"They take a nuanced view which is: If you drive out all the competitors, ultimately something will be bad for consumers.\"</p><p>But given the Justice Department's recent attention to antitrust concerns surrounding Big Tech, Jhaveri said Spotify could be thinking: \"Hey, there may be an audience with the Trump administration right now.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Apple's Fitness+ wants to take on Peloton with at-home workouts But not everyone is celebrating the new offering \u2014 namely, Apple Music competitor Spotify. Shortly after introducing Apple One on Tuesday, Spotify criticized the bundle, calling it \"anti-competitive.\" Spotify called on regulators to look into Apple One. The iPhone maker already faces some antitrust scrutiny: Fortnite maker Epic Games is currently suing Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) in the United States after Fortnite was removed from their app stores, claiming both app stores are monopolies. Google and Apple have said Fortnite was removed for violating their app store policies, and Apple countersued Epic. European regulators in June into the Apple App Store's in-app purchase policy and its Apple Pay system, following complaints from Spotify (SPOT) and Rakuten (RKUNF). In response to the investigations in Europe, Apple said it was \"disappointing\" to see the Commission advance \"baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride, and don't want to play by the same rules as everyone else.\" Regarding the new Apple One bundle, Spotify said: \"Once again, Apple is using its dominant position and unfair practices to disadvantage competitors and deprive consumers by favoring its own services,\" according to a Tuesday statement from a spokesperson. If left unchecked, Spotify says Apple's bundling of services will harm competitors, and could limit choices for consumers. Apple says customers can still \"discover and enjoy alternatives to every one of Apple's services.\" \"We're introducing Apple One because it is a great value for customers and a simple way to access the full range of Apple's subscription services,\" an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business. \"We'll be recommending the Apple One plan that saves you the most money based on the subscriptions you already have.

Since Apple isn't requiring consumers to buy services in the bundle, Sagers said courts are more likely to look at Apple One as an example of price competition \u2014 which isn't illegal. \"It's not that you're requiring people to buy more stuff, it's that you're making your products cheaper so people will pick them,\" Sagers said. Apple's massive iOS advantage Apple's massive iOS platform, which is used on nearly 1 billion mobile devices around the world, gives it a natural advantage over other app makers: Apple pre-installs its own services on its devices. By also offering a bundle that could save consumers money on those pre-installed services, legal experts say Apple could make choosing its services both easier and more compelling than installing a rival app. \"In the Spotify context, since Apple controls iOS, by offering a bundle of these services, it's going to make it too easy to take Apple Music, and suddenly the market for these streaming services will be distorted,\" Ketan Jhaveri, co-founder and president of Bodhala and former Justice Department antitrust attorney, said. That argument hearkens back to the US government's antitrust case against Microsoft in the late 1990s, in which Microsoft was charged with making it harder for consumers to access other companies' browsers because Internet Explorer came pre-installed on Windows devices. In that case, a judge found that Microsoft held monopoly power in the PC operating systems market, and that its actions had harmed consumers. Microsoft agreed to a settlement curbing some of its practices that the government had said excluded competitors. Still, Apple could have a strong defense. It could make the argument that its iOS platform is smaller than Google's Android operating system, and people can still easily download Spotify from the App Store. Apple could have another potential defense: The bundle is good for its customers. \"We want to make it easy for everyone to discover and enjoy\" Apple's services, Lori Malm, the company's director of services said at Tuesday's event. \"It's everything for the entire family, for one incredible price.\" In the United States, arguments that something saves consumers money are often successful in staving off an antitrust case, Jhaveri said. \"That's an argument that wins everything. If it's better for consumers, anything is possible in the United States.\" Broader concerns about Big Tech As concern grows about Silicon Valley giants' power, in many cases, antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech companies centers on their ability to use their massive platforms to preference their own products and services above those from other companies. At a Congressional hearing in July, for example, Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos was questioned about whether the company uses data from third party sellers on its platform to inform its own private-label product decisions \u2014 a key concern over the company's approach to competition. Bezos admitted that the company may have engaged in such a practice. And the Justice Department investigation of Google has included probes into whether making Google Search the default on Android devices (the world's largest mobile operating system) disadvantages other search engines. Google has said it is cooperating with investigators, and that it is focused \"on providing services that help consumers, support thousands of businesses, and enable increased choice and competition.\" \"There's all this underlying concern about self-preferencing,\" said University of Tennessee's Stucke, who also recently co-authored \"Competition Overdose.\" \"You want them to innovate, but once they start competing with others on their platforms, then there's this incentive for them to favor themselves and disadvantage rivals.\" In recent years, such claims have been more successful in the European Union than in the United States, which may explain why Spotify has thus far taken its claims there. \"The EU has become the dominant regime in antitrust,\" Jhaveri said. \"They take a nuanced view which is: If you drive out all the competitors, ultimately something will be bad for consumers.\" But given the Justice Department's recent attention to antitrust concerns surrounding Big Tech, Jhaveri said Spotify could be thinking: \"Hey, there may be an audience with the Trump administration right now.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43115470307</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W9-F3S1-JCSC-J4MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1564\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 19, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Those are the people who really make a tech company, and they are \"worth their weight in gold,\" he said. \"A great engineer can be worth ten times a 'regular' engineer, or 30, 40, 50, or 100 times,\" Costolo said. </p><p>\"These are the very special engineers that the top companies are seeking. That's the game.\" What makes these top engineers so special is not just that they have a mastery of engineering principals and technical skills, but more they think creatively and\u00a0have\u00a0solved problems no one has\u00a0solved before, Costolo said. They are the Einsteins of the tech engineer world. Costolo knows something about building a tech company. He's credited with\u00a0steering Twitter through its breathtaking growth phase and its spectacular IPO. After stepping down as CEO when the pitchforks came out over Twitter's slowing growth,\u00a0he's back in the game of building a young tech company, working at health tech startup Chorus. Chorus has created\u00a0an app that's designed to motivate users\u00a0to workout, train, and accomplish big fitness goals. The focus on rock-star engineers\u00a0helps to explain Silicon Valley's continual complaints about there being a talent crunch\u00a0even as big tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter are swimming in\u00a0job applicants. Big companies are most concerned with finding top talent, not just\u00a0people who know a particular programming language. Tech companies have gotten so aggressive about finding those rocks starts they've begun prowling\u00a0colleges, or sometimes even high schools, Costolo said. And when they find one, they pull out all the stops to woo them. Costolo told the story\u00a0of\u00a0how he, as Twitter's CEO, personally recruited a senior from Princeton. While on the phone with her, he realized he wasn't even the only CEO of a big internet company who had called her. Wait, CEOs of multi-billion companies are calling up college seniors? \"This was not happening when I was in college,\" Costolo said.\u00a0 As the competition for top engineers has ramped up, those programmers\u00a0have also gotten more savvy about negotiating their pay packages, particularly their stock options, he said. As you might expect, all this fawning and those large paychecks can have their\u00a0consequences. Some of these folks develop big egos. For all the talk of Valley companies wanting to\u00a0build great corporate cultures, they often look the other way when it comes to the personalities of these star engineers, Costolo said. \"A lot these companies will say, 'No brilliant jerks,' and generally, they would prefer not to have brilliant jerks, but when you're trying to get world-class engineers, there's a lot you'll overlook,\" he said. That could explain a lot about the state of Silicon Valley's these days. Many companies are touting themselves as warm and tolerant places. But we've seen repeated stories from inside particular ones claiming they have instituted a \"culture of fear\" [2]or a \"bruising culture\" [3]or \"aggressive culture[4].\" If some of the most valuable employees are actually \"brilliant jerks,\" that can't help but impact the workplace.NOW WATCH: Google just showed off an incredible camera app that identifies real-world objects[5]See Also:

Adrian Wooldridge considered it inevitable that executives at Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft would be seen by the public in the same malign fashion as bankers and oil barons - symbols of a greedy nerd version of avaricious capitalism.</p><p> Wooldridge was right about the backlash - but he probably didn't count on how broad an indictment critics of the tech giants would bring. It was predictable that big tech companies would stand accused of operating in monopolistic ways and of stealthily monetizing information about individuals acquired from their online activities.</p><p> But it's not just these practices that have poked holes in Silicon Valley's bubble of public regard and admiration. It's also how the tech giants have behaved in other ways.</p><p> With the release of its iPhone X, Apple joined Facebook and Google as companies pursuing facial recognition technologies that portend an end to old concepts of privacy. Despite their insistence otherwise, those firms and Microsoft have been called de facto silent partners to U.S. intelligence agencies' attempts to vacuum up information from people around the world without their consent. And despite all the benefits they bring, Facebook and Google are villains to both sides of the culture wars.</p><p> They're accused of enforcing left-wing speech codes on acceptable commentary and enabling the far right to spread election-skewing \"fake news\" and bigotry. ProPublica provided a new example Thursday when it showed Facebook provided tools for advertisers to reach anti-Semitic hate groups.</p><p> Now the backlash may be moving beyond rhetoric. In June, European Union regulators slammed Google with a record $2.7 billion fine for seeking to profit by manipulating online search requests.</p><p> In the U.S., the traditional American fear of giant corporations has begun to manifest itself. The same impulse that led to the break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&amp;T in 1982 is flaring as awareness grows of Google's and Facebook's hegemony in advertising and the realization sets in that Amazon may destroy more American jobs than China.</p><p>Google's troubles continued with an Aug. 30 report in The New York Times that Eric Schmidt of Google's parent company Alphabet had pressured the New America Foundation think tank - which Google has supported financially - to push out scholar Barry Lynn and his Open Markets research team. Lynn's sin? Publicly applauding the EU's fine against Google. Such bullying will haunt Google - at least if the anti-monopoly backlash plays out according to the traditional American script.</p><p> But that's a huge if. Standard Oil and AT&amp;T had monopolistic control of gasoline supplies and telephone service, respectively - major bills most American households pay. Google's and Facebook's chief services are addictive - and free.</p><p> Still, as everyday life makes clear, Americans are stirred up. The Trump and Sanders wings of the two largest political parties want and expect dramatic change. If they get their way, the most powerful forces in this country are likely to feel the fallout. And that is a category that very much includes Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-170919116261072</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28975E2789B7EE NWBKNY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHG-NSB1-DXVP-V09F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"548\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Johnson Newspaper Corporation<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Adrian Wooldridge considered it inevitable that executives at Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft would be seen by the public in the same malign fashion as bankers and oil barons \u2013 symbols of a greedy nerd version of avaricious capitalism. </p><p><br/>Wooldridge was right about the backlash \u2013 but he probably didn't count on how broad an indictment critics of the tech giants would bring. It was predictable that big tech companies would stand accused of operating in monopolistic ways and of stealthily monetising information about individuals acquired from their online activities. <br/>But it's not just these practices that have poked holes in Silicon Valley's bubble of public regard and admiration. It's also how the tech giants have behaved in other ways. <br/>With the release of its iPhone X, Apple joined Facebook and Google as companies pursuing facial recognition technologies that portend an end to old concepts of privacy. Despite their insistence otherwise, those firms and Microsoft have been called de facto silent partners to US intelligence agencies' attempts to vacuum up information from people around the world without their consent. And despite all the benefits they bring, Facebook and Google are villains to both sides of the culture wars. <br/>They're accused of enforcing left-wing speech codes on acceptable commentary and enabling the far right to spread election-skewing \"fake news\" and bigotry. ProPublica provided a new example Thursday when it showed Facebook provided tools for advertisers to reach anti-Semitic hate groups. <br/>Now the backlash may be moving beyond rhetoric. In June, European Union regulators slammed Google with a record $2.7bn fine for seeking to profit by manipulating online search requests. <br/>In the US, the traditional American fear of giant Corps has begun to manifest itself. The same impulse that led to the break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&amp;T in 1982 is flaring as awareness grows of Google's and Facebook's hegemony in advertising and the realization sets in that Amazon may destroy more American jobs than China. <br/>Google's troubles continued with an Aug. 30 report in The New York Times that Eric Schmidt of Google's parent company Alphabet had pressured the New America Foundation think tank \u2013 which Google has supported financially \u2013 to push out scholar Barry Lynn and his Open Markets research team. Lynn's sin? Publicly applauding the EU's fine against Google. Such bullying will haunt Google \u2013 at least if the anti-monopoly backlash plays out according to the traditional American script. But that's a huge if. Standard Oil and AT&amp;T had monopolistic control of gasoline supplies and telephone service, respectively \u2013 major bills most American households pay. Google's and Facebook's chief services are addictive \u2013 and free. <br/>Still, as everyday life makes clear, Americans are stirred up. The Trump and Sanders wings of the two largest political parties want and expect dramatic change. If they get their way, the most powerful forces in this country are likely to feel the fallout. And that is a category that very much includes Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.</p><p><br/>\u00a9 Gulf Times Newspaper 2017 Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Adrian Wooldridge considered it inevitable that executives at Amazon, Apple, Face book, Google and Microsoftwould be seen by the public in the same malign fashion as bankers and oil barons - symbols of a greedy nerd version of avaricious capitalism.</p><p> Wooldridge was right about the backlash - but he probably didn't count on how broad an indictment critics of the tech giants would bring. It was predictable that big tech companies would stand accused of operating in monopolistic ways and of stealthily monetizing information about individuals acquired from their online activities.</p><p> But it's not just these practices that have poked holes in Silicon Valley's bubble of public regard and admiration. It's also how the tech giants have behaved in other ways.</p><p> With the release of its I Phone X, Apple joined Face book and Googleas companies pursuing facial recognition technologies that portend an end to old concepts of privacy. Despite their insistence otherwise, those firms and Microsoft have been called de facto silent partners to U.S. intelligence agencies' attempts to vacuum up information from people around the world without their consent. And despite all the benefits they bring, Face book and Googleare villains to both sides of the culture wars.</p><p> They're accused of enforcing left-wing speech codes on acceptable commentary and enabling the far right to spread election-skewing \"fake news\" and bigotry. Pro Publica provided a new example Thursday when it showed Face book provided tools for advertisers to reach anti-Semitic hate groups.</p><p> Now the backlash may be moving beyond rhetoric. In June, European Union regulators slammed Googlewith a record $2.7 billion fine for seeking to profit by manipulating online search requests.</p><p> In the U.S., the traditional American fear of giant corporations has begun to manifest itself. The same impulse that led to the break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 and AT &amp; T in 1982 is flaring as awareness grows of Google's and Face book's hegemony in advertising and the realization sets in that Amazon may destroy more American jobs than China.</p><p>Google's troubles continued with an Aug. 30 report in The New York Times that Eric Schmidt of Google's parent company Alphabet had pressured the New America Foundation think tank - which Googlehas supported financially - to push out scholar Barry Lynn and his Open Markets research team. Lynn's sin? Publicly applauding the EU's fine against Google. Such bullying will haunt Google-at least if the anti-monopoly backlash plays out according to the traditional American script.</p><p> But that's a huge if. Standard Oil and AT &amp; T had monopolistic control of gasoline supplies and telephone service, respectively - major bills most American households pay. Google's and Face book's chief services are addictive - and free.</p><p> Still, as everyday life makes clear, Americans are stirred up. The Trump and Sanders wings of the two largest political parties want and expect dramatic change. If they get their way, the most powerful forces in this country are likely to feel the fallout. And that is a category that very much includes Amazon, Apple, Face book, Google and Microsoft.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMO-ae53877e7b162af83438e33f403fa126</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A1ACCD8F334 NWBKMO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PM6-YTR1-DXVP-V059-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401953</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Kirksville Daily Express<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

But neither does the commonplace idea that smaller, nimbler and more innovativestartups[1] will eventually overtake their bigger, clunkier and less dynamic rivals. That might have been true a quarter century ago, but today's big corporations are no longer succumbing to the debilitating effects of old age, and small firms are having trouble just reaching maturity, according to data presented in a recent article in theHarvard Business Review[2].As recently as the mid-1990s, that old model has begun to break down. </p><p>Big firms are maintaining their dominance and they are doing so through increased spending on research and development (R...]), the primary driver of an enterprise's growth and performance, according to Dartmouth Professor of Management Vijay Govindarajan, NYU Professor of Accounting and Finance Baruch Lev, and University of Calgary Associate Professors of Business Anup Srivastava and Luminita Enache. What It Means for Investors  The traditional idea was that as firms reach a more mature stage of theirlife cycle[4] they would then focus more of their time and energy on standardizing processes to maximize operational efficiencies and would hand over a greater amount of their profits to shareholders. Startups, by contrast, are supposed to be dynamic, not standardized, and aren't expected to be profitable as their focus on growth and coming up with the next must-have product or service requires plunging more cash than they earn into R#38;D.This model that contrasts the priorities of firms at different stages of their lifecycle has been used to explain why, although inventing most of the technologies used in personal computing today, Xerox Holdings Corp. (XRX[5]) is not one of the largest computing companies. Or why the inventor of the digital camera, Eastman Kodak Co. (KODK[6]), had to file for bankruptcy in 2012, and why Nokia Corp. (NOK[7]; ADR), an early pioneer of the smartphone, ended up losing significant market share to Apple Inc. (AAPL[8]) and its iPhone, according toForbes[9].However, over the last 25 years, that model has grown increasingly tenuous. The difference between the medianmarket values[10] of the largest public firms (top 30% based on market value of equity) and those of the smallest public firms (bottom 30%) widened to $3.5 billion in 1981 dollars (or $8.4 billion in 2017 dollars). From 1981 to the mid-1990s, that gap remained between $0.3 billion and $0.6 billion. The widening gap is not only because of stronger performance from the big firms, but also stagnation amongst their smaller rivals.The 'small size trap' is the label the authors are using to describe the recent difficulty that small firms are having in their attempts to grow into mid-size companies or large corporations. Before 2000, around 15% to 20% of small companies were able to make the size jump, but the percentage doing so by 2017 was cut in half. Meanwhile, the percentage of large companies that have been able to maintain their size status has increased from 75-80% before 2000 to 89% more recently.On a profitability basis, large companies are also outperforming smaller companies by wider and wider margins. The difference in the median return on operating assets between large and small firms in the 1990s was 15%. Since then, the gap has doubled to around 30-35%. From 2015 to 2017, both the median return on operating assets and medianprofit margin[11] turned negative for small firms. In terms of annual losses, just 10-15% of large companies have reported negative earnings in recent years, while a whopping 60-65% of their smaller competitors did so.One of the major noticeable differences driving the growing wedge between big and small firms is the increasing gap in the R...pend between the two groups. That gap has grown from less than $20 million in the 1980s to nearly $120 million in 2017 (in inflation adjusted 1981 dollars). With large firms spending an average $330 million on R...n 2017 versus an average of just $6 million for small firms, the ability to be innovative appears to be reserved for an exclusive club of big spenders.  Looking Ahead  One of the reasonsmonopolistic[12] firms are supposed to be bad is that the lack of competition reduces their incentive to innovate, resulting in a stagnant economy. But while there may be good reasons to be concerned about the dominant size of big tech companies like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[13]), Facebook Inc. (FB[14]), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL[15]), and Apple, all of which are now facing regulatory scrutiny, the recent findings highlighted above suggest that lack of innovation isn't one of them.

In ablog post[1]published on Thursday, Michael Punke, VP of global public policy at Amazon Web Services, expressed support for a 'national legislative framework that protects individual civil rights and ensures that governments are transparent in their use of facial recognition technology.' Facial recognition is one of the fastest-growing areas of the artificial intelligence industry. It has drawn interest from both the public and private sector and is already worth billions of dollars. </p><p>Amazon has been moving fast to establish itself as a leader in facial recognition technology, actively marketing its Rekognition service to different customers, including law enforcement agencies. Amazon's latest announcement comes as a break from its previous approach toward setting legal constraints on its technology. The companyfaced backlash[2]from employees and civil rights activists over technical problems and privacy concerns regarding its facial recognition service and the implications of making it available to law enforcement and the military. But unlike other tech giants\u2014namelyGoogle[3]andMicrosoft[4]\u2014Amazon was not moved by the criticism and seemed determined to pursue its facial recognition ambitions at full speed. 'We are going to continue to support the DoD, and I think we should,' Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said at atech conference in San Francisco[5]in October. 'One of the jobs of senior leadership is to make the right decision, even when it's unpopular.' So Punke's announcement might look like a turnabout for the company. Amazon is not the first company to call for regulation of facial recognition. Microsoft President Brad Smith has been very vocal about the issue and has stressed on several occasions that regulatory oversight over the development and use of facial recognition. At first glance, vendors of facial recognition technologies are moving out of their way by calling for measures that would put constraints on their businesses. But in reality, as the industry matures, regulation will be in the greater interests of the developers of facial recognition technology, especially big tech companies.The benefits of facial recognition<url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/02/24/why-tech-giants-are-interested-in-regulating-facial-recognition/#Credits:\">https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/02/24/why-tech-giants-are-interested-in-regulating-facial-recognition/#Credits:</url>Reuters/Stephen LamSomething that might have been overlooked in the haze caused by the controversial news surrounding facial recognition services is the real positive use cases that the technology offers. Punke makes sure those positive uses don't go unnoticed. 'We've already seen the technology used to prevent human trafficking, reunite missing children with their parents, improve the physical security of a facility by automating access, and moderate offensive and illegal imagery posted online for removal,' Punke writes at the beginning of the post. In ablog post[6]published in December, Microsoft's Brad Smith listed several specific instances where the use of modern facial recognition has helped improve lives. One of the most notable cases was in India, where authorities were able totrace 3,000 missing children[7]by analyzing CCTV footage with facial recognition technology. Smith names other positive uses for facial recognition, including the detection of genetic diseases (although in that case, the technology used is facial analysis, a technique that is very close to facial recognition). Facial recognition is also useful in various settings to simplify actions that require the verification of a person's identity, such as making payments or unlocking smartphones.The privacy threats of using facial recognitionHowever, the benefits of facial recognition come withclear privacy tradeoffs[8]. To be clear, facial recognition can only be used in settings where there's already an available video feed, so some might argue that if you're being filmed, you've already given up your privacy and adding facial recognition capability to online cameras won't make a difference from a privacy standpoint. But facial recognition adds new profiling capabilities that can serve very sinister purposes. Take the example of the missing children of India. The government already had access to millions of hours' worth of surveillance video. But comparing the faces of all the people appearing in those videos against the photos of the thousands of missing children is something that is beyond the capability of human operators. In contrast, a well-trained facial recognition algorithm will be able to analyze all that video and flag faces of sought persons in a matter of hours. While in the case of India, facial recognition helped save the lives of missing children, in other settings it can become a tool for keeping tabs and controlling on specific groups of people, such as religious and ethnic minorities. 'When combined with ubiquitous cameras and massive computing power and storage in the cloud, a government could use facial recognition technology to enable continuous surveillance of specific individuals. It could follow anyone anywhere, or for that matter, everyone everywhere. It could do this at any time or even all the time. This use of facial recognition technology could unleash mass surveillance on an unprecedented scale,' Smith writes. Therefore, while recording video is a privacy problem, having tools that could search through all that video with the speed of state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms adds new concerns. For instance, consider Amazon's drive to put itsfacial recognition technology to smart home security cameras[9]. Should this happen, people who pass by a Rekognition-enhanced camera will not only have their faces recorded by the camera, but will also have their metadata uploaded into Amazon's cloud. This means the company will have a searchable directory of movements and locations linked to people's profiles, which it can then use for advertising purposes (or more evil goals). Part of the calls for regulation recommend transparency. Both government agencies and commercial organizations must clearly states when a camera is using facial recognition technology and to what extent it is using it, which includes the kind of data it collects, stores and analyzes. 'People deserve to know when this type of technology is being used, so they can ask questions and exercise some choice in the matter if they wish. Indeed, we believe this type of transparency is vital for building public knowledge and confidence in this technology,' Smith writes. Amazon's Punke also underlines the need for transparency and notice in both the public and commercial sector. Vendors of facial recognition must also make sure their customers don't use their technology to infringe on the rights of other people. 'Our customers are responsible for following the law in how they use the technology,' Punke writes in the AWS blog post. In case they don't take necessary measures to prevent their customers from making unethical use of their facial recognition technology, developers must be held to account by the law.There are no standards on fair and ethical use of facial recognition'In the two-plus years we've been offering Amazon Rekognition, we have not received a single report of misuse by law enforcement,' writes Punke. But the problem is, there's no clear definition on the ethical and fair use of facial recognition technology. 'What does misuse mean when there are no rules on use versus misuse?' Clare Garvie, a fellow at Georgetown University's Center on Privacy and Technology,toldWired[10]in an interview. For instance, in 2018, researchers from ACLU found that Rekognition was classifying at least28 members of Congress[11]as documented criminals. The researchers claimed that the facial recognition technology was less accurate when used on the images of non-white people, and it could lead to unfair decisions by law enforcement agencies. But Amazon dismissed the rebuke, arguing that the researchers had not correctly adjusted the accuracy threshold of its service. Current facial recognition technologies usemachine learning[12]. When used on an image, they provide a face ID and a confidence score which indicates how probable it is that the image belongs to that person. By default, Amazon's facial recognition technology considers any result with a confidence score of 80 percent or higher to be acceptable. In response to the ACLU research, an Amazon spokesperson said the company had advised law enforcement to use a 95-percent threshold. In the blog post, Punke recommends, 'law enforcement should use the recommended 99% confidence threshold.' But the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon, which is one of the customers of Amazon's facial recognition technology,told Gizmodo[13]that it isn't using confidence scores recommended by the company. What this entire debate proves is that without proper regulatory guidelines on how to use facial recognition technology, law enforcement might be undermining its own efforts to make cities safer. Relying on a technology that will churn up too many false positives will result in the arrest of innocent people and a degradation of trust in facial recognition.Should facial recognition be used to automate decisions?One of the most contentious debates over the use of facial recognition is whether it should be allowed to make decisions without human oversight. Should law enforcement automatically issue arrest warrants for people flagged by facial recognition systems? In his post, Punke clearly underlines the need for keeping a human in the loop. 'Facial recognition should not be used to make fully automated, final decisions that might result in a violation of a person's civil rights. In these situations, human review of facial recognition results should be used to ensure rights are not violated,' Punke writes. But without legal safeguards, government agencies might eventually hand over critical decision-making to AI algorithms. This was accentuated in the controversy surrounding Google's development ofcomputer vision algorithms[14]for the Department of Defense (DoD). In asigned petition[15]to Google executives, 90 academics in artificial intelligence, ethics, and computer science warned that 'these technologies are poised to become a basis for automated target recognition and autonomous weapon systems.' The need for human supervision is especially important because like other technologies based on deep learning and neural networks, current facial recognition applications are prone toalgorithmic bias[16]. Several studies have shown that facial recognition and analysis technologies from Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and other providers show different levels of accuracy toward various groups of people.Why tech giants stand to gain from regulation of facial recognition      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/02/24/why-tech-giants-are-interested-in-regulating-facial-recognition/#Amazon\">https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/02/24/why-tech-giants-are-interested-in-regulating-facial-recognition/#Amazon</url>[index company=amazon] headquartersThere's a general perception that regulation will hamper innovation. But in critical domains, regulation ensures responsible innovation while preventing damaging practices. For instance, in the automobile industry, regulations require all companies to abide by a set of safety standards. No manufacturer can lower the costs and price of its vehicles by removing or degrading vital parts such as brakes, airbags, chassis, etc. The law will prohibit such a car from being sold to consumers and driven on roads. In this case, regulation makes sure that companies can innovate responsibly while preventing bad actors from damaging the market by adopting unfair practices. The same thing goes for the facial recognition industry. Without regulation, companies might sacrifice ethics, privacy and moral standards for the sake of clinching deals. 'We don't believe that the world will be best served by a commercial race to the bottom, with tech companies forced to choose between social responsibility and market success,' Microsoft's Smith wrote. Regulation surrounding facial recognition will make sure that companies can continue to innovate within a framework that ensures the rights of all people are respected and prevents bad actors from undermining the industry and market with questionable practices. And therein lies the most important benefit to companies like Amazon and Microsoft. At the beginning of this post, we mentioned that at first glance, it seems that companies such as Microsoft and Amazon are going out of their way by calling for regulation of their technology. But the truth is, regulation or not, those companies will be forced to abide by a set of ethical principles simply because of the sheer size of capital and market share they are sitting on. They will always be under scrutiny by lawmakers, rights activists, analysts, the media and others who are looking at them through the skeptical lens of Big Brother tech companies. Googlegrudgingly relinquished[17]its involvement in DoD's Project Maven after it faced backlash from employees and AI experts. Microsoft also facedcriticism from its employees[18]because of a controversial contract with ICE. Should big tech companies exit the game, startups and smaller companies, which are spared many of the ethical and moral burdens of the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft, will find it easier to compete for the lucrative deals that the AI and facial recognition industry offers. Law enforcement might also find it less troublesome to engage in contracts with a company that is less in the focus of public attention. Regulation will level the ground (in favor of big tech companies), requiring developers and users of facial recognition to all abide by the same rules. Regulatory compliance costs money, and covering those costs will be easier for companies like Microsoft and Amazon than startups burning through seed and series A capital. In many ways, big tech's support for regulating facial recognition is like its support fornet neutrality[19]andGDPR rules[20]. At the end of the day, the move by big tech companies to regulate the facial recognition industry might be in total good faith. Or it might simply to make sure that the constraints that naturally bind them legally apply to all other companies that might compete for their share of the facial recognition market.

But investors hoping to snap up early-minted shares in order to profit from mega returns are likely to find many of these stocks are a losing bet. A new study conducted by Aneet Chachra, a portfolio manager of a hedge fund managed by Janus Henderson Group, shows that tech stocks purchased the first day they become available to the public dramatically underperform the market -- by an average of 10% -- during the first year, according to a detailed story inBarron's[2] as outlined below.Why Tech IPOs Are a Losing Bet  Median underperformance: 19% in first year  Average underperformance: 10% in first year Reason 1: tech IPOs tend to be initially overvalued  Reason 2: downward price pressure following 6-month lockup period Source: Barron's, per Janus Henderson's study of 220 IPOs What it Means for Investors Examining every U.S.-listed tech IPO over 12 months during the eight-year period between the January 2010 and March 2018, Chachra compiled data on 220 tech companies. </p><p>He found that if you can get in at the initial IPO's deal oroffering price[3], before it starts trading in thesecondary market[4], then 'you are going to do well.' Otherwise, being one of the early buyers at the stock's opening price in the secondary market is likely to end in underperformance for the first year.For investors who were able to purchase a tech stock at the initial offering price, average first-day gains were 21%, Chachra found. But for investors who bought in at the opening price on the first day of trading in the secondary market, the median underperformance in the first year is 19% and the average underperformance is 10%.Chachra attributes two reasons for the poor short-term performance of tech IPOs: behavioral bias and the lockup period. Behavioral bias points to the tendency for tech IPOs to be initially overvalued when they first start selling in the market, a feature that tends to be exacerbated by the preference most companies have for only going public when market conditions are strong. The lockup period refers to the regulatory six-month period that earlyventure capital[5] investors must wait out before selling their shares.Following that period, there is often downward price pressure as these investors sell their shares. Looking Ahead Giving these findings, investors may want to wait at least a year before pouncing on the next big tech IPO such as Uber's. By waiting, 'You may get another opportunity to buy at a much more attractive level,' Chachra says. Facebook is a case in point. It fared poorly soon after its 2012 IPO, but has risen nearly five-fold over the past 7 years. Studies looking at the longterm performance of IPOs, though, suggest caution is warranted even in these cases. A recentUBS study shows that more than 60%[6] of at least 7,000 IPOs from 1975 to 2011 had negative absolute returns after five years in the secondary market, per a story in CNBC. While an IPO is usually an indication that a company is growing quickly and wants to expand even more, that still may not guarantee that it's a winner as an investment.

MacGuineas contends that the tech companies are manipulating us into using their products, addicting our children to potentially harmful devices, and stealing our extremely valuable data in exchange for 'free' services.The Masses Are Not So Easily ManipulatedMacGuineas warns us of 'habit-forming' products and the 'Orwellian art of manipulating the masses':Many technology companies engineer their products to be habit-forming. A generation of Silicon Valley executives trained at the Stanford Behavior Design Lab in the Orwellian art of manipulating the masses. </p><p>The lab's founder, the experimental psychologist B. J. Fogg, has isolated the elements necessary to keep users of an app, a game, or a social network coming back for more. One former student, Nir Eyal, distilled the discipline in Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, an influential manual for developers. In it, he describes the benefits of enticements such as 'variable rewards'\u2014think of the rush of anticipation you experience as you wait for your Twitter feed to refresh, hoping to discover new likes and replies. Introducing such rewards to an app or a game, Eyal writes approvingly, 'suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason while activating the parts associated with wanting and desire.'Except the masses aren't so easy to manipulate. One experiment[3] on online shopping behavior found that the whales in the market are not influenced much at all by advertising: \"More frequent users whose purchasing behavior is not influenced by ads account for most of the advertising expenses, resulting in average returns that are negative.\" Arguably the most famous[4] line in the history of the advertising industry comes from nineteenth-century retailer John Wanamaker: \"Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted, the trouble is I don't know which half.\" Even with the advent of microtargeting based on behavioral and contextual data, there is still a debate[5] within the industry about whether advertising is worth the cost. A 2014 piece[6] in The Atlantic by Derek Thompson is simply titled, 'A Dangerous Question: Does Internet Advertising Work at All?' Thompson comes to a bleak conclusion: 'The more we learn which half of advertising is working, the more we realize we're wasting way more than half.' There's also reason to believe that advertising and other persuasive techniques are less effective in the internet age than they used to be. We have moved from an environment of information scarcity \u2014 in which companies had some amount of control over their brand image \u2014 to one of information abundance. As Thompson put it[7],Think about how much you can learn about products today before seeing an ad. Comments, user reviews, friends' opinions, price-comparison tools: These things aren't advertising (although they're just as ubiquitous). In fact, they're much more powerful than advertising because we consider them information rather than marketing. The difference is enormous: We seek information, so we're more likely to trust it; marketing seeks us, so we're more likely to distrust it.Even if targeted advertising is very ineffective at influencing consumer decisions, maybe cutting-edge machine learning algorithms \u2014 the ones used to recommend content in social media feeds \u2014 can still make a big impact on user behavior. Consider this recent story[8] from the NYT (emphasis added):Google Brain's researchers wondered if they could keep YouTube users engaged for longer by steering them into different parts of YouTube, rather than feeding their existing interests. And they began testing a new algorithm that incorporated a different type of A.I., called reinforcement learning. The new A.I., known as Reinforce, was a kind of long-term addiction machine. It was designed to maximize users' engagement over time by predicting which recommendations would expand their tastes and get them to watch not just one more video but many more. Reinforce was a huge success. In a talk at an A.I. conference in February, Minmin Chen, a Google Brain researcher, said it was YouTube's most successful launch in two years. Sitewide views increased by nearly 1 percent, she said \u2014 a gain that, at YouTube's scale, could amount to millions more hours of daily watch time and millions more dollars in advertising revenue per year.YouTube's 'most successful launch in two years' netted the platform a less than 1 percent increase in views. Across a billion users this is a significant achievement. But from the perspective of the individual YouTube user, this change is barely noticeable. Some people seem to believe that humans are sheep and tech companies are shepherds that can guide them wherever the profit motive leads. But the data contradicts this thesis at every step. MacGuineas also leaves out some crucial context about Eyal's book Hooked. As he told Ezra Klein in an interview[9] for Vox, Eyal wrote the book not only to explain how Big Tech was trying to influence us but also to democratize these tools for small- and medium-sized businesses. The hope was that once small competitors had the same tools and strategies as the tech giants, there would be a more level playing field in the market. The techniques described in Hooked are now common knowledge across many industries and therefore it is unlikely that consumer decisions between product A and product B are distorted on the margin. It's also worth noting that Eyal recently wrote another book[10] called Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life. The goal of the book is to provide readers with tips, strategies, and advice for aligning their short-term behavior with their long-term goals. People should be accountable for the decisions they make about how to spend their time and money and books like Indistractable are useful in helping individuals make the best choices for their self-interest in the long run. MacGuineas also chooses to cite an odd example of the harms caused by the tech industry:And [the tech companies] do, in fact, manipulate our behavior. As Harvard Business School's Shoshana Zuboff has noted, the ultimate goal of what she calls 'surveillance capitalism' is to turn people into marionettes. In a recent New York Times essay, Zuboff pointed to the wild success of Pokmon Go. Ostensibly a harmless game in which players use smartphones to stalk their neighborhoods for the eponymous cartoon creatures, the app relies on a system of rewards and punishments to herd players to McDonald's, Starbucks, and other stores that pay its developers for foot traffic. In the addiction economy, sellers can induce us to show up at their doorstep, whether they sell their wares from a website or a brick-and-mortar store. And if we're not quite in the mood to make a purchase? Well, they can manipulate that, too. As Zuboff noted in her essay, Facebook has boasted of its ability to subliminally alter our moods.Pokmon Go is ostensibly and actually harmless. When an augmented reality video game nudges you to walk by a Starbucks, you do not suffer any tangible consumer injury. You still retain your autonomy and the research shows that tiny nudges like this have almost no effect on your ultimate choices. It would be unsurprising if in the near future compane their spending from Pokmon Go because it proved to be ineffective, like so much of the rest of the advertising industry.Teens Are Addicted to Their Screens \u2014 and Not Much ElseAccording to[11] Common Sense Media, 'US teens spend an average of more than seven hours per day on screen media for entertainment, and tweens spend nearly five hours.' MacGuineas finds this usage alarming, calling tech products 'addictive' and 'potentially harmful':American society has long treated habit-forming products differently from non-habit-forming ones. The government restricts the age at which people can buy cigarettes and alcohol, and dictates places where they can be consumed. Until recently, gambling was illegal in most places, and closely regulated. But Big Tech has largely been left alone to insinuate addictive, potentially harmful products into the daily lives of millions of Americans, including children, by giving them away for free and even posturing as if they are a social good. The most addictive new devices and apps may need to be put behind the counter, as it were\u2014packaged with a stern warning about the dangers inherent in their use, and sold only to customers of age.This much screen time sounds excessive, and maybe it is. But while the use of technology by teenagers (e.g., smartphones, social media, video games) has been trending up over the last 20 years, risky behavior (e.g., drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, sex) has been trending down for almost every category:<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/QGtn7zSSource\">https://imgur.com/QGtn7zSSource</url>: Washington Post[12] Which of these is 'capitalism's addiction problem'? Given how many risky behaviors are on the decline, tech products may be capitalism's addiction solution rather than its problem. Now, as Jonathan Haidt has shown, there is some valid concern about the effect social media has on certain subgroups, in particular pre-teen girls. The rate of non-fatal self harm in this group nearly tripled[13] between 2000 and 2015. But does this mean we need government regulators to ban these products for everyone? Not quite. Haidt recommends[14] simple advice for parents to protect their kids: 'I am on a campaign to encourage parents to adopt 3 norms: 1) all screens out of bedroom 30 min before bedtime; 2) no social media until high school; 3) time limits on total daily device use (such as 2 hrs or less).' Given the evidence, these kind of limits seem reasonable for mitigating the harms caused of letting children use technology at too young an age.Pay for Facebook? Who, me?Lastly, MacGuineas also thinks regulators should require people to pay for Facebook:Perhaps the most immediate and important change we can make is to introduce transparency\u2014and thus, trust\u2014to exchanges in the technological realm. At present, many of the products and services with the greatest power to manipulate us are 'free,' in the sense that we don't pay to use them. But we are paying, in the form of giving up private data that we have not learned to properly value and that will be used in ways we don't fully understand. We should start paying for platforms like Facebook with our dollars, not our data.The logic here is: 1. Your data is more valuable than you realize. 2. Therefore, you should be forced to pay Big Tech companies to access services that are currently free. It also betrays a certain level of privilege to ignore the fact that many people, especially those in the developing world, cannot afford to pay for these digital services. And while it may feel different in our own solipsistic worlds, the sad truth is that our personal data is not worth nearly as much as MacGuineas and others claim. The prices from the data broker market are startling low[15]:  'General information about a person, such as their age, gender and location is worth a mere $0.0005 per person, or $0.50 per 1,000 people.'  'Knowing that a woman is expecting a baby and is in her second trimester of pregnancy, for instance, sends the price tag for that information about her to $0.11.'  'For $0.26 per person, buyers can access lists of people with specific health conditions or taking certain prescriptions.'  '[T]he sum total for most individuals often is less than a dollar.' Given the reality of the market valuation of our personal data, we should just take the free services. The tropes in this article are nothing new for those who have been following this debate over the last few years. The false narrative that tech is especially addictive and harmful has been on the rise for quite some time now. Unfortunately that doesn't make it any more true.
