The other aspect of this that was not mentioned is the range of on line hubs where we can expect more assistance. </p><p>There are a range of areas we need to think about this. The tech economy has changed dramatically and the tech companies power has changed dramatically. Whatever actions of this government and this country takes me to be thought through. They will be substantially attacked and secondly, I hope they will be an example to the world on how to do this and it will only be so if we thought through them properly, it designed carefully so they can be robust under scrutiny. Jeremy Wright. Ministers have been told to come up with creative alternatives to London's night crime epidemic including banning offences from social media. -- offenders. Police have been logged nearly 1300 knife attacks. The MP Sarah Jones said harsher sentences were not working. 40% in 2010 to almost 70% today and get into the last five years knife crime has been on shocking increase suggesting that harsher sentences simply are not the answer. Can we look at two things that creative alternatives to prison, such as banning young people from social media is easing to incite violence and secondly education and rehabilitation to keep young people out of the prison system. I know the honourable lady has a key interest in the issue. I do not think there is a direct correlation. We have seen a rise in knife crimes and it is right that we have approached the issue of possession more seriously but I take on board the point about causation. I deeply impressed with work being done with young people and it is intervention in an early stage which can help. I know the government have been looking at hospital admissions falling in 12 years. Can you let us not what policies can be included? Glasgow is an excellent example. Only last month I spoke to Scottish law officers about their experiences and I am deeply interested. MPs spent the afternoon on debate entitled global Britain. It was all about the UK placed itself in the new world where the old structures no longer existed. We need to be clear. We need an assessment of our place in the world and be clear about what we are going to do to maximise our position into the future and that means understanding who we are and what we want. Because we have a real choice here. Either we choose to shape events or we will be shaped by then. I can tell you very clearly that that many people today do not believe in the Devil, they did not believe in the evil of war coming back to Europe, in the dangers of undermining the international system, they believe that rules in some ways are optional, the truth is that they are simply not. I can tell you this because I have seen myself and the cost of it having been to Baghdad and it'll class homes that were wealthy areas into which people lived in very civilised societies in the 60s and 50s. Having been to Kabul and seen family photos of people showing their daughter is going to universities in miniskirts and our living with the reality of fundamentalism, barbarity and war.

Finally, what do you see as the biggest risk in terms of food in the coming year? If you say what keeps you up at night, not much. Because you are always in the air!</p><p> Three things, really. Food safety is a big issue. Secondly, as I said, we?re always one good crop away from a problem. The third thing, which is a bit more endemic, is the issue of how do governments respond if there is a crisis in the food supply? We saw in 2008 again supply-side shock, prices ramped up and governments around the world forced some form of restriction, which exacerbated the problem. But in 2010 and 2012, when there was a big drought in the US, the G8 and G20 came out saying no restrictions and free trade was part of the solution. That was Paul Conway. So, what is the outlook for business as commodity prices have come down but could remain volatile? Will there be more global deals as companies from the US and emerging markets look to invest overseas? Still with me to discuss this are my guests, the global chief investment officer and executive of DFG Asset Management, the Singapore managing partner of Clifford Chance, and the country manager for PayPal in south-east Asia. Let me start with that. There have been a lot of changes in global business, but what is the biggest global business trend we should be watching out for? There are two that are the most important. The energy price move that we have seen seems to be forcing a lot of consolidation. We have seen recent deals that have come to the fore as some of these companies start to protect their future in a period where oil prices A lot of mergers and deals on the back of that? What is the other one you have an eye on? Obviously, social media, technology generally, continues to attract a lot of attention. There's been a huge amount of money that's been put into social media over the last 10-15 years in particular. That is now making its way into those companies and those companies are starting to rise out. What are some big tech company investments we should be keeping an eye out for? Are there trends? Disruptive technologies? Give us a glimpse of what you are watching. I think a couple of things are happening. The social processes are getting bigger, getting into the social fabric. I think that will continue to grow. The other interesting thing that we have seen a level playing field is being created across the world. There is an opportunity for a small farmer in Indonesia to get online and start selling, for example, whatever they are producing globally. That did not exist before and technology has really enabled that. We are seeing the rise of the services businesses. Not just people just selling products and services, but online travel and digital gaming. In terms of looking at business, it sounds like there are good opportunities in different areas but how is business different because of it? There are three key things we are noticing. The first one is around reputational risk. When you look to invest in a country, you really need to understand system, the fabric and the people you're dealing with. The second is political risk, which manifests itself in lots of different ways. That requires a different type of approach and analysis. The third area which is really important is legal risk. We are seeing some changes there. In Singapore, we will see the first international commercial court established in Asia in 2015. That, together with the new economic cooperation within south-east Asia, will be a major milestone in the development of this region. What are some of the ways that you are doing business that have changed because of all of the trends we have been discussing? I think one big fundamental change that's happened is the rise of mobile. It has happened so fast. Businesses in the tech world have had to have this mobile first kind of mentality. Apart from that, I feel the regulatory risk has always been there but it has kind of stabilised now. I feel regulators are more open to understanding new business models and embracing them.

I'm Simon McCoy. The headlines at three: It's \"the right to be forgotten\" , tougher government controls are proposed, making it easier for people to force social media companies to delete their information. </p><p>North Korea vows to retaliate and make \"the US pay a price\" for UN sanctions over its banned nuclear weapons programme. 46-year-old Eloise Dixon from Kent is recovering in hospital after being shot while on a family holiday to Brazil. A British model who says she was kidnapped for six days in Italy returns to the UK, saying she feared for her life \"second by second.\" I've been through a terrifying experience, I feared for my life second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour - I am incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release. Also in the next hour: New Dr Who Jodie Whittaker gives her first interview since being cast in the role. Jodie Whittaker says being a female Time Lord, is a proud honour... And she cannot wait to begin. I hope my gender isn't a fearful thing for the fans, because in this world particularly, there aren't rules and that's a great thing. Good afternoon and welcome to BBC News. New laws are to be introduced, giving people greater control over what happens to their online personal data. The government says the legislation offers \"the right to be forgotten,\" with proposals in the Data Protection Bill making it easier to withdraw consent for information to be used. Companies will also have to obtain \"explicit\" consent, rather than using pre-selected tick boxes, to gather details online. Here's our political correspondent, Leila Nathoo. Our lives are led online. We all leave a digital trail. But what happens to all the information we upload about ourselves? A new law will ensure that the United Kingdom will retain its world-class regime of protecting personal data. Now we will have more control, data protection laws are being strengthened. The government has confirmed a bill will be published in the autumn, bringing EU regulations due to come in next year onto the statute book. Internet users will be given more powers to protect their data. It will be easier for people to find out what information organisations hold about them and allow them to ask for data to be deleted. Firms will no longer be able to rely on pre-selected tick boxes. Instead, explicit consent will be required to collect personal details. And the information watchdog will be given more powers to issue fines of up to #17 million for serious data breaches. I think there are a lot of pitfalls ahead if actually the benefit of this, which is people feeling far more comfortable transacting online and their data is going to be protected, will work. I think it's a good first step to have the regulation in place. It's how it gets implemented that's the key thing. The new rules won't only apply to the big tech companies and social media giants. They will affect every organisation that processes information online. And the definition of personal data is being expanded, too, to include things like IP addresses to help safeguard identities. There is your photo going up online, your tweet, your search, the search results. But then there is a whole back office, which is the industry of data capture, data processing. That data is processed and it is then that the insights are shared with advertisers, principally. Our digital footprints are growing ever larger. Ministers say data protection laws must keep pace. Leila Nathoo, BBC News. Some breaking news from South Africa, we are hearing that the speaker of parliament has announced a vote of no-confidence to behold on President Jacob Zuma's government can be held in a secret ballot. This increases on Jacob Zuma, this could encourage ENC lawmakers to pursue action to oust him, the vote has become a test of the unity of the party. Senior party figures have become increasingly critical of their leader. Suggestions that it was unlikely to succeed in toppling Jacob Zuma increases pressure on him considerably. He came to power in 2009 and has been implicated in multiple corruption scandals. The country's economy has fallen into recession and unemployment is at record Lee high levels.

France is bracing itself for a heatwave with temperatures expected to push thermometers over 40 degrees Celsius later in the week. Germany, Switzerland and Belgium could also see national records for June broken in the coming days. But comparisons are being made to France's 2003 heatwave in which almost 15,000 people died. </p><p>Ramzan Karmali reports. From France to Germany, Hungary and Spain. It may look as if people across Europe are enjoying the sunshine but for many, soaring temperatures are taking their toll and they are set to get hired to do the heat experience across much of Europe is down to a weather system over the Atlantic. It is created atmospheric treasure over the region, drawn up hot air from northern Africa and Spain. This means high temperatures. Previous record temperatures of 38.5 degrees in Germany and 41.5 in France looks set to be beaten this week. In Paris, a Level three extreme heat plan has been activated. Level four, the maximum, has never been used. As part of the plan, 900 cool places have been set up including putting up temporary fountains and Mr Machine stated parks are being kept open at night for people to cool down in. 800,000 schoolchildren have had their exams postponed because of concerns about people's health. Comparisons are being drawn to the heat wave France experienced in August 2003. Almost 15,000 people died then and the president is urged people to be aware of the dangers. TRANSLATION: The most vulnerable people must be taken care of quickly because during this kind of episode, people who are sick, pregnant, newborns and the elderly are the most vulnerable. We must remain vigilant and have preventative measures in place to intervene as quickly as possible. It looks as if many people have heeded his advice dig there has been a rush at this store that sells fans and air conditioning units. And people will need plenty of this stuff. Rising humidity will make weather feel even hotter. The head of global affairs at Facebook, Nick Clegg, says the company has set up an independent oversight board to rule on which material should be removed from the platform. The former UK deputy Prime Minister said there was a \"pressing need\" for greater regulation of the technology sector. He also insisted there was \"no evidence\" that Russia had influenced the result of the Brexit referendum using Facebook. Our media editor Amol Rajan has this report. What kind of Internet do you want? Do you want the one most of us experience today - a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or maybe you preferred the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants? Facebook and Sir Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated and more European. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight in that word, \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know about whose advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't actually think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. The former Lib Dem leader said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self harm on Instagram, one of the platforms it owns following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a tech-lash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be the free, raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us, but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-750d68e3f43c49fab906c33a020eb5f7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-3981-JBH6-C45W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

There is no accountability in the system. As for Jussie Smollett's acting career after all this, the makers of his TV show, 20th Century Fox, say they were gratified to see the charges against him dismissed. Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Chicago. </p><p>The European Parliament has passed a controversial new law designed to protect copyright on the internet. Its supporters say the legislation will guarantee fair payment for artists, musicians and writers whose work is shared on networks such as Google or Facebook. But opponents argue the law will stifle internet freedom. Our media editor Amol Rajan has been investigating. Recognise that tune? Well, no wonder, this is probably the most watched video in human history with a mere 6 billion views on YouTube. Great marketing, but who picked up the bill? Not YouTube, that digital Narnia containing millions of videos, most of them free to view. As host platforms, companies like YouTube don't generally pay artists or publishers for their work. Today's ruling could change all that and return cash to the creators or owners of the content. It's based on two clauses within the EU Copyright Directive. Article 11 says search engines and news aggregators will have to pay to use links from news websites. Article 13 says large tech companies will be responsible for content they use without copyright. They will have to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. This potentially changes their very nature of the web. Many artists and publishers have campaigned strongly for the changes demanding payment for ideas and content which they created. But campaigners for the open Web and tech giants themselves who spend huge sums lobbying against the changes say this is a dark day for civil society across the globe. They add that these rules could be unworkable. There are important caveats here. The reforms have already been deleted and they remain short on vital detail. If approved by EU member states, each country will have two years to make the changes and of course Britain's future relationship with the EU is still unclear. This is really about competing visions of the World Wide Web. The internet model we have in the West today is dominated by a few mostly Californian giants. The coming iteration of the internet will probably be more regulated and less literally of a free-for-all while stopping short of the walled garden users occupy in places like China. Whether it is on competition rules, new data protection is or now copyright, it is Europe that is clipping the wings of big tech. The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The pyramids and the pharoahs of ancient Egypt have long been a source of fascination and wonder. But how about the royal women. A new exhibit in Washington is turning the spotlight onto the Queens of Egypt - and how they ruled. The BBC's Jane O'Brien has this story. One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols of authoritarian rule. It is a very strange thing in a patriarchal society to allow a woman to step to the highest rung of the ladder and to lead her people so we know very, very little. We know the perfected image. There were many queens of Egypt - this exhibition looks at six, spanning more than 1,400 years of ancient history. It's hard to know exactly how</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-0e8ad735fe1144ab841331b07aefa5ab</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-PPS1-JBH6-C03V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I would not be my mother's son if I was capable of one drop of what I've been accused of. Chicago's Police Chief, stunned, had this reaction. Do I think justice was served?</p><p> No. What do I think justice is? I think this city is still owed an apology. While Chicago's Mayor fumed that his celebrity clearly played a part in the decision to drop charges against him. This is, without a doubt, a whitewash of justice and sends a clear message that if you're in a position of influence and power, you will get treated one way, other people will be treated another way. There is no accountability in the system. As for Jussie Smollett's acting career after all this, the makers of his TV show, 20th Century Fox, say they were gratified to see the charges against him dismissed. Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Chicago. The European Parliament has passed a controversial new law designed to protect copyright on the internet. Its supporters say the legislation will guarantee fair payment for artists, musicians and writers whose work is shared on networks such as Google or Facebook. But opponents argue the law will stifle internet freedom. Our media editor Amol Rajan has been investigating. Recognise that tune? Well, no wonder, this is probably the most watched video in human history with a mere 6 billion views on YouTube. Great marketing, but who picked up the bill? Not YouTube, that digital Narnia containing millions of videos, most of them free to view. As host platforms, companies like YouTube don't generally pay artists or publishers for their work. Today's ruling could change all that and return cash to the creators or owners of the content. It's based on two clauses within the EU Copyright Directive. Article 11 says search engines and news aggregators will have to pay to use links from news websites. Article 13 says large tech companies will be responsible for content they use without copyright. They will have to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. This potentially changes their very nature of the web. Many artists and publishers have campaigned strongly for the changes demanding payment for ideas and content which they created. But campaigners for the open Web and tech giants themselves who spend huge sums lobbying against the changes say this is a dark day for civil society across the globe. They add that these rules could be unworkable. There are important caveats here. The reforms have already been deleted and they remain short on vital detail. If approved by EU member states, each country will have two years to make the changes and of course Britain's future relationship with the EU is still unclear. This is really about competing visions of the World Wide Web. The internet model we have in the West today is dominated by a few mostly Californian giants. The coming iteration of the internet will probably be more regulated and less literally of a free-for-all while stopping short of the walled garden users occupy in places like China. Whether it is on competition rules, new data protection is or now copyright, it is Europe that is clipping the wings of big tech. The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The pyramids and the pharoahs of ancient Egypt have long been a source of fascination and wonder. But how about the royal women. A new exhibit in Washington is turning the spotlight onto the Queens of Egypt - and how they ruled. The BBC's Jane O'Brien has this story. One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-d044ffcde4a54eab9ec8a3dacbf9b36f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-PPS1-JBH6-C003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

While Chicago's Mayor fumed that his celebrity clearly played a part in the decision to drop charges against him. This is, without a doubt, a whitewash of justice and sends a clear message that if you're in a position of influence and power, you will get treated one way, other people will be treated another way. There is no accountability in the system. </p><p>As for Jussie Smollett's acting career after all this, the makers of his TV show, 20th Century Fox, say they were gratified to see the charges against him dismissed. Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Chicago. The European Parliament has passed a controversial new law designed to protect copyright on the internet. Its supporters say the legislation will guarantee fair payment for artists, musicians and writers whose work is shared on networks such as Google or Facebook. But opponents argue the law will stifle internet freedom. Our media editor Amol Rajan has been investigating. Recognise that tune? Well, no wonder, this is probably the most watched video in human history with a mere 6 billion views on YouTube. Great marketing, but who picked up the bill? Not YouTube, that digital Narnia containing millions of videos, most of them free to view. As host platforms, companies like YouTube don't generally pay artists or publishers for their work. Today's ruling could change all that and return cash to the creators or owners of the content. It's based on two clauses within the EU Copyright Directive. Article 11 says search engines and news aggregators will have to pay to use links from news websites. Article 13 says large tech companies will be responsible for content they use without copyright. They will have to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. This potentially changes their very nature of the web. Many artists and publishers have campaigned strongly for the changes demanding payment for ideas and content which they created. But campaigners for the open Web and tech giants themselves who spend huge sums lobbying against the changes say this is a dark day for civil society across the globe. They add that these rules could be unworkable. There are important caveats here. The reforms have already been deleted and they remain short on vital detail. If approved by EU member states, each country will have two years to make the changes and of course Britain's future relationship with the EU is still unclear. This is really about competing visions of the World Wide Web. The internet model we have in the West today is dominated by a few mostly Californian giants. The coming iteration of the internet will probably be more regulated and less literally of a free-for-all while stopping short of the walled garden users occupy in places like China. Whether it is on competition rules, new data protection is or now copyright, it is Europe that is clipping the wings of big tech. The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The pyramids and the pharoahs of ancient Egypt have long been a source of fascination and wonder. But how about the royal women. A new exhibit in Washington is turning the spotlight onto the Queens of Egypt - and how they ruled. The BBC's Jane O'Brien has this story. One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols of authoritarian rule. It is a very strange thing in a patriarchal society to allow a woman to step to the highest rung of the ladder and to lead her people so we know very, very little. We know the perfected image.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-0ed71926ec74459abb5dc976cdb7124a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-PPS1-JBH6-C031-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The former star of the TV show Empire has been indicted by a grand jury in Chicago. Venezualans are bracing themselves for another day of rival demonstrations by supporters of President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition leader trying to force him from power, Juan Guaido. The protests come after much of the country has been without power for more than 24 hours. </p><p>From Caracas, Will Grant, reports. Even for people accustomed to blackouts, this was the worst anyone could remember. Almost all 23 states in Venezuela, plus the capital city, plunged into darkness for more than a day. The chaos it caused was huge. For an already creaking public transport system, some faced little choice but to walk, even with their children under their arms. \"I've been walking from Plaza Venezuela, which is almost 3km away,\" said this young mother. \"I still have a bit more to go.\" The power cut came amid high political tension in the country with the opposition leader Juan Guaido trying to force President Nicolas Maduro from office. Both men tried to blame the other. The Maduro government said the blackout was an act of sabotage by the opposition, while Mr Guaido's camp blamed government incompetence, corruption and under-investment. TRANSLATION: I am worried for the people who face difficulties in getting home, for the food that's beginning to rot, for the patients who are hospitalised, about whom we are very concerned because of the lack of electrical power. Beyond the accusations of either sabotage or incompetence, most Venezuelans are just caught in the middle, unable to go to work or lead relatively normal lives. The blackout just adds to the growing sense of anxiety across Venezuela. TRANSLATION: I came out looking for water and food for my family, but because of the electrical blackout, the traffic lights aren't working and someone crashed into our car. Now we are stuck here, as you can see. Now attention turns to Saturday's planned marches. Two opposing demonstrations planned - one pro-Maduro, the other calling for him to go. The long blackout has left people exhausted, but many will still take to the streets to show where their loyalties lie. It seems power - and the lack of it - will be the key questions facing Venezuelans for some time yet. Will Grant, BBC News, Caracas. Let's take at look at some of today's other stories on BBC News. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten of the nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. America's commercial astronaut capsule, the SpaceX Dragon, has successfully completed its six-day test mission into space. The craft, which had a robot on board, re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and touched down in the Atlantic Ocean. The US space agency Nasa says that for the first time in eight years it could now consider sending astronauts back into orbit. More than 200 items from George Michael's personal art collection are to be auctioned this week in London. The singer - who died in December 2016 - built up his collection by visiting galleries and artists' studios. Any money made will go to charity. Internet users should have greater control over personal data to ensure their own safety online. It's part of a proposal to change the way big tech companies are regulated. It follows a report from The House of Lords Communications Committee which says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had viewed graphic images about self harm online. Molly's father has said he believes social media was partly to blame for her death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online, and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nation state, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in the Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies, but if we think they need to do things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications Committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the Committee is calling for big tech to be reined in.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The pyramids and the pharoahs of ancient Egypt have long been a source of fascination and wonder. But how about the royal women. A new exhibit in Washington is turning the spotlight onto the Queens of Egypt - and how they ruled. The BBC's Jane O'Brien has this story. One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols of authoritarian rule. It is a very strange thing in a patriarchal society to allow a woman to step to the highest rung of the ladder and to lead her people so we know very, very little. We know the perfected image. There were many queens of Egypt - this exhibition looks at six, spanning more than 1,400 years of ancient history. It's hard to know exactly how they lived but there is plenty here to show how they died and how their memories were perfected. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have met the Cuban President on the first full day of their trip to the Caribbean island. It's the first time members of the Royal Family have made an official visit to the Communist state. The Prince Dnd duchess were treated to a dance performance, before meeting the President at the Palace of the Revolution. Hello there. Don't expect any major changes in our weather over the next few days. There is more dry weather to come, some spells of sunshine and patchy cloud as well. One subtle difference, it is going to turn a little bit milder for a time at least. High pressure then sitting to the south of the British Isles. The winds allowing cloud to feed in over the top of that area of high pressure so we will continue to bring areas of cloud from the north-west towards the south of the UK through the first part of Wednesday. Best of the clear spells as we start off the day across southern and western parts of England</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-54163e048bcd4bd7be77b2f9bd0cace3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-PPR1-JBH6-C53C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols of authoritarian rule. It is a very strange thing in a patriarchal society to allow a woman to step to the highest rung of the ladder and to lead her people so we know very, very little. We know the perfected image. There were many queens of Egypt - this exhibition looks at six, spanning more than 1,400 years of ancient history. It's hard to know exactly how they lived but there is plenty here to show how they died and how their memories were perfected. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have met the Cuban President on the first full day of their trip to the Caribbean island. It's the first time members of the Royal Family have made an official visit to the Communist state. The Prince Dnd duchess were treated to a dance performance, before meeting the President at the Palace of the Revolution. Hello there. Don't expect any major changes in our weather over the next few days. There is more dry weather to come, some spells of sunshine and patchy cloud as well. One subtle difference, it is going to turn a little bit milder for a time at least. High pressure then sitting to the south of the British Isles. The winds allowing cloud to feed in over the top of that area of high pressure so we will continue to bring areas of cloud from the north-west towards the south of the UK through the first part of Wednesday. Best of the clear spells as we start off the day across southern and western parts of England</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-5305c5aa88ed4852ad2ab00598e85d88</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-PPR1-JBH6-C52N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Not YouTube, that digital Narnia containing millions of videos, most of them free to view. As host platforms, companies like YouTube don't generally pay artists or publishers for their work. </p><p>Today's ruling could change all that and return cash to the creators or owners of the content. It's based on two clauses within the EU Copyright Directive. Article 11 says search engines and news aggregators will have to pay to use links from news websites. Article 13 says large tech companies will be responsible for content they use without copyright. They will have to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. This potentially changes their very nature of the web. Many artists and publishers have campaigned strongly for the changes demanding payment for ideas and content which they created. But campaigners for the open Web and tech giants themselves who spend huge sums lobbying against the changes say this is a dark day for civil society across the globe. They add that these rules could be unworkable. There are important caveats here. The reforms have already been deleted and they remain short on vital detail. If approved by EU member states, each country will have two years to make the changes and of course Britain's future relationship with the EU is still unclear. This is really about competing visions of the World Wide Web. The internet model we have in the West today is dominated by a few mostly Californian giants. The coming iteration of the internet will probably be more regulated and less literally of a free-for-all while stopping short of the walled garden users occupy in places like China.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The pyramids and the pharoahs of ancient Egypt have long been a source of fascination and wonder. But how about the royal women. A new exhibit in Washington is turning the spotlight onto the Queens of Egypt - and how they ruled. The BBC's Jane O'Brien has this story. One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols of authoritarian rule. It is a very strange thing in a patriarchal society to allow a woman to step to the highest rung of the ladder and to lead her people so we know very, very little. We know the perfected image. There were many queens of Egypt - this exhibition looks at six, spanning more than 1,400 years of ancient history. It's hard to know exactly how they lived but there is plenty here to show how they died and how their memories were perfected.

The pyramids and the pharoahs of ancient Egypt have long been a source of fascination and wonder. But how about the royal women. A new exhibit in Washington is turning the spotlight onto the Queens of Egypt - and how they ruled. The BBC's Jane O'Brien has this story. One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols of authoritarian rule. It is a very strange thing in a patriarchal society to allow a woman to step to the highest rung of the ladder and to lead her people so we know very, very little. We know the perfected image. There were many queens of Egypt - this exhibition looks at six, spanning more than 1,400 years of ancient history. It's hard to know exactly how they lived but there is plenty here to show how they died and how their memories were perfected. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have met the Cuban President on the first full day of their trip to the Caribbean island. It's the first time members of the Royal Family have made an official visit to the Communist state. The Prince Dnd duchess were treated to a dance performance, before meeting the President at the Palace of the Revolution. Hello there.

But opponents argue the law will stifle internet freedom. Our media editor Amol Rajan has been investigating. Recognise that tune? Well, no wonder, this is probably the most watched video in human history with a mere 6 billion views on YouTube. </p><p>Great marketing, but who picked up the bill? Not YouTube, that digital Narnia containing millions of videos, most of them free to view. As host platforms, companies like YouTube don't generally pay artists or publishers for their work. Today's ruling could change all that and return cash to the creators or owners of the content. It's based on two clauses within the EU Copyright Directive. Article 11 says search engines and news aggregators will have to pay to use links from news websites. Article 13 says large tech companies will be responsible for content they use without copyright. They will have to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. This potentially changes their very nature of the web. Many artists and publishers have campaigned strongly for the changes demanding payment for ideas and content which they created. But campaigners for the open Web and tech giants themselves who spend huge sums lobbying against the changes say this is a dark day for civil society across the globe. They add that these rules could be unworkable. There are important caveats here. The reforms have already been deleted and they remain short on vital detail. If approved by EU member states, each country will have two years to make the changes and of course Britain's future relationship with the EU is still unclear. This is really about competing visions of the World Wide Web. The internet model we have in the West today is dominated by a few mostly Californian giants. The coming iteration of the internet will probably be more regulated and less literally of a free-for-all while stopping short of the walled garden users occupy in places like China. Whether it is on competition rules, new data protection is or now copyright, it is Europe that is clipping the wings of big tech. The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The pyramids and the pharoahs of ancient Egypt have long been a source of fascination and wonder. But how about the royal women. A new exhibit in Washington is turning the spotlight onto the Queens of Egypt - and how they ruled. The BBC's Jane O'Brien has this story. One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols of authoritarian rule. It is a very strange thing in a patriarchal society to allow a woman to step to the highest rung of the ladder and to lead her people so we know very, very little. We know the perfected image. There were many queens of Egypt - this exhibition looks at six, spanning more than 1,400 years of ancient history. It's hard to know exactly how they lived but there is plenty here to show how they died and how their memories were perfected. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have met the Cuban President on the first full day of their trip to the Caribbean island. It's the first time members of the Royal Family have made an official visit to the Communist state. The Prince Dnd duchess were treated to a dance performance, before meeting the President at the Palace of the Revolution. Hello there.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The pyramids and the pharoahs of ancient Egypt have long been a source of fascination and wonder. But how about the royal women. A new exhibit in Washington is turning the spotlight onto the Queens of Egypt - and how they ruled. The BBC's Jane O'Brien has this story. One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols of authoritarian rule. It is a very strange thing in a patriarchal society to allow a woman to step to the highest rung of the ladder and to lead her people so we know very, very little. We know the perfected image. There were many queens of Egypt - this exhibition looks at six, spanning more than 1,400 years of ancient history. It's hard to know exactly how they lived but there is plenty here to show how they died and how their memories were perfected. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have met the Cuban President on the first full day of their trip to the Caribbean island. It's the first time members of the Royal Family have made an official visit to the Communist state. The Prince Dnd duchess were treated to a dance performance, before meeting the President at the Palace of the Revolution. Hello there.

One subtle difference, it is going to turn a little bit milder for a time at least. High pressure then sitting to the south of the British Isles. The winds allowing cloud to feed in over the top of that area of high pressure so we will continue to bring areas of cloud from the north-west towards the south of the UK through the first part of Wednesday.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. The pyramids and the pharoahs of ancient Egypt have long been a source of fascination and wonder. But how about the royal women. A new exhibit in Washington is turning the spotlight onto the Queens of Egypt - and how they ruled. The BBC's Jane O'Brien has this story. One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols of authoritarian rule. It is a very strange thing in a patriarchal society to allow a woman to step to the highest rung of the ladder and to lead her people so we know very, very little. We know the perfected image. There were many queens of Egypt - this exhibition looks at six, spanning more than 1,400 years of ancient history. It's hard to know exactly how they lived but there is plenty here to show how they died and how their memories were perfected. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have met the Cuban President on the first full day of their trip to the Caribbean island. It's the first time members of the Royal Family have made an official visit to the Communist state. The Prince Dnd duchess were treated to a dance performance, before meeting the President at the Palace of the Revolution. Hello there.

Not YouTube, that digital Narnia containing millions of videos, most of them free to view. As host platforms, companies like YouTube don't generally pay artists or publishers for their work. </p><p>Today's ruling could change all that and return cash to the creators or owners of the content. It's based on two clauses within the EU Copyright Directive. Article 11 says search engines and news aggregators will have to pay to use links from news websites. Article 13 says large tech companies will be responsible for content they use without copyright. They will have to apply filters to content before it is uploaded.

The pyramids and the pharoahs of ancient Egypt have long been a source of fascination and wonder. But how about the royal women. A new exhibit in Washington is turning the spotlight onto the Queens of Egypt - and how they ruled. The BBC's Jane O'Brien has this story. One of the most lavish tombs ever discovered in ancient Egypt. This 3D recreation shows just how beloved Queen Nefertari must have been. More than 3,000 years and many looters later, it's probably as good as we will get to seeing what it was like. This sarcophagus is so important because it is the only thing that remains of the funerary set of Queen Nefertari. Made from pink granite, Nefertari's sarcophagus was discovered in 1904 along with what may be the Queen's knees. These knees are kind of a mystery that we are trying to solve. First we can say they belonged to a woman who died around the age of 40, who lived in the New Kingdom. So this seems to fit perfectly wth Queen Nefertari, but we can't say exactly it's her. Tracing the story of Egypt's queens can be tough. Although many ruled in their own right, they still lived in a man's world and their history was often manipulated or even erased. The tales told in stunning hieroglyphics can't be trusted because they're also symbols of authoritarian rule. It is a very strange thing in a patriarchal society to allow a woman to step to the highest rung of the ladder and to lead her people so we know very, very little. We know the perfected image. There were many queens of Egypt - this exhibition looks at six, spanning more than 1,400 years of ancient history. It's hard to know exactly how they lived but there is plenty here to show how they died and how their memories were perfected. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have met the Cuban President on the first full day of their trip to the Caribbean island. It's the first time members of the Royal Family have made an official visit to the Communist state. The Prince Dnd duchess were treated to a dance performance, before meeting the President at the Palace of the Revolution. Hello there.

I hope my gender isn't a fearful thing for the fans, because in this world particularly, there aren't rules and that's a great thing. Good afternoon and welcome to BBC News. New laws are to be introduced, giving people greater control over what happens to their online personal data. The government says the legislation offers \"the right to be forgotten,\" with proposals in the Data Protection Bill making it easier to withdraw consent for information to be used. Companies will also have to obtain \"explicit\" consent, rather than using pre-selected tick boxes, to gather details online. Here's our political correspondent, Leila Nathoo. Our lives are led online. We all leave a digital trail. But what happens to all the information we upload about ourselves? A new law will ensure that the United Kingdom will retain its world-class regime of protecting personal data. Now we will have more control, data protection laws are being strengthened. The government has confirmed a bill will be published in the autumn, bringing EU regulations due to come in next year onto the statute book. Internet users will be given more powers to protect their data. It will be easier for people to find out what information organisations hold about them and allow them to ask for data to be deleted. Firms will no longer be able to rely on pre-selected tick boxes. Instead, explicit consent will be required to collect personal details. And the information watchdog will be given more powers to issue fines of up to #17 million for serious data breaches. I think there are a lot of pitfalls ahead if actually the benefit of this, which is people feeling far more comfortable transacting online and their data is going to be protected, will work. I think it's a good first step to have the regulation in place. It's how it gets implemented that's the key thing. The new rules won't only apply to the big tech companies and social media giants. They will affect every organisation that processes information online. And the definition of personal data is being expanded, too, to include things like IP addresses to help safeguard identities. There is your photo going up online, your tweet, your search, the search results. But then there is a whole back office, which is the industry of data capture, data processing. That data is processed and it is then that the insights are shared with advertisers, principally. Our digital footprints are growing ever larger. Ministers say data protection laws must keep pace. Leila Nathoo, BBC News. Tom factory, innovation Director at the Confederation of Earth British industry joins me now, is this the way forward? I think so, businesses are innovating with data all the time and the more that comes online, the more that will happen. It is important there is trust between businesses and consumers about how data is used and this regulation goes on the right direction in terms of fostering owl trust. When you say businesses are innovating with information, there are fears that businesses are doing more than that, analysing personal information and</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-cd87d6b957044b9fb9b737b976a6412f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P69-7P11-DY08-3025-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"775\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TVEyes, Inc.

It wouldn't surprise me at all if the EU regulators, the European medicines agency, was in touch with the Food and Drug Administration to see what processes they went through, and are probably thinking of similar processes themselves. So how widely might it be used in the UK? Well, we have to go through the regulatory processes. </p><p>The European medicines agency for Europe, as I said. But if they give the green light and then the government gives the green light for it to be used, I can imagine it could be used very widely across the UK. Certainly the doctors I've spoken to have been very keen to use it for their patients. How much of a difference might it make in helping the UK get through the worst of this outbreak? Well, I should preface that the answer to that by saying that for all our major diseases such as HIV, TB, many cancers, we need combination treatments to really have major effects. We have seen that through the ages. Remdesivir could be the first step in building that combination, an important first step in building that combination. And if we can do that in a few months, then hopefully other trials which are testing other therapies which are then show equal effects, or similar effects, can be added to remdesivir to give us even larger effects and reduce that death rate from 12% down to 8% and even lower. Professor Mahesh Parmar from University College London, we appreciate you taking the time to talk to us. Thank you. Warren Buffett says \"the world has Billionaire investment guru changed\" for aviation - and has revealed that his Berkshire Hathaway investment fund dumped its shares in all four major US airlines last month. The conglomerate had a stake in major American airlines, including Delta and American. Mr Buffet also says US stocks could fall further. Max Wolff is a Market Strategist for Multivariate, a consulting firm in New York. what extent is Warren Buffett right Max, thank you for joining us. To that the world has changed for aviation. I know that this is a way out on the skinny branches type of comment, we have seen this hospitality space led by the airlines being down about 35 to 40%. I think the Americans have a spectacular what we call a dead cat bounce here, way out over any justifiable level, but even in that balance of general euphoria, you have seen the hospitality space lag, and airport spaces don't seem like they can be run with any kind of profitability at all, you can only have four passengers for 26 seats to comply with the rules, and they don't want to be in a metal tube breathing each other's exhalations, and we are also in the middle of a recession now which isn't good for the airline industry. How much further could stocks and airlines for? They don't look like they will fall back much further. Stocks are massively overvalued now, so the markets are going through this grieving process for an era where they had virtually costless borrowing money to buy back their own shares, which in retrospect is going to be the folly of the last couple of years. But I think the markets are probably due for a 35% fall from here at a broad level. It depends on which country in which stocks, because the big tech stocks dominate the American market indices, because they are a market cap weighted, so if you're bigger you count more, so are upon those stocks. But generally speaking, the markets are probably going to test the load. What is your advice to members of the public, people with pensions all wrapped up in stocks and shares, what should they be doing? They should be taking half of the risk, if they have just taken this whole ride down and back up again, I tell them to get at least half your money off the elevator. If you ride the elevator all day you will end up in the lobby. If you just ride it up and down and up and down and up and down, and endure the stress of the whole thing, you won't do that well. The basic profitability of big corporations around the world is going to be in for a tough several years, so do I think we will recover? Yes. Have we begun to recover?

Some of these kids have been out of school for as long as 26 weeks and their parents are looking for way to get them back class, but refusing to vaccinate their children. Green meadows Waldorf School in Rockland County, just went up against the Rockland County department of Health in court for that exact reason. So parents are definitely finding issue with this, but the county is standing strong and saying you need to vaccinate your kids and now with this state of emergency, taking it one step further, not only is your child not allowed in school if they are not vaccinated but now they are not allowed in any public space for 30 days. </p><p>OK, thank you very much for that update. The European Parliament has passed a controversial new law designed to protect copyright on the internet. Its supporters say the legislation will guarantee fair payment for artists, musicians and writers whose work is shared on networks such as Google or Facebook. But opponents argue the law will stifle internet freedom. Our media editor Amol Rajan has been investigating. DESPACITO BY LUIS PONSI FT DADDY YANKEE PLAYS Recognise that tune? Well, no wonder, this is probably the most watched video in human history with a mere 6 billion views on YouTube. Great marketing, but who picked up the bill? Not YouTube, that digital Narnia containing millions of videos, most of them free to view. As host platforms, companies like YouTube don't generally pay artists or publishers for their work. Today's ruling could change all that and return cash to the creators or owners of the content. It's based on two clauses within the EU Copyright Directive. Article 11 says search engines and news aggregators will have to pay to use links from news websites. Article 13 says large tech companies will be responsible for content they use without copyright. They will have to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. This potentially changes their very nature of the web. Many artists and publishers have campaigned strongly for the changes demanding payment for ideas and content which they created. But campaigners for the open Web and tech giants themselves who spend huge sums lobbying against the changes say this is a dark day for civil society across the globe. They add that these rules could be unworkable. There are important caveats here. The reforms have already been deleted and they remain short on vital detail. If approved by EU member states, each country will have two years to make the changes and of course Britain's future relationship with the EU is still unclear. This is really about competing visions of the World Wide Web. The internet model we have in the West today is dominated by a few mostly Californian giants. The coming iteration of the internet will probably be more regulated and less literally of a free-for-all while stopping short of the walled garden users occupy in places like China. Whether it is on competition rules, new data protection is or now copyright, it is Europe that is clipping the wings of big tech. The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-1080c5667b1242718910c4780a27d34b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-WCP1-JBH6-C0ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais' Chill October creates this wonderful atmosphere and you see Van Gogh actually, particularly when he's painting in autumn, trying for that same emotional accent. It has been said that the Van Gogh we know was born in London. \"Things are going well for me here,\" he said in a letter to his brother Theo. \"I have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?\" A job, as it turned out. He was sacked, which was a good thing in a way. He left Britain and decided to take up painting. Will Gompertz, BBC News. You can reach me on Twitter - I'm @DuncanGolestani. Hello there.

As host platforms, companies like YouTube don't generally pay artists or publishers for their work. </p><p>Today's ruling could change all that and return cash to the creators or owners of the content. It's based on two clauses within the EU Copyright Directive. Article 11 says search engines and news aggregators will have to pay to use links from news websites.

Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais' Chill October creates this wonderful atmosphere and you see Van Gogh actually, particularly when he's painting in autumn, trying for that same emotional accent. It has been said that the Van Gogh we know was born in London. \"Things are going well for me here,\" he said in a letter to his brother Theo. \"I have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?\" A job, as it turned out. He was sacked, which was a good thing in a way. He left Britain and decided to take up painting. Will Gompertz, BBC News. You can reach me on Twitter - I'm @DuncanGolestani. Hello there.

A touch of across parts of the West Country. South-east Wales, the south-west of England. Further north, not as chilly because there is more cloud. Through the day, we continue to bring these areas of cloud south-eastwards. A mixture of patchy cloud and sunshine for many. The best of the sunshine across Wales in the south-west. Equally the cloud across the far north and far north-west of Scotland.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais' Chill October creates this wonderful atmosphere and you see Van Gogh actually, particularly when he's painting in autumn, trying for that same emotional accent. It has been said that the Van Gogh we know was born in London. \"Things are going well for me here,\" he said in a letter to his brother Theo. \"I have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?\" A job, as it turned out. He was sacked, which was a good thing in a way. He left Britain and decided to take up painting. Will Gompertz, BBC News. You can reach me on Twitter - I'm @DuncanGolestani. Hello there. Don't expect any major changes in our weather over the next few days. There is more dry weather to come, some spells of sunshine and patchy cloud as well. One subtle difference, it is going to turn a little bit milder for a time at least. High pressure then sitting to the south of the British Isles. The winds allowing cloud to feed in over the top of that area of high pressure so we will continue to bring areas of cloud from the north-west towards the south of the UK through the first part of Wednesday. Best of the clear spells as we start off the day across southern and western parts of England and Wales, that's where we have the lowest of the temperatures. A touch of across parts of the West Country. South-east Wales, the south-west of England. Further north, not as chilly because there is more cloud. Through the day, we continue to bring these areas of cloud south-eastwards. A mixture of patchy cloud and sunshine for many. The best of the sunshine across Wales in the south-west. Equally the cloud across the far north and far north-west of Scotland. Temperatures generally 11-14 degrees, may be 15 in Aberdeen if we get some sunshine and shelter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SW-38d0b05b6db24da1b6c645004bd38090</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-WCP1-JBH6-C0MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais' Chill October creates this wonderful atmosphere and you see Van Gogh actually, particularly when he's painting in autumn, trying for that same emotional accent. It has been said that the Van Gogh we know was born in London. \"Things are going well for me here,\" he said in a letter to his brother Theo. \"I have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?\" A job, as it turned out. He was sacked, which was a good thing in a way. He left Britain and decided to take up painting. Will Gompertz, BBC News. You can reach me on Twitter - I'm @DuncanGolestani. Hello there. Don't expect any major changes in our weather over the next few days. There is more dry weather to come, some spells of sunshine and patchy cloud as well. One subtle difference, it is going to turn a little bit milder for a time at least. High pressure then sitting to the south of the British Isles. The winds allowing cloud to feed in over the top of that area of high pressure so we will continue to bring areas of cloud from the north-west towards the south of the UK through the first part of Wednesday. Best of the clear spells as we start off the day across southern and western parts of England and Wales, that's where we have the lowest of the temperatures. A touch of across parts of the West Country. South-east Wales, the south-west of England. Further north, not as chilly because there is more cloud. Through the day, we continue to bring these areas of cloud south-eastwards. A mixture of patchy cloud and sunshine for many. The best of the sunshine across Wales in the south-west. Equally the cloud across the far north and far north-west of Scotland. Temperatures generally 11-14 degrees, may be 15 in Aberdeen if we get some sunshine and shelter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-e234610f48c14ec2be5a70f5236997a7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-WCP1-JBH6-C0K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him.

Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais' Chill October creates this wonderful atmosphere and you see Van Gogh actually, particularly when he's painting in autumn, trying for that same emotional accent. It has been said that the Van Gogh we know was born in London. \"Things are going well for me here,\" he said in a letter to his brother Theo. \"I have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?\" A job, as it turned out. He was sacked, which was a good thing in a way. He left Britain and decided to take up painting. Will Gompertz, BBC News. You can reach me on Twitter - I'm @DuncanGolestani. Hello there.

One subtle difference, it is going to turn a little bit milder for a time at least. High pressure then sitting to the south of the British Isles. The winds allowing cloud to feed in over the top of that area of high pressure so we will continue to bring areas of cloud from the north-west towards the south of the UK through the first part of Wednesday. Best of the clear spells as we start off the day across southern and western parts of England and Wales, that's where we have the lowest of the temperatures. A touch of across parts of the West Country. South-east Wales, the south-west of England. Further north, not as chilly because there is more cloud. Through the day, we continue to bring these areas of cloud south-eastwards. A mixture of patchy cloud and sunshine for many. The best of the sunshine across Wales in the south-west. Equally the cloud across the far north and far north-west of Scotland.

Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais' Chill October creates this wonderful atmosphere and you see Van Gogh actually, particularly when he's painting in autumn, trying for that same emotional accent. It has been said that the Van Gogh we know was born in London. \"Things are going well for me here,\" he said in a letter to his brother Theo. \"I have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?\" A job, as it turned out.

Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais' Chill October creates this wonderful atmosphere and you see Van Gogh actually, particularly when he's painting in autumn, trying for that same emotional accent. It has been said that the Van Gogh we know was born in London. \"Things are going well for me here,\" he said in a letter to his brother Theo. \"I have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?\" A job, as it turned out. He was sacked, which was a good thing in a way. He left Britain and decided to take up painting. Will Gompertz, BBC News. You can reach me on Twitter - I'm @DuncanGolestani. Hello there. Don't expect any major changes in our weather over the next few days. There is more dry weather to come, some spells of sunshine and patchy cloud as well. One subtle difference, it is going to turn a little bit milder for a time at least. High pressure then sitting to the south of the British Isles. The winds allowing cloud to feed in over the top of that area of high pressure so we will continue to bring areas of cloud from the north-west towards the south of the UK through the first part of Wednesday. Best of the clear spells as we start off the day across southern and western parts of England and Wales, that's where we have the lowest of the temperatures. A touch of across parts of the West Country. South-east Wales, the south-west of England. Further north, not as chilly because there is more cloud. Through the day, we continue to bring these areas of cloud south-eastwards. A mixture of patchy cloud and sunshine for many. The best of the sunshine across Wales in the south-west. Equally the cloud across the far north and far north-west of Scotland. Temperatures generally 11-14 degrees, may be 15 in Aberdeen if we get some sunshine and shelter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YN-600309b0d6fd482bb686f03681a2ef45</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-WCP1-JBH6-C0MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402030</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"829\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais' Chill October creates this wonderful atmosphere and you see Van Gogh actually, particularly when he's painting in autumn, trying for that same emotional accent. It has been said that the Van Gogh we know was born in London. \"Things are going well for me here,\" he said in a letter to his brother Theo. \"I have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?\" A job, as it turned out. He was sacked, which was a good thing in a way. He left Britain and decided to take up painting. Will Gompertz, BBC News. You can reach me on Twitter - I'm @DuncanGolestani. Hello there. Don't expect any major changes in our weather over the next few days. There is more dry weather to come, some spells of sunshine and patchy cloud as well. One subtle difference, it is going to turn a little bit milder for a time at least. High pressure then sitting to the south of the British Isles. The winds allowing cloud to feed in over the top of that area of high pressure so we will continue to bring areas of cloud from the north-west towards the south of the UK through the first part of Wednesday. Best of the clear spells as we start off the day across southern and western parts of England and Wales, that's where we have the lowest of the temperatures. A touch of across parts of the West Country. South-east Wales, the south-west of England. Further north, not as chilly because there is more cloud. Through the day, we continue to bring these areas of cloud south-eastwards. A mixture of patchy cloud and sunshine for many. The best of the sunshine across Wales in the south-west. Equally the cloud across the far north and far north-west of Scotland. Temperatures generally 11-14 degrees, may be 15 in Aberdeen if we get some sunshine and shelter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-1499e75f7f424240b9f527cb5f238336</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-WCP1-JBH6-C0M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"799\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais' Chill October creates this wonderful atmosphere and you see Van Gogh actually, particularly when he's painting in autumn, trying for that same emotional accent. It has been said that the Van Gogh we know was born in London. \"Things are going well for me here,\" he said in a letter to his brother Theo. \"I have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?\" A job, as it turned out. He was sacked, which was a good thing in a way. He left Britain and decided to take up painting. Will Gompertz, BBC News. You can reach me on Twitter - I'm @DuncanGolestani. Hello there. Don't expect any major changes in our weather over the next few days. There is more dry weather to come, some spells of sunshine and patchy cloud as well. One subtle difference, it is going to turn a little bit milder for a time at least. High pressure then sitting to the south of the British Isles. The winds allowing cloud to feed in over the top of that area of high pressure so we will continue to bring areas of cloud from the north-west towards the south of the UK through the first part of Wednesday. Best of the clear spells as we start off the day across southern and western parts of England and Wales, that's where we have the lowest of the temperatures. A touch of across parts of the West Country. South-east Wales, the south-west of England. Further north, not as chilly because there is more cloud. Through the day, we continue to bring these areas of cloud south-eastwards. A mixture of patchy cloud and sunshine for many. The best of the sunshine across Wales in the south-west. Equally the cloud across the far north and far north-west of Scotland. Temperatures generally 11-14 degrees, may be 15 in Aberdeen if we get some sunshine and shelter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WM-ebf919fee8c84734a1fb7b8fca3ec94b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-WCP1-JBH6-C0MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402028</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"829\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Whether it is on competition rules, new data protection is or now copyright, it is Europe that is clipping the wings of big tech. The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Vincent Van Gogh is universally celebrated as one of the world's greatest artists - and now a new exhibition at Tate Britain aims to shine a light on the three years that he spent living in London. While in the capital he worked as an art dealer and although he didn't become a painter himself until four years after leaving Britain, those years were crucial to his artistic development. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz reports. Vincent Van Gogh came to Britain in 1873 - not to make art, but to sell it and see it. The 20-year-old art then dealer quickly developed an appreciation for British landscape painters, most notably John Constable. He settled here at 87 Hackford Road in Brixton, south-east London. He'd leave home and walk to work in Covent Garden every day because he wanted to take in the sights and the sounds and the smells of Britain. He'd often have some Charles Dickens in his pocket to read and always wore a top hat because, as he said, you couldn't be seen in London without one. Van Gogh took to London like a beard to a face. That is, it grew on him. In a West End gallery he discovered James Whistler's paintings, whose evening view of Westminster Bridge would inspire the Dutchman, when he eventually became an artist a few years later, to produce one of his most famous works. He found something in British art which he recognised as different from the art of his own country. The way particularly British landscape could evoke a feeling in the viewer. That was something he always wanted to do himself. Modern British artists, he noticed, were painting autumnal landscapes, and paintings like Millais' Chill October creates this wonderful atmosphere and you see Van Gogh actually, particularly when he's painting in autumn, trying for that same emotional accent. It has been said that the Van Gogh we know was born in London. \"Things are going well for me here,\" he said in a letter to his brother Theo. \"I have nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?\" A job, as it turned out. He was sacked, which was a good thing in a way. He left Britain and decided to take up painting. Will Gompertz, BBC News. You can reach me on Twitter - I'm @DuncanGolestani. Hello there. Don't expect any major changes in our weather over the next few days. There is more dry weather to come, some spells of sunshine and patchy cloud as well. One subtle difference, it is going to turn a little bit milder for a time at least. High pressure then sitting to the south of the British Isles. The winds allowing cloud to feed in over the top of that area of high pressure so we will continue to bring areas of cloud from the north-west towards the south of the UK through the first part of Wednesday. Best of the clear spells as we start off the day across southern and western parts of England and Wales, that's where we have the lowest of the temperatures. A touch of across parts of the West Country. South-east Wales, the south-west of England. Further north, not as chilly because there is more cloud. Through the day, we continue to bring these areas of cloud south-eastwards. A mixture of patchy cloud and sunshine for many. The best of the sunshine across Wales in the south-west. Equally the cloud across the far north and far north-west of Scotland. Temperatures generally 11-14 degrees, may be 15 in Aberdeen if we get some sunshine and shelter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-21b00071f6424f599fc932b0bbac1a30</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-WCP1-JBH6-C0KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We shoot the net over the drone. </p><p>We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone.

Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children to have an overview of their code with their hands. The woman leading the project is Cecily Morrison, a computer scientist at Microsoft's Cambridge research laboratory, who herself has a blind son. For blind and no-vision children specifically, the technologies that were available were not accessible to them, so many children now learn programming, starting at the age of seven, with block-base languages. The other aspect that we should not forget about is that we created this to be available to children regardless of their level of vision so that means that it is available to children who are blind with no vision, it's equally available for children who are sighted. That is one of the things that we were very aware of, is that we did not want to create a technology that isolated the blind or low-vision child at the back of the class, in a different classroom, doing their own thing. We wanted something they could engage with other children, encode together. But Code Jumper is only one solution to the issue of getting children with vision impairment to coding. Some of you are new to Apple iPad accessibility and coding so today we're going to run a session... At Linden Lodge, a school for children with sensory impairments in South London, I went to see how Apple have been working with the Royal National Institute for Blind People, to increase access to its own popular coding education app, called Swift Playgrounds. Apple is using its suite of accessibility tools already built into its iOS devices such as, voice-over, high contrast and large text in conjunction with much more old school assistive tech. It says go here, go here, go here. And that is where it is. They have created braille and tactile maps for each level of the app so blind children can navigate the whole screen area with their hands. There's clearly still a role for tactile maps and for images, and diagrams. Yeah, I think it is a healthy kind of dynamic mix of old and new and perhaps some experimentation as well.

The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children to have an overview of their code with their hands. The woman leading the project is Cecily Morrison, a computer scientist at Microsoft's Cambridge research laboratory, who herself has a blind son. For blind and no-vision children specifically, the technologies that were available were not accessible to them, so many children now learn programming, starting at the age of seven, with block-base languages. The other aspect that we should not forget about is that we created this to be available to children regardless of their level of vision so that means that it is available to children who are blind with no vision, it's equally available for children who are sighted. That is one of the things that we were very aware of, is that we did not want to create a technology that isolated the blind or low-vision child at the back of the class, in a different classroom, doing their own thing. We wanted something they could engage with other children, encode together. But Code Jumper is only one solution to the issue of getting children with vision impairment to coding. Some of you are new to Apple iPad accessibility and coding so today we're going to run a session... At Linden Lodge, a school for children with sensory impairments in South London, I went to see how Apple have been working with the Royal National Institute for Blind People, to increase access to its own popular coding education app, called Swift Playgrounds.
