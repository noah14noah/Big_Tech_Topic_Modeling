Wall Street sure is signaling that the power lies with tech companies, vaulting the stock of Amazon to close to $2,400 a share earlier this week, from $1,838 at the end of January. While the price fell on Friday to $2,286 a share, after Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said he would spend future profits on the coronavirus response, that still gives the company a value of $1.14 trillion.</p><p>And all the other Big Tech stocks, which were hit in the first weeks of the pandemic, also are on an upward march to the top of the market-cap heap. Microsoft at $1.32 trillion. Apple at $1.26 trillion. Alphabet at $900 billion. And Facebook at $577 billion.  This group now makes up just over 20 percent of the S.&amp;amp;P. 500, which is a flashing yellow signal of what is to come.</p><p>That is to say, we live in a country in which the very big tech firms will be the very big winners in the economy of the future, which still does not look like it will be so pretty for most people and many companies, too.</p><p>In a column about a month ago, I wrote about a problematic trend that would develop after the world had been turned upside down by the pandemic. \"There will be a culling of most competitors of these giants that will only strengthen the power and reach of the behemoths, eliminating pesky roadblocks to their further domination,\" I wrote about tech's leading companies, who have the money and the means to wait out the storm. \"This is obviously not a good thing in the long run.\"</p><p>But even if it is good that companies like Amazon and Google and Facebook and Apple have become an essential part of making it easier to shelter in place or to track the virus - thanks a bunch for food delivery, contact-tracing apps and lots of funny memes - there's much that's not good.</p><p>It's not good that we have set up an epic system of have and have-nots that could become devastating for innovative ideas and start-ups trying to get off the ground. Not good because too much of our data is in the hands of fewer. Not good because these fewer are largely unaccountable to those they serve and hard to control by governments that are elected by the people.</p><p>These are themes that I have repeated over and over since I started this column two years ago - trying to drill down on what unlimited power, Midas-like financial might, minimal oversight and very few actual consequences might mean for the rest of us. Contrary to some of the pushback I get when I say what I consider the obvious, I neither hate tech nor think most people who work in tech are bad people.</p><p>But when this crisis is over, I can say that we most certainly should fear Big Tech more because these companies will be freer than ever, with many fewer strictures on them from regulators and politicians. The effort to rein in tech companies had been building decent momentum before coronavirus outbreak, but it will be harder when focus needs to be on building up rather than breaking apart.</p><p>Now, as we turn to the healthy companies to help us revive the economy, it could be that the only ones with real immunity are the tech giants. In this way, Covid-19 has accelerated their rise and tightened their grip on our lives. And this consolidation of power, combined with Big Tech's control of data, automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, media, advertising, retail and even autonomous tech, is daunting.</p><p>Which is why politicians like Senators Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, and Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, have become very strange bedfellows in calling for more scrutiny of Big Tech of late. And House lawmakers on Friday were calling for Mr. Bezos to testify at a hearing on antitrust violations or face a subpoena. But the real actions the government takes are likely to feel ever limper.</p><p>Witness the $5 billion settlement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook that was approved by a judge this week. When it was announced last year, I called it a \"parking ticket.\" Today, it is like losing a dime for Facebook.</p><p>The judge, Timothy J. Kelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, noted the government's complaints that Facebook flouted the terms of a previous consent decree with the F.T.C. and called such behavior \"unscrupulous,\" even as he let the company slide into home with its sharpest spikes out.</p><p>The complaints about Facebook \"call into question the adequacy of laws governing how technology companies that collect and monetize Americans' personal information must treat that information,\" Judge Kelly wrote, adding that if it happened again, courts \"may not apply quite the same deference to the terms of a proposed resolution.\"</p><p>If the courts ever get such a shot again, that is. They won't with the current trajectory of Facebook, which has deftly used the pandemic as a redemption moment by doing its job on keeping bad health information off its platform.</p><p>Thanks a lot for that, but it is the lowest bar in my humble estimation. All of tech should do its part to stop the spread of misinformation, especially as the industry's power continues to grow.</p><p>That's why power and its uses and abuses, and what it should and could be, as well as what it means to be without it, will be the central organizing principle of a new podcast I will start in the fall with The New York Times. For the past five years, in more than 500 episodes, I have been trying to do that at Vox Media with my podcast \"Recode Decode\" by holding tech's feet to the fire as best I could. I have also tried to illuminate for listeners what wonder the future could hold if power were used in more creative, inclusive and, most important, more unusual ways.</p><p>Power doesn't necessarily have to corrupt, and this troubled time can show us what power can do when it is applied in different ways. Are giant corporations more powerful than the workers? Does money confer power, or does creativity? Do you need might to be powerful - or dexterity?</p><p>There are a lot of synonyms for power, including one that connotes dominance and one that points to potential. I hope to explore which way to go as we emerge from this virus prison.</p><p>As a 19th-century orator said about Abraham Lincoln, \"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.\"</p><p>To my mind, there is no better time to find out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

This group now makes up just over 20 percent of the S.&amp;amp;P. 500, which is a flashing yellow signal of what is to come.</p><p>That is to say, we live in a country in which the very big tech firms will be the very big winners in the economy of the future, which still does not look like it will be so pretty for most people and many companies, too.</p><p>In a column about a month ago, I <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI4WLHZNFmo\">wrote about a problematic trend</url> that would develop after the world had been turned upside down by the pandemic. \u201cThere will be a culling of most competitors of these giants that will only strengthen the power and reach of the behemoths, eliminating pesky roadblocks to their further domination,\u201d I wrote about tech\u2019s leading companies, who have the money and the means to wait out the storm. \u201cThis is obviously not a good thing in the long run.\u201d</p><p>But even if it is good that companies like Amazon and Google and Facebook and Apple have become an essential part of making it easier to shelter in place or to track the virus \u2014 thanks a bunch for food delivery, contact-tracing apps and lots of funny memes \u2014 there\u2019s much that\u2019s not good.</p><p>It\u2019s not good that we have set up an epic system of have and have-nots that could become devastating for innovative ideas and start-ups trying to get off the ground. Not good because too much of our data is in the hands of fewer. Not good because these fewer are largely unaccountable to those they serve and hard to control by governments that are elected by the people.</p><p>These are themes that I have repeated over and over since I started this column two years ago \u2014 trying to drill down on what unlimited power, Midas-like financial might, minimal oversight and very few actual consequences might mean for the rest of us. Contrary to some of the pushback I get when I say what I consider the obvious, I neither hate tech nor think most people who work in tech are bad people.</p><p>But when this crisis is over, I can say that we most certainly should fear Big Tech more because these companies will be freer than ever, with many fewer strictures on them from regulators and politicians. The effort to rein in tech companies had been building decent momentum before coronavirus outbreak, but it will be harder when focus needs to be on building up rather than breaking apart.</p><p>Now, as we turn to the healthy companies to help us revive the economy, it could be that the only ones with real immunity are the tech giants. In this way, Covid-19 has accelerated their rise and tightened their grip on our lives. And this consolidation of power, combined with Big Tech\u2019s control of data, automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, media, advertising, retail and even autonomous tech, is daunting.</p><p>Which is why politicians like Senators Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, and Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, have become very strange bedfellows in calling for more scrutiny of Big Tech of late. And House lawmakers on Friday were calling for Mr. Bezos to testify at a hearing on antitrust violations or face a subpoena. But the real actions the government takes are likely to feel ever limper.</p><p>Witness the $5 billion settlement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook that was approved by a judge this week. When it was announced last year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI4WLHZNFmo\">I called it a \u201cparking ticket.\u201d</url> Today, it is like losing a dime for Facebook.</p><p>The judge, Timothy J. Kelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, noted the government\u2019s complaints that Facebook flouted the terms of a previous consent decree with the F.T.C. and called such behavior \u201cunscrupulous,\u201d even as he let the company slide into home with its sharpest spikes out.</p><p>The complaints about Facebook \u201ccall into question the adequacy of laws governing how technology companies that collect and monetize Americans\u2019 personal information must treat that information,\u201d Judge Kelly wrote, adding that if it happened again, courts \u201cmay not apply quite the same deference to the terms of a proposed resolution.\u201d</p><p>If the courts ever get such a shot again, that is. They won\u2019t with the current trajectory of Facebook, which has deftly used the pandemic as a redemption moment by doing its job on keeping bad health information off its platform.</p><p>Thanks a lot for that, but it is the lowest bar in my humble estimation. All of tech should do its part to stop the spread of misinformation, especially as the industry\u2019s power continues to grow.</p><p>That\u2019s why power and its uses and abuses, and what it should and could be, as well as what it means to be without it, will be the central organizing principle of a new podcast I will start in the fall with The New York Times. For the past five years, in more than 500 episodes, I have been trying to do that at Vox Media with my podcast \u201cRecode Decode\u201d by holding tech\u2019s feet to the fire as best I could. I have also tried to illuminate for listeners what wonder the future could hold if power were used in more creative, inclusive and, most important, more unusual ways.</p><p>Power doesn\u2019t necessarily have to corrupt, and this troubled time can show us what power can do when it is applied in different ways. Are giant corporations more powerful than the workers? Does money confer power, or does creativity? Do you need might to be powerful \u2014 or dexterity?</p><p>There are a lot of synonyms for power, including one that connotes dominance and one that points to potential. I hope to explore which way to go as we emerge from this virus prison.</p><p>As a 19th-century orator said about Abraham Lincoln, \u201cNearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man\u2019s character, give him power.\u201d</p><p>To my mind, there is no better time to find out.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI4WLHZNFmo\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

Since then, it has had a significant impact on the way we live. It's brought sweeping changes to how we communicate, work, shop, date, and travel. In those early days, especially after the first dot-com bust, no one could truly envision what was to come. And as such, tech companies had a fairly open playing field. Relatively little regulation actually paved the way for innovation, and tech companies thrived. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft aren't called the \"Big Five\" for nothing. However, many of these technological and lifestyle shifts have come at a cost.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Significant innovation at a price?</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fast forward to today, where millions of us have willingly traded our privacy for free access to social networking platforms and other content. We carry around smartphones that we rely on for much more than phone calls. Data breaches and wide scale hacking are everyday occupational hazards for banks, social networks, entertainment companies and governments, to name a few. More than ever, it's important for us to speak the same language in order to formulate solutions that enable investment and innovation that benefit the individual.</p><p>We're now witnessing a reckoning among elected officials, Wall Street bankers and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to better understand each other. One example is the recent testimony given by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg on Capitol Hill. Utah Senator Orrin Hatch asked Zuckerburg, \"How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?\" To which Zuckerberg replied. \"Senator, we run ads.\" Tempting as it may be to look down at lawmakers' confusion about Facebook's business model, it's also not entirely off the mark. Plenty of consumers have a limited idea of how Facebook's business works, what happens to their personal data, and what they can do to tighten control over their privacy. Not just on Facebook, but across the various touchpoints we all make daily with the Internet.</p><p>Clearly there is still a disconnect. But increasing regulations means grappling with complicated questions. Namely, how do you balance the free thinking that has fueled the internet's success with laws that also rein it in? As PR professionals, we know the importance of communication and this situation is no different. There needs to be constant, open dialogue between all parties to agree on a set of regulations that will protect us but also continue to encourage the innovation which spurred the Internet in the first place.</p><p>The Internet Bill of Rights is proposing exactly that. It's a set of principles that gives users more control of their online lives while creating a better Internet economy. Representative Ro Khanna from California recently unveiled a list of 10 points he hopes will guide data privacy laws to protect U.S. citizens in today's digital age. It calls for, among other things, consumers' right to Internet service without the unnecessary data collection, notification in a timely manner if a company holding personal data has a security breach, opt-in permission for data collection and greater transparency in the collection of data and what it's used for by companies.</p><p>This is even more important because of what's at stake today. The Internet and data usage goes far beyond fake accounts on Twitter or cloned accounts on Facebook. There's more real-life implications we face. In the not too distant future, technological advances such as autonomous vehicles, remote surgery and augmented reality will demand even greater performance from the internet. With no predictable rules for how the Internet works, it would be very challenging to meet the requirements of these new technology advancements.</p><p>Bearing all this in mind, what does this mean for us as communications professionals? After the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica data breach in March, Facebook rolled out an ad campaign that harkens back to its roots and promises to do more to keep consumers safe and protect our privacy. Uber also released a campaign showcasing its new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, and his renewed commitment to Uber customers in an attempt to salvage its reputation after the former CEO was ousted.</p><p>The backlash these companies faced brought to light not only how influential big tech has become - the Big Five in particular - but how much sway they've gained with the public. Does this decline in brand reputation signify a shift in consumer confidence? Because customer privacy data is a major competitive edge of these companies, it means risk and uncertainty have increased. And in the wake of this decline, transparent communications remains crucial. Companies regardless of size need to do the right thing by their users and develop and maintain a strong and consistent accompanying message.</p><p>Consumer consensus is that it's long past time to see something like the Internet Bill of Rights put in place. And while historically, tech companies had opposed any sort of regulation, experts say that some kind of federal data privacy law is inevitable and more recently the tech industry seems to be on board. In September, executives from Amazon, Apple and others testified before the Senate Commerce Committee about concerns that lawmakers had over privacy and publicly declared support for a new federal privacy law. So, progress is being made. But lawmakers and tech companies will need to come together to answer the very important question of how we protect consumer privacy without stunting Internet innovation.</p><p>This Internet Bill of Rights is coming at a critical time. It's sparking much needed conversation between lawmakers, tech companies and consumers. We have a responsibility to protect the Internet and should want to uphold a just Internet because it's in our best interests to do so - not just to avoid a fine or persecution. As I mentioned, no one could have ever predicted what the Internet would become, and it's hard to imagine now where it will be in another 20 years.

Given the gravity and speed of the political, economic and social changes that we are seeing, it is vital to take a step back to reflect on the impact of these trends.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The purpose of this reflection is less to predict the future and more to consider different potential outcomes on key topics and to identify opportunities for course-correction in the short, mid and long term.</p><p>When faced with extraordinary circumstances, such as the current pandemic, governments often resort to extreme measures, including increased surveillance and restrictions of the freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, and the closing of space for civil society, the media and whistle-blowers.</p><p>However, the imperatives of social distancing may be accelerating the spread of digital forms of activism and participatory processes, such as citizen assemblies, or public hearings conducted online.</p><p>Emergency measures often include the temporary suspension of institutional checks and balances. Governments around the world have used the Covid-19 crisis to consolidate power, suspend oversight and accountability institutions, and in some cases to attack political opponents.</p><p>Depending on the context, the military may also gain an upper hand over civilian power holders, further exacerbating risks of authoritarian abuses. If this concentration of power outlives the pandemic itself, anti-corruption reformers and promoters of democracy ought to gear up for a back-to-basics kind of agenda, pushing for the reinstatement of the appropriate institutional checks and balances, transparency and ethics, fairness and integrity.</p><p>In the short term, countries will face clear corruption and governance challenges as emergencies put pressure on governments to procure life-saving equipment, creating fertile ground for fraud and corruption. These include shortage-induced bribery risks, overpricing, diversion of emergency response resources, and kickbacks in procurement processes. The private sector is an active player in this environment!</p><p>Reduced income, a reduction in manufacturing and increased risk aversion are factors contributing to a worsening of the economy. This is likely to contribute to the rise of the informal sector of the economy, as more people find themselves in precarious employment.</p><p>This may lead to a paradigm shift in the delivery of social and public goods expected from the state, such as health care, social security measures and even climate governance.</p><p>All these factors come with high corruption risks. In the short term, huge economic stimulus packages will have to be monitored to ensure they are being spent for the common good, rather than in the private interest of a few.</p><p>Another facet of the economic dimension relates to the possible spike in poverty and inequality. The pandemic is already hitting harder the poorest and most disadvantaged groups who tend to live in closer quarters and without adequate medical and social support.</p><p>Many will struggle with job losses and family burdens. Depending on how the economic stimulus bailouts are managed and disbursed, big corporations may end up benefiting, using the 'too-big-to-fail' argument, while the population at large foots the bill.</p><p>In the medium and long term, the corruption risks are associated with the wider power imbalances brought by inequality and the opportunities for state capture and undue influence by privileged groups in policy processes and decision-making.</p><p>Reliance on technology in daily life, together with the development of innovative responses to current global needs, might increase exponentially the influence and power of big-tech companies. However, increased recognition of their role in our lives may lead to a new consensus on the optimal extent and means of regulation. The corruption risks, primarily related to the undue influence of large corporations on the policy process and political advertising online, will very much depend on the outcome of government attempts to regulate the activities of such companies.</p><p>The negative impacts of illicit financial flows on public budgets, government effectiveness and even inequality had been increasingly recognized long before the Covid-19 health crisis. However, the pandemic has laid bare the devastating effects of stashing cash away in tax havens, while governments struggle to pay for basic services required to keep people alive.</p><p>The pandemic has brought to light the inability of multilateral bodies such as the UN Security Council, Group of 7, or the European Union to effectively coordinate the response to the crisis.</p><p>When looking at all these topics, it is clear that there are both opportunities and challenges ahead for anti-corruption, governance and development work.</p><p>Will we in the Integrity Initiative have to continue with our anti-corruption work? I am convinced that we have to!</p><p>If you agree, join us; if you disagree, tell me why.

Last week, Third Point Re insurance, which is backed by US hedge-fund manager Daniel Loeb, said it would merge with Sirius International Insurance Group in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $788 million. </p><p>The deal comes at a pivotal time for both companies. Third Point Re To Merge After Years Of Losses Early last year, reports Read More[3]  We don't have a strong opinion on whether the overall market is \"correct\" in this assessment, though we were surprised at how fast the market appeared to reach its level of optimism. Our overall economic assessment last quarter was that the short-term will be quite awful (massive unemployment, large reductions in spending and income), but once a vaccine becomes widely distributed, the economy should recover significantly. There will be some permanent changes, many being accelerated changes that were already happening: companies will be more flexible about people working from home; consumers will buy more groceries online; sales teams will video conference more and fly less; firms will outsource more of their computing (to the benefit of our Google and Microsoft investments). This continues to be our assessment, with some caveats. The federal stimulus the CARES Act[4] made a huge difference; even though unemployment soared and consumer spending fell, household incomes actually increased thanks to the unprecedented inflow of government aid. The Federal Reserve may have had an even larger impact on the fortunes of the largest companies, easing credit markets to the point where companies were able to raise enough cash to bridge them to an eventual recovery. Tragically, these government successes were not matched in the field of virus management. We now know from the rest of the world that a program of universal mask-wearing, social distancing, and the avoidance of prolonged periods indoors can dramatically reduce the virus's reproduction factor. Most developed countries have been able to reduce cases and manage some version of a reopening, but, unfortunately, our experience has been far worse. This leaves us navigating a strange interim period. For now, economic activity seems to hinge on case counts, plus the generosity of Congress and the Fed. If federal stimulus keeps flowing and people take distancing measures seriously, we could have a reasonably functional economy by late fall. If not, the economy will remain abysmal. How long this interim period will be\u2014and how long it will take to recover\u2014hinges on one thing that's almost impossible to predict: how soon we get an effective vaccine. Given the virus's rudimentary structure and how slowly it mutates, there will be a vaccine, although early versions might not be all that reliable or long-lasting, more akin to a seasonal, mostly effective flu shot than a foolproof measles vaccine[5] that lasts a lifetime. The problem is that vaccines are difficult to test. Vaccines are administered to the healthy, and only a small percentage of healthy people will develop the condition. Several candidate vaccines are due to begin Phase 3 testing at the end of this month, but our sense is that the soonest a vaccine becomes widely disseminated is the first half of next year\u2014and that's if we get lucky. Our guess is in a downside scenario, it could be closer to two years based on more traditional vaccine development methods. Until then, our economy will run below capacity\u2014far below in the absence of any effective treatments, moderately below if there are treatments but no vaccine. We're not basing our investment strategy on a fast or long recovery since we don't know the answer. We own businesses we expect to increase earnings and generate cash flow in either scenario. Total Returns as of June 30, 2020 (A) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bretton-Fund-2020-2.png\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bretton-Fund-2020-2.png</url> (A) All returns include change in share prices and, in each case, include reinvestment of any dividends and capital gain distributions. The inception date of the Bretton Fund was September 30, 2010. (B) The S&amp;#38;P 500[6] Index is a stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 leading companies publicly traded in the US stock market, as determined by Standard &amp;#38; Poor's, and captures approximately 80% coverage of available market capitalization. Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. You may obtain performance data current to the most recent month-endhere[7]or by calling 800.231.2901. All returns include change in share prices, reinvestment of any dividends, and capital gains distributions. Indices shown are broad-based, unmanaged indices commonly used to measure performance of US stocks. These indices do not incur expenses and are not available for investment. The fund's expense ratio is 1.35%.The fund's principal underwriter is Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC.Contributors to PerformanceIn the second quarter, investors drifted toward companies they deemed least impacted by\u2014and even benefited from\u2014the coronavirus: big tech. Google/Alphabet[8] was the biggest contributor to our performance, adding 1.8% to the fund, followed by Microsoft with 1.4%. Mastercard added 1.3%. The two laggards in the quarter were Ross Stores and Berkshire Hathaway, which each took off 0.1% from the fund. We have underperformed so far this year, mostly due to our exposure to two sectors hit hard by the pandemic: retail and banking. We've reduced our exposure to banking a bit by eliminating our entire Wells Fargo position. (We discuss Wells specifically below.) Our remaining bank holdings in Bank of America and JPMorgan were hurt by the Fed reducing interest rates. They were also helped by government actions that ensure end users of capital are able to honor their obligations. We are cautiously optimistic that these benefits will support earnings over time. We expect retailers like Ross and TJX to recover just fine, and based on recent anecdotal data (long lines outside T.J. Maxx stores), we think that recovery is already under way.Portfolio<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bretton-Fund-2020-1.pngWells\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bretton-Fund-2020-1.pngWells</url>Fargo Position SoldWe sold our entire Wells Fargo position, which we've owned since 2011, toward the beginning of the quarter. This wasn't an easy decision. On one hand, we believe the shares continue to be undervalued, and we are hesitant to sell into a market panic[9]. We also think the company will bring its costs in line with its competitors over the next few years. But we also feel the business is facing serious challenges. Pre-COVID, Wells wasn't growing nearly as fast as its competitors JPMorgan and Bank of America. It also hasn't been able to move past its regulatory issues as fast as we'd hoped, and we're not optimistic that it will speed up in the COVID era. Given we like Bank of America and JPMorgan better and already own them, we decided to sell our Wells stake. Our total loss was -7.9%, or -1.8% on an annualized basis. Our opportunity cost, unfortunately, was greater. We're in truly unprecedented times, but through all of this, we have confidence people will keep Googling things, using their Mastercards/Visas/Amexes, driving their cars, and buying new houses. As always, thank you for investing.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 12th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chaos in Hong Kong, once again, you are looking at a live video shot from outside the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as violent protests continue this morning. Police saying that the activists are leading the city to the brink of a total breakdown.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The strength of the U.S. economy on tap, President Trump speaking at the New York Economic Club today, as the public impeachment hearings will begin tomorrow. We're taking a look at the growing controversy over who could be called to testify.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The streaming wars heat up, the long-awaited Disney+ is here, what its deep library and new originals mean for the competition. And markets this morning, are seeking out new highs.</p><p>Take a look at the Futures this morning, showing a gain at the start of trading of Dow Futures up 18, S&amp;P Futures up 1 point, NASDAQ Futures up 7- 1/2, on top of another record high yesterday for the Dow. The Dow had its ninth record close of the year, yesterday, at 27,691.</p><p>Global markets this morning, also have a firmer tone, take a look at European indices, where the FT-100 is up 27, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 12, and the DAX Index in Germany is higher by 70 points.</p><p>President Trump reportedly ready to delay tariffs on European autos, in exchange for investments in the United States. In Asia overnight, markets were higher despite the unrest in Hong Kong, and uncertainty over trade deal with China. Japan was strong, the Nikkei, hitting a 13-month high due to strong earnings from construction companies, as you see, the Nikkei, best performer.</p><p>Another sign of economic weakness, however, in China, we have the auto sales report for the month, falling 5.8 percent in October. And more trouble for Juul to report, the company cutting costs by nearly $1 billion next year, and that will include reducing its workforce.</p><p>More privacy concerns for Google this morning, reports that the technology giant is gathering personal health records of millions of people, the alarming details, doctors and nurses were not told, nor were patients.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, and joining me to break it all down, Moody's Capital Markets chief economist, John Lonski, Campusreform.org editor-in-chief, Cabot Phillips, and Laffer Tengler Investments chief investment officer, Nancy Tengler. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>Yes, we're going to hear from President Trump later today, on the economy. We also have retail sales coming out later in the week, you mentioned that Wal-Mart's going to be reporting earnings as well, any cracks in the consumer that you see so far?</p><p>NANCY TENGLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, LAFFER TENGLER INVESTMENTS: I, you know, I think the consumer's in pretty good shape. We got lower taxes, lower oil prices, low interest rates, right? And then --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Higher wages.</p><p>TENGLER: Higher wages --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TENGLER: -- not as much as we'd all like, but higher. And so, I think Wal-Mart will be instructed because it's no longer just a low-income measure. It -- you know, with the e-commerce business growing in almost 40 percent a year, they own companies like Bonobos, higher end retailers (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TENGLER: So, I think this is going to be a really important report.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's important because retail sales were down last month, right John?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: Yes, they were, so it's really important that we have some, sort of, positive news on retail sales for October, that's consensus expectation, but they're not looking for much of an increase by retail sales.</p><p>And so, that on a year-over-year basis, the U.S. government's measure of retail sales running at about 3.5 percent --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: -- is good, decent, but no reason for us to worry about an overheating economy, the return of faster price inflation. A bit worried, though, about that 10-year yield --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: -- 1.7 percent, start of the month, now it's over 1.9, 1.95. That could create problems for housing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll see about that. We are covering the retail sales number and, obviously, rates, all week.</p><p>Our top story this hour is the impeachment inquiry. President Trump is set to speak at the New York Economic Club later today, one day before the impeachment hearings go public, Democrats hoping to make a case that the President pressured Ukrainian into investigating Joe Biden and his son, over allegations of corruption.</p><p>The President tweeted this morning, I will be releasing the transcript of the first, and therefore more important phone call with the Ukrainian president before week's end.</p><p>Joining us right now is the Washington Times opinion editor and columnist, and FOX News contributor, Charles Hurt. Charlie, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you think this plays out this week, with these public hearings?</p><p>HURT: Well, I think it's going to be really interesting, because if Democrats are able to actually capture the attention of regular voters and regular citizens, in America, to follow this long winding rabbit trail, that they have -- that they have constructed, that they -- that they think adds up to impeachment, I'll be very impressed. I think what will actually happen is, we'll have -- we'll have the hearings.</p><p>There -- you know, absolutely there's going to be a lot of attention paid to it, everybody's going to be covering this stuff, live.</p><p>But, very quickly, people are going to start losing interest, because it's so convoluted in a case where you don't, you know, not only do you not have a quid, you don't have a quo, and nobody understands what any of it -- how any of it, you know, amounts to impeachment in the first place.</p><p>I think -- I think it's going to be a big stage and it's going to be fun to watch how it turns out, but I really don't see American interests remaining terribly strong in it.</p><p>CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Hey, Charles, Cabot Phillips here, do you think there's a chance that this becomes Russia 2.0 where, you know, the Democrats really came in hot, saying there's clear evidence of collusion here, it's going to happen. And in a way, I think President Trump almost benefitted from that in the long run, being able to point to how out of touch they were.</p><p>Do you think that happens here where the Democrats overplay their hands, saying, we're going to have clear evidence, he's going to be impeached, and it doesn't end up happening and it ends up helping Trump in the long run.</p><p>HURT: I think that's absolutely what's going to happen here. And a big reason why, is because they did go through the Russia gate. They've gone through all these other things. They went through the Steele dossier. They've thrown all of these things at him.</p><p>And at some point, people -- even if you're not paying attention to every, you know, twist and turn the way -- the way many of us are. The fact that, you know -- that somewhere in your mind you know, that they have thrown everything at this guy, and the only common thread through all of it is, they want him removed from office.</p><p>Well, trying to undo the 2016 election, in the middle of the next election, basically, that they want to, sort of, delete the -- not only the 2016 election, but the 2020 election, because they don't think that they can beat him with open borders and socialism and all this kind of stuff. That shines through pretty clearly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HURT: And it's not a very good sell to voters, that oh, you know, in the middle of a campaign to go to voters and say, we want to take your vote away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HURT: It's not a very -- that's usually not successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here we are when Americans are going to go to the polls, in less than a year, but, you know, they also -- the process is being -- is being criticized, you know.</p><p>Lindsey Graham -- Senator Graham, as well as Congressman Kevin McCarthy, both joined me on Sunday, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" and they basically said, look, even if we want to call witnesses down for these public hearings, we've got to check with Adam Schiff.</p><p>Also, Adam Schiff made the rule change whereas, if you want to yield time, to your colleague, you can't do that. In the past, when you've got hearings, if Devin Nunes wants to yield his five minutes to John Ratcliffe, because John Ratcliffe is a former federal prosecutor and might be able to ask the questions better or get at the truth easier, Schiff said no.</p><p>You can't yield your time to anybody for the first 45 minutes, so there's that. I mean, Adam Schiff is putting in all these extra rules.</p><p>HURT: And, you know, if it -- you know, I've always believed that Americans -- they have a very, very keen sense of fairness. And when they see something unfair happening, you know, it has nothing to do with Donald Trump. You know, it's not unfair to Donald Trump per se. It's unfair to the American system of elections. It's unfair to the American voter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HURT: And that's the thing that's going on here. It's not that Donald, you know, Donald Trump -- the person is being denied something. It's that the vote that people cast --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HURT: -- whether you agree with it or not, you know, I couldn't count something like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the other thing is, that the Republicans want to question the whistleblower, so, you know, he or she is why we are here. The whistleblower had a problem, and unless the Republicans hire, you know -- are able to actually get to the crux of what the whistleblower knows of what he heard or what he -- what he didn't hear. This is what Lindsey Graham told me, Sunday. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): It's impossible to bring this case forward, in my view, fairly, without us knowing who the whistleblower is, and having a chance to cross-examine them about any biases that they may have. So, if they don't call the whistleblower in the House, this thing is dead on arrival in the Senate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For a long time, Adam Schiff said he wanted to speak to the whistleblower. Then, we found out that his staff actually did meet with the whistleblower. So, now he doesn't want to speak to the whistleblower in any of these hearings any longer. GRAHAM: Well, because what's going to happen, when you find out who the whistleblower is? I'm confident you're going to find out that somebody from the deep state. You're going to find out that they had interactions with Schiff, and these things going to stink to high heaven, and the only reason we don't know who the whistleblower is, that it hurts their cause. They're not trying to find the truth here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction, Charles?</p><p>HURT: You know, Lindsey Graham is exactly right about that. And, I think there are two reasons that they don't -- that Schiff suddenly doesn't want the whistleblower out there, one is, because of what he said, that now we know that they did speak beforehand or his office spoke to the whistleblower beforehand.</p><p>But the other thing is this, that it does begin -- you start to see a pattern here where the whistleblower -- the real problem that the whistleblower has, wasn't that call in particular. It's that the whistleblower has a problem with the President's policies and his agenda, in a place like Ukraine.</p><p>Well, you know who gets to set policy and agenda in Ukraine? The person that got elected, not some whistleblower that's disgruntled, but for some reason, had some position in the White House who probably shouldn't.</p><p>LONSKI: Quite frankly, Charles, the economy, business activity, consumers and financial markets, could care less about this impeachment investigation. And I think that is going to continue to be the case. Any thoughts?</p><p>HURT: And, you know, that's a real problem, I think, because you know, obviously, the whole active impeachment should be and is a very, very serious thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HURT: In fact, that the people who -- that who are kind of the most serious in our economy, aren't even paying attention to it because they think it's such a farce, and they think it's such a joke, that's a real degradation of our political system because impeachment was not meant to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: A joke.</p><p>HURT: -- a tool to beat up people that we disagreed with. It was meant to be a tool that was -- a tool of last resort, meant to remove somebody who is -- who is a real danger and a real criminal that, you know, that voters themselves would be in favor of removing, if we had an election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>HURT: That's not what's going on here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's very well said. Charles, great to have you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>HURT: Great to be with you. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Charles Hurt, joining us there. Joining the conversation this morning, the Chief of Staff to Vice President Mike Pence, is here, Marc Short. He'll weigh in Hong Kong and impeachment, the co-founder of HealthCare.com, CEO of PivotHealth, Jeff Smedsrud, on healthcare in America today, and the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney, will weigh in as well.</p><p>Don't miss the rest of the hour here. First, we will slip in a short break. And then, Google has got a big secret, the technology giant reportedly collecting the personal health data of millions of Americans without notifying doctors or patients.</p><p>Then, this, Disney just can't wait to be king, it's revving up the streaming wars with the launch of Disney+, how it's impacting the competition, next up. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It is a big day for Disney, launching its long- awaited streaming service Disney+. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at Disney and the other movers today. Hey, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. That's right. So, trouble in the house of the mouse. Let me tell you, right now, Disney+ experiencing unable to connect errors. This from the Verge that says reports of errors spiking across Twitter this morning, as the East Coast wakes up and starts trying to sign on. So, I'm sure they'll have something to do about that. It could be a good sign for Disney as they launch their streaming service. We have from Eagle Alpha. I know you've been looking for the number of people who are signing up. They are an aggregator of alternative data. They say the Disney system getting traction this morning as they look at tweets, 5 million tweets.</p><p>Meanwhile, a lot is riding on this launch, of course, we know that they have Marvel Disney, Lucasfilm, Pixar, these franchises are huge. They're offering it for 6.99. That's almost the lowest price out there. Only Apple is lower, and they're using all the power of their vast library and nostalgia to put this forward. Meanwhile, Barons is saying that Disney expects 90 million subscribers in five years. That's a forecast from the company itself. And they don't expect Disney+ to turn a profit in the next five years either. So, lots going on this morning. We've got unable to connect errors for Disney+ out there, but the stock moving up very handily. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri, thank you. Disney starts today. What do you think, are you going to buy it?</p><p>TENGLER: Yes. Buy the service or buy the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the service.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes, of course, I am.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You own Disney stock, right?</p><p>TENGLER: I do. I do indeed, yes. I'd like to -- Lance said earlier today from Lifewire -- Ulanoff -- when he said he had a box of VHSs, and that's exactly how it was in my house. I just got rid of them. So, it'd be fun to plug back in. I want to see Dumbo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And now, it's a very competitive situation. As I've been saying, the $15 billion, you know, price tag that Netflix is going to have to write that check every year is going to be -- is tough. We'll see if markets like that.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: Content is king. You know, this past week, we just upgraded the credit rating of Viacom because of the merger with CBS. They're going to have a lot of market power in this particular space.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Average American has 3.8 streaming services for just for themselves per household. So, I think there is plenty of room to grow there. My big problem is always remembering my different passwords for streaming services.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TENGLER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TENGLER: I have zero, by the way.</p><p>PHILLIPS: It's streamlining there, it make things easier.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You mentioned rates earlier, John, that the 10-year was at 1.7 percent creeping up to 1.9 percent.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You think markets will get upset if rates keep --</p><p>LONSKI: I think if it heads up over two percent, yes, they are going to start to become worried that perhaps borrowing costs are becoming too burdensome, especially in the housing market, the mortgage market. We had a strong run of late by the -- by housing sector share prices. But recently that particular price index, stock price index, has been declining in response to worry over how high bond yields might climb.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And mortgage rates, low mortgage rates have certainly helped the housing market last couple of months.</p><p>LONSKI: They have. And of course -- but you know, oddly enough, we have a very wide difference and an unusually wide difference between the mortgage yield, 30-year mortgage yield, and its benchmark Treasury yield. And the suppliers of a mortgage credit say that that reflects a very strong demand for mortgage credit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: But we'll wait and see how this plays out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm surprised we didn't talk more about the auto story, auto loans, this auto part of corner of the market. I was just touring The Journal yesterday, and when I went home and I was reading through it, I thought, Oh, you know what, this could be a worry sign. One guy that they -- that they talked about in the article yesterday, he bought a Jeep, it was $25,000, but unfortunately his loan was up to $48,000. He kept taking out loans to buy the car, and he ends up doubling the price of the car with all these loans. People need to understand that -- what they're doing with auto loans.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes, she's a little bit foolhardy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it really does.</p><p>LONSKI: Over the top. With auto loans, you look at the federal funds rate, that's moved lower, that should be helping auto sales. We hope it does fairly soon. But we do have a global slump of auto sales. We had evidence of that today with news from China, auto Sales being down. You've got to be concerned about that sector. You're not going to get a healthy recovery by manufacturing until auto sales grow again globally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, we are focused on the violence in Hong Kong this morning. It escalated overnight. Police say that the city has been pushed to the brink of a, quote, total breakdown. Protests now erupting into a -- the work week as well, not just the weekends.</p><p>Chief of Staff of Vice President Mike Pence is here, Marc Short, will weigh in on how the administration will respond to this. Then, big tech targets healthcare, Google reportedly collecting the personal health data of millions of Americans neither patients nor doctors have been notified. Everything you need to know when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Google reportedly gathering personal health information from millions of Americans. The technology giant apparently began the so-called \"Project Nightingale\" in secret last year, as part of its partnership with the Ascension Health System. That's going to The Wall Street Journal. Joining us right now is the co-founder of healthcare.com and the CEO of Pivot Health, Jeff Smedsrud. And Jeff, it's is great to have you on the program this morning. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>JEFF SMEDSRUD, CEO, PIVOT HEALTH: Well, it's great to be here. Thanks you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know that it's enrollment period, and this time is always confusing for people. So, we were invested in our audience. We want to make sure we're giving them as much information as possible during enrollment season. So, we're going to get to that in a second.</p><p>First, tell us your reaction to the story this morning, the top story in the Journal that Google is getting the medical records of many millions of Americans, already 150 people who work at Google have all the data of medical things like lab results. What's your reaction to this?</p><p>SMEDSRUD: Well, I think there's a massive amount of good that can come from big data, but a massive amount of mischief, as well. And we have to understand that it's -- that data belongs to me. It's our data. And the important thing for policymakers and for companies like Google and for all of us is, how are we going to deal with this amount of data and the regulations that we have that protect data are very old, 1996, HIPAA. Most of the insurance regulations that govern health insurance and life insurance, 1998 was the last time they've been changed. So, we need relevant regulations, and a discussion about the positives and potential negatives.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, Google says it is gathering all this information so that it could come up with a design, a new software. Look, I know that technology has enabled us to live longer, and that's wonderful. We're getting ahead of disease. But shouldn't patients and doctors have been notified that they were collecting all this data on it?</p><p>SMEDSRUD: Well, I think it's our data. It's personal data. And it needs to be used correctly, and it has to have our permission. And that is where there's a massive amount of mischief that comes into play with all of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, let's talk about open enrollment. Americans are starting to sign up for 2020 health care plans through their employers and the federal government. Many times, it's hard to know which plan is best. Your company does that, healthcare. com. Tell us about the options and what people need to understand during open enrollment season?</p><p>SMEDSRUD: Well, at healthcare.com, we helped millions of consumers shop, we show them different plans. We have more than 200 articles on our Web site that give some ideas about what to look for in plans. For open enrollment this year, several things to remember: One, the plan you have may not be the best plan. Prices change, networks change. Secondly, make sure you shop around. Third, understand if you're subsidy eligible or not subsidy eligible. The market is bifurcating between those that are subsidy eligible, below 400 percent of the poverty level, and those that are not. And there's different options for people based on their income.</p><p>Also, remember, there's no mandate, so there's no requirement that you buy a particular type of health insurance. And so, you can tailor plans to meet your specific needs. And last, I'd say the job of government is to set the rules and regulations, the job of consumers is to do what's best for each of us using those rules and regulations. So, shop, compare, look at your options, you're in charge, but most importantly, buy some type of insurance. Don't be uninsured.</p><p>TENGLER: So Jeff, what is an Alyssa Warren's Medicare for all plan do to your business model, if anything?</p><p>SMEDSRUD: Well, I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's going to eliminate 180 million people's health insurance, right? Because she's doing away with the private health insurance.</p><p>SMEDSRUD: That's the sound bite. But the reality is if you look at Medicare, what makes Medicare popular, introduce popular to a lot of people, the private sector makes Medicare popular. Medicare is popular because of Medicare Advantage, run by the private sector.</p><p>TENGLER: Right.</p><p>SMEDSRUD: It's popular because of Medicare Supplements run by the private sector. It's popular because of Part D run by the private sector. If you take all the private sector initiatives out of Medicare, it's a broken system. So, I don't think it's feasible. And I think if you had a Medicare For All, you'd have a Medicare Supplement for all.</p><p>TENGLER: Right.</p><p>SMEDSRUD: And there's nothing that really changes in that.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes, and that happened in the U.K., right? I mean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMEDSRUD: Absolutely.</p><p>TENGLER: -- private plans that -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nothing changes even after $52 trillion, the cost of Medicare For All.</p><p>TENGLER: Exactly.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The cost.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMEDSRUD: Let the private sector spend some of that money way more effectively by creating new technology, by creating tools, by giving people more choice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Jeff, it's great to have you. Thanks so much.</p><p>SMEDSRUD: Hey, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks for the advice on open enrollments, as well. Jeff Smedsrud. Check out healthcare.com. Quick break, then violence in Hong Kong escalating overnight. Police say that the city has been pushed to the brink of a, quote, total breakdown. Chief of Staff to Vice President Mike Pence is here, Marc Short to weigh in. Then, how the administration is responding. Then, wicked weather slammed the United States and American Airlines flights skidding off the icy runway in Chicago. The chilling moment, plus the latest forecast for you, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, November 12th. Your top stories right now. 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast. There was chaos in Hong Kong overnight once again. These are live pictures as nighttime descends on the city. Police said that rioters have committed insane acts including throwing trash onto train tracks and power lines, paralyzing the transportation system. Bringing the city to the brink of a total breakdown.</p><p>Tapping the brakes on tariffs, President Trump reportedly ready to delay tariffs on European autos. The White House reaction coming up. And market this morning are higher seeking out new highs. In fact, the Dow futures are up 13 points, the S&amp;P futures are up half a point. The NASDAQ futures up seven but this is on top of another record setter yesterday where the Dow Industrials finished in uncharted territory.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices are higher across the board. FT-100 is up 30 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 14 and the DAX Index in Germany is higher by 68. In Asia overnight, markets will hire despite the unrest in Hong Kong and some uncertainty of a trade with China. The Nikkei hit a 13-month high due to strong earnings. As you can see the Nikkei average up almost one percent.</p><p>However, there was another sign of economic weakness in China. Auto sales were down 5.8 percent in the month of October. The deep freeze is coming. The majority of the country feeling the chill already. Plus, a scary landing for one flight in Chicago sliding off the runway. We've got all those stories coming up.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, Hong Kong in crisis mode. The city rocked by brutal protests for six straight months showing no signs of stopping. Police today fired tear gas and Hong Kong's financial district and on two university campuses. A police spokesman said that the city has been pushed to the brink of a total breakdown. Joining me right now is the Chief of Staff for Vice President Mike Pence, Marc Short is here. Mark, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>MARC SHORT, CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Maria, thanks for having me on this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are there any plans on the part of the administration to react to what's taking place in Hong Kong?</p><p>SHORT: Well, Maria, I think the administration has spoken out several times talking about the need to resolve this peacefully. And calling on both the protesters and the Chinese government to resolve it peacefully. This is agreement that was signed 35 years ago to make sure that the situation in Hong Kong is one that the China respects the independence and we're calling on China again to make sure that they help to make sure that this is resolved peacefully that people have the right to protest and that those are preserved and protected.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, you know, one of the issues is that this is a lot of young people Marc, and they're looking at their future. And they're saying I don't want to be under authoritarian rule. That's not why I'm in Hong Kong. As China seems to be breaking another promise toward keeping Hong Kong independent which was the promise in the hand over to the British.</p><p>SHORT: Right. Well, I don't want to get too far ahead, Maria. I think that we agree that they need to make sure that those the agreement they signed with the Brits are -- is maintained and protected. And I think that that's an indication as to how they will conduct other agreements across the globe when other -- in other trade deals and other agreements.</p><p>I think that this administration has spoken out and you heard the vice president just a couple weeks ago and important speech lay out a lot of our concerns of the Communist Party of China is not entered into sort of the 21st century and not entered into agreements on the national stage. Yet at the same time, we recognize the China is a -- is a global power and we need to make sure that we're finding ways to move forward with them in a constructive pathway.</p><p>But there's no doubt that there's a lot of concerns of this administration has expressed about China's affront on human rights abuses, as well as where it is on a national security perspective, the threats that oppose the peaceful nations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And frankly, you know, President Trump and Vice President Pence have completely changed the conversation on this. You know, we had - - we had a survivor of Tiananmen Square on the set earlier, Rose Tang, and she said that there are naked bodies floating in the river that there are mysterious disappearances of people and she went on to say that, you know this -- the Uyghurs are in concentration camps.</p><p>Do all -- do any of these human abuses come into the conversation as the leadership of the country, President Trump, Vice President Pence are trying to do a trade deal with China. Does this matter that the fact that you've got almost two million Muslims in in concentration camps right now because they're not allowed to be Muslim, they want to follow the Chinese leadership, want them to be Chinese?</p><p>SHORT: Absolutely, Maria. I think that it's become part of the conversation and again, the Vice President's speeches a couple weeks ago for your viewers too, he talked about the persecution of the Uyghur Muslims as well as persecution of Christians and the human rights abuses that happened in China. And as you recall, he made a very simple comment, in fact about as well that the NBA came down on one of the general managers for the Houston Rockets who was standing with the people of Hong Kong and he was silenced.</p><p>And I think there's an irony that a lot of the people who are persecuted in China are sent away to concentration camps as you say, never to be heard from again, but here in America, if you speak out, then you get silenced and shame. So we do -- we do with the submission has spoken out, and it continues to speak out. But at the same time, I think there's a recognition that we can't decouple the economies entirely.</p><p>And so guess, we're speaking out and saying, we want to see these abuses fixed. But it's not -- it's not a retreat that says we can't still have trade deals. It's just that we want to make sure that human rights abuses are acknowledged. We want to make sure that they're fixed. We want to make sure as well that so many of the things that China's on economic front from cheating on trade deals and devaluing is currency that those are resolved too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Let me bring it back to the United States domestic issues. The President is expected to speak later today at the economic club of New York. Fox Business is carrying that speech live. I'll be there as well. What should we expect to hear from the President today?</p><p>SHORT: Well, Maria, I think that we have a lot to be proud of that since Donald Trump has been elected president, more close to seven million new jobs and then create in this economy, unemployment's all-time lows for African-Americans, all-time lows for Hispanic Americans, all-time lows for Asian-Americans. This economy continues to be a booming economy.</p><p>In addition, wage increases is something that we probably don't speak about enough. But despite inflation being low, we've seen significant rise in wage increases, particularly for those in the middle income sector. So there's a lot that we can talk about. The press I think will talk about the benefits of the anti-regulatory agenda, this administration, as well as tax reform, and I think he'll give a signal ahead as to what we can expect on the trade front.</p><p>As you've covered many times while Congress continues to pursue sham investigations. What it means is they've not done the things, they promised voters they would do in 2018. They promise they work with this administration on lowering drug prices. They promise they work with this on infrastructure, and they also promise they work with us on trade deals. And we remain anxious to complete some of these trade deals to keep this economy going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You mentioned the stronger wages. Wages are up over the last year and the economy is growing. Partly the needle moved as a result of the President's policies, no doubt about it. But people are worried about the consumer. We got retail sales coming out later this week. Wal- Mart is going to be reporting its earnings as well. Do you see any cracks in the consumer right now, Marc?</p><p>SHORT: No, I think in fact, just this month, the consumer sentiment number was strong again, we remain encouraged by that. And, you know, another statistic, Maria, is that the average family since Donald Trump was elected has seen income increased by $5,000 per year. That's a remarkable number. And so we think that that's continuing to fuel a lot of the consumer sentiment this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But as you know, there are worries that everything that the President and this administration has done to lift all boats in terms of the economy and his deregulation efforts may be taken away because of the tariffs. President Trump reportedly expected to once again delay tariffs on European autos. What can you say about that? He could announce those plans during his speech today.</p><p>The European Union now commenting on the development but if we were to get a tariff on European autos going into the very busy holiday season, wouldn't that be a big negative for the economy? Is the President going to announce that he'll delay that?</p><p>SHORT: Well, Maria, you know, I can't get in front of the President on that. So I think you have to stay tuned for his remarks. But I think that so far, what you've seen is this President has been able to reset many of the trade deals in which countries were taking advantage of the United States and try to provide a fair or more level playing field to protect the workers in this country.</p><p>And he's been able to do it with the economy continuing to grow. And so, I have confidence that will continue to be the case. I think what stands in front of us, though, is again, one of the largest trade deals are two largest exporters are Canada and Mexico, and we have a trade deal in place but rather than actually passing legislation that will help the American people, Democrats want to stay focused on sham investigations. That's the first thing we can actually do to continue to improve the trade front.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I -- you make a good point. I mean, at this point, Nancy Pelosi said that she said on a path to yes. Should we read into that that USMCA is going to come to the floor by year end?</p><p>SHORT: We're hopeful it will, Maria. I think that some of us are more cynical this process think that she's facing a lot of pressure from many of her moderate democrats who need to show that they're willing to work with this administration. And I think she's probably using this leverage on the impeachment vote. So, I think probably the timing of those two will be pretty close. And so we would hope that it would be done by the end of this year.</p><p>But it's a pretty cynical way to run this Congress, when in fact, there's legislation that can help American workers and help the middle class but basically, it's being used as leverage with impeachment votes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the impeachment is on. They're going to do public hearings this week. Democrats want to make a case that the President pressured Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son over the allegations of corruption. The President tweeted this morning, I will be releasing the transcript of the first and therefore more important phone call with Ukrainian president before weeks end.</p><p>So, is there any reason to believe that, you know, the President's first phone call and that transcript is going to put him in a worse position?</p><p>SHORT: Oh, no, I think that releasing that transcript only will benefit the president. But Maria, for your viewers, just to pull back for a second. You know, this administration has made the case that it's a sham investigation and more or less the star chamber because the head of the investigation, Adam Schiff, has lied to the American people about cooperating with the whistleblower.</p><p>He's providing fake testimony in front of his committee and the American people, they've not allowed due process for our administration to provide witnesses to this point, or to see the evidence has been brought forward. That's a total sham and people in America will know what is fair and what's not fair. But pull back for a second and when you get past the process, step back and say, so this is an impeachment about money that was released within the fiscal year about claiming a cover-up when the President has provided the entire transcript for all the American people to read?</p><p>And the President Ukraine said he felt no pressure or whatsoever from the president. I think it's kind of hard for American people to say, this is what you're pursuing, instead of lowering my drug prices, instead of getting legislation done to help our infrastructure, instead of passing trade deals, I think that's a very difficult situation. I think the Democrats have put themselves in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the President has been, you know, walking on eggshells from the beginning of his -- of his presidency, whether it'd be the steel dossier and the efforts to frame him, or what Nikki Haley told us, you know, she's embracing President Trump as she promotes her new book. Is there any truth to the recording reports that she's eyeing a spot as Trump's vice president in 2020?</p><p>SHORT: Oh, I think that this vice president and this president enjoy a remarkable relationship that has benefited the American people. And we look forward to them being on the ticket together in 2020. And the Vice President has been pleased to accept the President's invitation to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what about the deep state? How significant are these people within the White House that are against this president, Nikki Haley is telling the story about how, you know, Rex Tillerson and John Kelly basically pressured her to go along with them to go against the president and his policies?</p><p>SHORT: Well, look, I think that General Kelly is an American hero and I think that, you know, this weekend we honor our veterans and we honor his service to our country, we honor the fact that his son died in service to our country on this weekend. And so, I never witnessed that from John Kelly and I -- and I can't speak to the relationship she had with Rex Tillerson, but certainly, I never witnessed that from John Kelly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Marc, we look forward to all of the above. The President speaking today. And of course, the ramp up to 2020. Good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>SHORT: Thanks, Maria. Thanks for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Marc Short is at the White House this morning. Coming up. The strength of the U.S. economy. President Trump gears up to speak at the Economic Club of New York today. The Chief of Staff to Vice President Mike Pence, Marc Short just told us, the President will discuss wage increases, benefits of an antiregulatory agenda and tax reform. Stuart Varney weighs in on that.</p><p>And then, Wendy's celebrate its 50th Birthday unveiling its first all new frosty flavor ever. We've got the scoop. Back in a minute</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump will speak later today in New York at the Economic Club of New York. Fox Business will carry that speech live. Investors are watching for any comments on the trade talks with China. Joining me right now as the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney to weigh in here. Hey, Stu, good morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I'm jealous, Maria. I am profoundly jealous because you're going to be there. And I'm not. It's six blocks up the road here in the Hilton Hotel. He starts at 12 noon. I can't get there in time because my show ends at 12:00 noon. And the Secret Service says you got to be there at 11:00 to go to the metal detectors. So, I can go and you can.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARNEY: What are you going to save yourself?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm also a member of the New York Economic Club. So I go to a lot of these things.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, OK. Well, I don't. Oh, I'm not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Going to be invested from the beginning thing now.</p><p>VARNEY: OK, OK, OK. This could be a market mover, Maria. And I'm sure you'll agree with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: Whatever he says on trade, one way or the other, I think will move the market. And I think he's going to use this speech as sort of a campaign focus for the next year, as he -- as he tries to keep the prosperity rolling as you get towards the next election. I think this is probably the single most important economic speech of the year, if not his first term. What do you say?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I think you're right, Stu, because it's all good news when you look at the impact on the economy, right? Whether it be the deregulation efforts, his -- remember that shot of him when he had all the -- all the rules and regulations piled up? You were there that day I think. You were there with him.</p><p>VARNEY: Didn't you go? It was in 2016 I think when he addressed the economic club and he just unleashed a tirade against China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>VARNEY: Now he's coming back, maybe with some news on positive trade developments with China, it's fantastic, isn't it, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That will be what we're going to be focused on.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What he has to say about China. We'll see about that. Stu, we'll be watching market reaction and I'll be tweeting about it. How's that?</p><p>VARNEY: OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I'll text you as well.</p><p>VARNEY: You're wrong. You're wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll text you from the stage.</p><p>VARNEY: You're wrong. I'll take it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks, Stu. I know you'll have a lot more in 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you at the top of the hour. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNING WITH MARIA. But first, wicked weather slamming the United States. Hundreds of flights have been canceled in the U.S. Thousands of delays affecting travelers. The very latest forecast when we come back. Plus, this, Wendy's celebrates its 50th birthday unveiling its first all-new frosty flavor ever. We've got the scoop after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. An arctic blast is coming. Several parts of the country being slammed right now by bitter cold conditions and snow. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I was saying Winter is coming now. Winter is here. We could see records today, Maria, shattered freezing temps like any much of the country. Nearly six inches of snow already fell in Chicago yesterday and a plane slid off an icy runway over O'Hare.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh. No, no, no, no. Oh. Hey.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we landed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Yes. They landed eventually. Well, the gear snapped on this American Airlines flight. Nobody was hurt but the incident and the weather caused more than 2000 flight cancellations throughout the Chicago area. Snow falling as far, south as Arkansas, the cold weather pushing East right now bundle up New York City.</p><p>All right. Amazon is growing its grocery business. The company is opening its first low-cost store in Los Angeles. They're going to stand apart from the upscale Whole Foods they think which Amazon of course bought in 2017. Digital stores expected to open in Chicago and Philadelphia. There's Amazon of the premarket pretty much flat. A little bit of green on your screen.</p><p>And then there is this. Wendy's is celebrating the big 5-0, with the birthday cake flavored frosty. Oh yes. First new flavor since Wendy's introduced those originals which as, you know, Maria, come in chocolate and vanilla. All I can say is send it back to you as yes, please.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's good. Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We got final thoughts from this all-star panel when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts in this all-star panel right here. What are you thinking about?</p><p>TENGLER: I'm thinking about the next 12 months. Earnings, we got out of it alive, this last quarter, we got an earnings risk premium that bodes well for stocks in the future. We've had three rate cuts. That is -- if it's a pause at this point, that's good for stocks. So I think this has bit to run, acts any kind of impeachment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see what the president says today, Nancy.</p><p>TENGLER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cab, what about you?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Thinking about the demonization of wealth in America, every democrat candidate is trying as hard as they can to make it seem like you're an evil person. If you amass wealth, I think free market advocates need to do a better job of reminding the next generation. It's not a zero sum game. You don't get rich by making other people worse off, you get rich by bringing everyone up with you.</p><p>Providing things they need. We need to be better on that message or remind people there's nothing wrong with wealth. That's what makes America --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. I love that. You're absolutely right. Go ahead, John.</p><p>LONSKI: A record long economic recovery is not about to end anytime soon.

But the most successful brands in this category are and will continue to be those that recognize the importance of human-powered service. These brands will win customer trust for the long run by supplementing and enriching their tech solutions with knowledgeable human employees.    Let's examine why humans are so important to the success of fintech, and I\u2019ll offer tips for fintech brands hoping to succeed over the long haul.    Money is personal.     We\u2019ve all heard personal finance experts insist that money is a tool. But for most people, money is also deeply emotional. Our perceptions of and attitudes about money are affected by our upbringing, society, personal experiences and moment in history.     Then there\u2019s the reality that the things money allows us to do are often deeply emotional: Buying a home, for example, is commonly referred to as the \u201cAmerican Dream.\u201d     When it comes to these highly emotional transactions, most Americans don\u2019t want to rely on technology alone: While 72% of people prefer a digital mortgage application, for example, 65% also want a human around to answer their questions.    This isn\u2019t a phenomenon isolated to generations that grew up before the iPhone, either. A recent study of Gen Z (those born after millennials) found that 79%  expect to want to conduct the homebuying process face to face when they\u2019re ready for that milestone.    The takeaway for fintech startups: Know the benefits and limits of technology. Because of the emotional nature of the kinds of transactions we enable in fintech, it\u2019s crucial to support experience-enhancing technology with experienced human support.    Relationships \u2014 and trust \u2014 matter.    Fintech gets a lot of attention for the way it\u2019s changing established industries, but its wallet share remains relatively small in many areas, in part because it hasn\u2019t fully cracked the nut of customer trust.    Consider, for example the findings of a 2018 Fannie Mae survey : While just 4% of people trust payment services providers most with their money and only 3% trust big tech companies, 69% trust banks. This is remarkable, in part because only 28% of millennials agree that they can trust banks to be fair and honest.     How can we interpret these apparently contradictory numbers? While Americans may distrust individual banks and bankers, they seem to have faith that the banking system as a whole is strong and will adequately protect their money.    The takeaway for fintechs is that while delivering the best solution does matter, it\u2019s important not to underestimate the importance of earning and keeping customer trust. This might mean finding a balance between setting ambitious, aggressive, growth-focused goals and aiming to maintain the basics like stability and consistency.    Robinhood floundered only this last year when it announced a high-interest checking account , only to have to rescind the offer a few days later when it became apparent that the company lacked the necessary regulatory backing to make that offering viable.    Experience matters.    We\u2019re living in the age of customer experience. Three-quarters of customers expect companies to understand their needs and expectations, and three-quarters of banks rank customer experience as a higher strategic priority than sales origination, cost cutting and compliance.    But when it comes to fintech, there\u2019s more to creating a great customer experience than developing the best tech. This is most easily illustrated in the banking space: 28% of banking customers are digital only \u2014 and they\u2019re the least satisfied customer group.    This is likely because of what I like to call the clean window problem: When your window is clean (i.e., functioning as it should), you don\u2019t notice it at all. You focus on whatever is outside it. Similarly, when tech works well \u2014 even innovative tech \u2014 customers don\u2019t notice it. They simply do what they need to do. When it\u2019s buggy, though, everyone notices and quickly grows frustrated.     Technology can make people\u2019s lives easier, but it\u2019s not likely to inspire emotional feelings of gratitude, connection or wellness in the way that human interactions can.    The takeaway for fintech startups? When focusing on customer experience, broaden your definition to include more than the digital, in-app or online experience. Every interaction customers have with your brand \u2014 and the service it delivers or enables \u2014 is part of their experience.     As you seek to improve that experience, remember that it includes every time your solution falls short, every time a customer has a question your site doesn\u2019t answer and every time they just want to talk to a person.    Changing the \u2018how\u2019 of finances doesn\u2019t change the \u2018what.\u2019    Technology continues to make financial transactions \u2014 from buying insurance and making claims to investing, saving, transferring money and more \u2014 easier and more convenient. But changing the \u201chow\u201d doesn\u2019t alter the \u201cwhat,\u201d which is that money matters are deeply personal.     To deliver solutions customers feel comfortable with and confident in, fintech startups need to be sure they focus on developing real, person-to-person relationships with their customers throughout the customer experience.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42694905107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-JBW1-F07F-83JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"937\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000D75A</classCode><className>GENERATION Z</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001313</classCode><className>PERSONAL FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N522292GC</classCode><className>MORTGAGE BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001168</classCode><className>MORTGAGE LOANS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

You're not just looking after your customer and employee information but also yours. If your digital assets[3] get compromised, you won't be able to resume your business. [REITs] Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[4] Despite these risks, many companies haven't exactly caught up. New customers come to their digital kingdom everyday but little thought is placed on the parameters placed to protect their assets. If you haven't caught on the importance of trust and identity security[5], here are seven reasons why you should:1. Cyber Attacks Are More Common Than You ThinkNowadays, you don't need human hackers to attack your system. They can do it with the help of automated bots. This can result in you losing important files, software systems, and even intellectual property[6]. It's quite a scary thought and should prompt you to take IT security even more seriously.2. It's Never Safe EnoughMany companies pride themselves in their ability to handle cyber threats. However, one can never be too safe. It's reported[7] that most cyber attacks are simply a result of a successful phishing attempt. Don't settle for secure enough. Think of the worst case scenario and make a plan of action around that scenario.3. A Data Breach Can Cost MillionsAccording to a study[8] conducted by Ponemon Institute LLC, a data breach can cost an average of $3.86 million. That's only if you're a huge organization. If you have a close-knit community of loyal customers, you can estimate the loss for each one to be $148. It doesn't sound like much but one customer lost means money[9] lost.4. Customer Trust MattersYour customer's trust is more important than anything. They not only trust that you'll provide them quality products and services, they also expect you to keep their data private. A data breach could mean losing hundreds, if not thousands of customers.5. Company Reputation Matters So MuchEvery company thrives on a good reputation. It no doubt brings in more money to your business. However, a poor reputation due to lack of security[10] can turn customers away and maybe even kill your business for good.6. Better Customer UnderstandingHaving a track record of keeping information secure means your customers trust you more. They're more loyal to you and likely to divulge more information about themselves if it means you're able to deliver a more tailored service to them.7. Data Breach Fines Are Getting More ExpensiveYou not only lose customers and a lot of time in the process, you also lose the trust of federal regulators whose job is to protect people's information[11] online. These are institutions you have to pay a fine because you didn't take your security seriously enough. Fines for a data breach can cost as much as $50,000 per violation. The fines are only expected to increase in the coming years. What's worse is that these organizations will have the ability to stop your business from operating if you incur too many violations.In ConclusionWhen it comes to digital trust, you need to think like your customer[12]. How secure would your information has to be for you to feel at ease? What kind of consequences would there be if this kind of information got leaked to the public? How would you feel if that happened to you? You want to make sure your business is taking all the right measures to address these risks.

According to the Speer/Asselin/Mendes report, \"The Chinese government has been ahead of the United States in particular and Western countries in general in terms of implementing a deliberate industrial strategy in order to develop comparative advantages in the intangibles economy. It has worked.\"</p><p>China's rise, they say, is due to the Communist Party's adoption of a state-driven \"alternative to democratic capitalism.\" China's rise is allegedly due to its ability to use state planning to dominate the new global paradigm that's taking shape around the \"intangibles economy.\"</p><p>No space here to get into the nature of the intangibles economy, except to say that apparently the world is shifting away from a tangible goods-producing model and toward a new technology-driven model in which corporations produce thoughts and software and data rather than things. As a result, corporations today tend to be valued more on the basis of their technology than their investment in plant and equipment.</p><p>But even if one accepts that the market economy has fostered a transition to more intangibles and fewer tangibles, it does not necessarily follow that a new Chinese Communist-style national economic strategy is needed. Which may explain why the Speer/Asselin/Mendes paper depends heavily on references to a long line of anti-free-market economic thinkers to support their conclusions.</p><p>First they go after the free-market policies of the past 40 years, dropping the names of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher (the Reagan-Thatcher \"ethos\"). They dismiss the 1985 Canadian Royal Commission on economic growth headed by former Liberal finance minister Donald Macdonald as a piece of antiquarian economic thought. The Macdonald commission supported privatizations, free markets and free trade. Canada thrived. But while the Macdonald plan \"served Canada well\" for three decades, say Speer et al., 2020 is a different time that requires dismissing all that neo-liberal Milton Friedmanism.</p><p>Throughout the Speer/Asselin/Mendes paper lie references to a slew of anti-globalization books, commentaries and assessments that are part of the burbling leftist anti-capitalism that is sweeping the academic and media world. Cited authorities include The Entrepreneurial State by Mariana Mazzucato and (indirectly) The Corruption of Capitalism by Guy Standing, which portrays Goldman Sachs, Uber and just about any owner of assets as part of a \"rentier capitalism\" that oppresses workers. Standing's work has been championed by Martin Wolf at the Financial Times, which has recently become a bastion of anti-capitalism.</p><p>It turns out that the basis for much of the Speer/Asselin/Mendes paper has at least one foot dangling in the neo-Marxist side of the great ideological divide over the role of government in the economy - inequality is growing, the rich are getting richer, and the financial/big-tech economy is rigged.</p><p>To overcome all this alleged failure of free market, free trade and globalization policies (and despite the massive 40 years achievement of such policies) Speer et al. provide a sketchy outline of how their new \"challenge-driven industrial strategy\" would function in practice.</p><p>First we need some typical consultancy advocacy gobbledygook to get the strategy ball rolling. \"An industrial strategy would focus on a mix of policies, including financing research and development, taxation, innovation, intellectual property, procurement, regulatory and human capital, to build comparative advantages in key parts of global supply chains. It is about creating a coherent strategy to build domestic productive capacity in the new sources of wealth, opportunity, and in turn strategic relevance in the new geoeconomic environment.\"</p><p>Got that? As to which key sectors to target, the Speer/Asselin/Mendes paper provides few suggestions. It rejects the idea of \"picking winners\" and instead proposes that state planners dedicate themselves to spurring \"domestic technologies and commercial applications\" in three key areas: climate change, smart cities and an aging population, with maybe some military work to create a kind of U.S.-style military-industrial complex.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic story has been patched into the paper, including via two footnote references to a Foreign Policy magazine survey of experts who are said to agree that the pandemic \"will change the world forever,\" therefore supporting the need for a new industrial strategy.</p><p>One of those foreign policy thinkers, however, is Stephen M. Walt at Harvard University. He said the pandemic will cause a further retreat from globalization and increase the power of national governments.

The team's work led to Binance updating their ERC20 libraries through OpenZeppelin and removing other miscellaneous 'low risk issues.' A Dual Issue Digital Sterling Binance, nimble navigators of global regulatory arbitrage, are pushing ahead on the stablecoin[3] against the almost poetic backdrop of Facebook blockchain head David Marcus having faced calls for a Libra development moratorium in U.S. congressional oversight hearings this week.Of course, BGBP will simply be pegged 1:1 with the pound, whereas Libra is being more ambitiously devised like a Big Tech-backed non-sovereign central bank currency. </p><p>(Note: Binance has considered attempting to join the Libra Association[4], per company chief strategy officer Gin Chao).The BGBP won't be too simple though, as the token is set to be released both on Ethereum and the exchange's in-house blockchcain, Binance Chain, Binance chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao said on the news:'The Quantstamp team is thorough and efficient when it comes to ensuring the security of ERC20 tokens, and we are appreciative of their audit of our first stablecoin, BGBP. As a dual issue token, BGBP is created on both Ethereum as an ERC20 token and on Binance Chain as a BEP2 token. We will eventually enable the two versions of BGBP to be converted freely and traded on Binance Jersey and Binance DEX.'The stablecoin comes after CEO Zhao confirmed during a YouTube 'Ask Me Anything' back in May that the exchange was exploring launching its own stablecoins. The Cryptoeconomy's Auditors of Choice Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma hailed the BGBP audit as just the latest sign of the startup's rising prominence in the cryptoeconomy:'At Quantstamp, we are building the standard for blockchain security. Companies approach us because we help them innovate securely.'In recent months, the fledgling play has made a name for itself in reviewing the smart contracts of high-profile industry stakeholders like eToro and Prysmatic Labs, and in doing so has 'secured over a billion dollars of digital asset value,' the company has said.In June, the startup launched the Quantstamp Security Network V2 on the Ethereum mainnet. With the activation, users can leverage the network scan and store smart contract vulnerability reports on the Ethereum blockchain. The update also made it possible for community members to run a Quantstamp node to earn the network's native token, QSP. Binance Has One Speed: Grind The Malta-based exchange is taking a blitzkrieg approach to asserting itself as the cryptoeconomy's leading service provider.This month alone, Binance has burned $24 million[5] worth of its BNB tokens, opened up a margin trading platform[6], announced plans for a cryptocurrency futures service, and turned two years old.On the margin trading launch, CEO Zhao noted the company was gunning to become the most useful exchange brand for cryptocurrency users of all stripes:'This is another step in providing an inclusive cryptocurrency trading platform catering to the needs of both advanced institutional traders and retail traders under the same roof. We are providing a new tool in the financial services and cryptocurrency markets to help amplify trading results of successful trades.'Notably, the exchange also recently confirmed that it was looking to open up a new America-based operation, Binance US[7]. <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton\">https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro\">https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro</url> eToro Risk Warning: 66% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

Concern about a major data breach involving social media users prompted similar parliamentary committee studies in both Canada and the United Kingdom. Information exchanged between the two committees and their willingness to work together paved the way for the inception of an International Grand Committee (IGC)--a series of meetings held by existing national-level parliamentary committees where parliamentarians from other countries are invited to participate. In this article, the authors outline the process to create the IGC, summarize two IGC meetings, and present comments on the IGC's work by three Canadian parliamentarians who participated in these meetings. They conclude by noting the IGC meetings enabled parliamentarians from various countries to work together on issues of shared concern and importance, using existing national parliamentary committees as hosts and conduits for these international meetings; this structure differs from the work of multilateral interparliamentary assemblies.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>On March 17, 2018, The Guardian and the New York Times reported a data breach involving Cambridge Analytica, a company founded in the United Kingdom (U.K.), and Facebook. (1)</p><p>With the help of Christopher Wylie, a Canadian whistleblower who was a former employee of Cambridge Analytica, the papers revealed that the company had scraped the data of over 50 million Facebook users. The personal information collected had been used in various campaigns, including the 2016 presidential elections in the United States and the referendum on the U.K.'s exit from the European Union (a process nicknamed \"Brexit\"). (2)</p><p>Responding to this situation, Canada's House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics (the Canadian Committee) adopted a motion on March 22, 2018, to study \"the privacy implications of platform monopolies and possible national and international regulatory and legislative remedies to assure the privacy of citizens' data and the integrity of democratic and electoral processes across the globe.\" (3)</p><p>Later reporting revealed that the number of Facebook profiles acquired by Cambridge Analytica was closer to 87 million and may have included the profiles of approximately 600,000 Canadians. (4)</p><p>When the data breach was reported in March 2018, the U.K. House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee (the DCMS Committee) was already conducting an inquiry on disinformation and \"fake news.\" (5) News of the breach led the DCMS Committee to focus part of its inquiry on Cambridge Analytica and other parties involved in that scandal.</p><p>The similarities between the Canadian and U.K. parliamentary studies, in addition to the fact that the whistleblower at the origin of the scandal was Canadian and that a Canadian company AggregatelQ --was also involved, convinced the two committees to collaborate. (6) Damian Collins, the Chair of the DCMS Committee, appeared before the Canadian Committee in April 2018 and both committees exchanged information regarding their respective work. (7)</p><p>The unprecedented collaboration between the U.K. and Canadian parliamentary committees and their will to collaborate at an international level in a parliamentary setting led to the inception of an \"International Grand Committee\" (IGC).</p><p>The term \"grand committee\" is not novel in the U.K. Parliament. It is the name attributed to an existing forum. Current grand committees in that country include the Welsh Grand Committee, the Scottish Grand Committee, the Northern Ireland Grand Committee, the Grand Committees: House of Lords and the Regional Grand Committees. (8) The purpose of a grand committee is to allow U.K. members of Parliament \"to debate issues affecting their region.\" (9) In a similar fashion, the purpose of the IGC was to allow parliamentarians from various countries to debate common issues affecting their respective jurisdictions.</p><p>The first meeting of the IGC was held in London, U.K., in November 2018. Despite its name, the IGC is not a stand-alone entity. It represents, in fact, a series of meetings held by existing national-level parliamentary committees where parliamentarians from other countries are invited to participate.</p><p>In London, the IGC was hosted by the DCMS Committee and occurred in the context of its inquiry on disinformation and \"fake news.\" The meeting was therefore named \"IGC on Disinformation and 'Fake News'.\" As host, the DCMS Committee invited Canada and seven other countries from Asia, South America and Europe to participate.</p><p>After the success of the first IGC meeting in London, the participating parliamentarians agreed that there should be another meeting in a different country. The second IGC meeting was hosted by the Canadian Committee in May 2019, in Ottawa, and called the \"IGC on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy.\"</p><p>That three-day meeting culminated in the \"Ottawa Declaration,\" a joint statement signed by the participating parliamentarians on May 28, 2019. The signatories resolved to continue the work of the IGC in order to \"foster market competition, increase the accountability of social media platforms, protect privacy rights and personal data, and maintain and strengthen democracy.\" (10)</p><p>At the end of the meeting, Ireland was mentioned as a possible host for the next edition of the IGC, which should be held in November 2019. (11)</p><p>The shared concern over international issues surrounding data protection, privacy and data monopolies has allowed parliamentary committees to bring more attention to these issues and to work cooperatively to identify possible solutions.</p><p>Meeting of the International Grand Committee in the United Kingdom</p><p>Held on November 27, 2018, the inaugural IGC meeting included parliamentarians from Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Ireland, Latvia, Singapore and the U.K.</p><p>Parliamentarians from other countries were formally listed as witnesses to allow them to participate in a meeting of a U.K. House of Commons committee. In practice, however, the foreign parliamentarians were co-opted members of the DCMS Committee and invited to sit at the table with the regular members of that committee and ask questions to the witnesses. Foreign parliamentarians did not, however, have voting rights or any other rights of a formal member of the DCMS Committee.</p><p>Topics discussed at the London IGC included the disinformation and \"fake news\" inquiry of the DCMS Committee, the Cambridge Analytica data breach and its links to Brexit, Facebook's business practices and its complicity in the spreading of disinformation, and the non-attendance of Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, as well as the U.K. Information Commissioner's investigation into the use of data ytics in politics.</p><p>Finally, as part of their participation in the IGC meeting in London, parliamentarians signed a document entitled International Principles on the Regulation of Tech Platforms. (12)</p><p>The final report of the DCMS Committee on its disinformation and \"fake news\" inquiry was published in February 2019. (13)</p><p>Meeting of the International Grand Committee in Canada</p><p>The Canadian Committee and--by extension--the IGC on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy, held an IGC meeting in Ottawa on May 27-29, 2019. In addition to Canadian members of Parliament, IGC participants included parliamentarians from 10 other countries, namely Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Morocco, Singapore, St. Lucia and the U.K.</p><p>Foreign parliamentarians participating in the IGC in Canada were presented as witnesses under the title \"Members of Other Parliaments.\" The Canadian Committee agreed to a formula that diverged from its usual practice when hearing witnesses to allow the members of other parliaments participating in the proceedings a greater opportunity to participate in the activities of the committee and to ask questions of other witnesses.</p><p>During the IGC meeting, witnesses included experts and academics, as well as regulators. The IGC also heard from representatives of the following technology companies: Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Mozilla. Mark Zuckerberg was formally invited to appear but declined to do so.</p><p>On June 18, 2019, Canadian Committee Chair Bob Zimmer presented a report in the House of Commons on the IGC hearings held in Canada, which invited future members of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics in the 43rd Parliament to continue pursuing the issues raised during the meeting and to continue the work of the IGC in collaboration with parliamentarians from other countries. (14)</p><p>The International Grand Committee from the Point of View of Canadian Parliamentarians</p><p>Canadian parliamentarians who participated in both the U.K. and Canadian meetings of the IGC are the Chair of the Canadian Committee, Bob Zimmer, as well as the Vice-Chairs, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and Charlie Angus. In this final part of the article, we share their perspective on the work accomplished by the IGC.</p><p>First, Mr. Zimmer explains the importance of participating in the International Grand Committee meetings and how he hopes the work of the IGC will continue in the next Parliament. Second, Mr. Erskine-Smith underlines two reasons why the work of the International Grand Committee has been important. Finally, Mr. Angus emphasizes the need for international cooperation which was reflected in the work of the IGC and his hopes for the future of citizens rights in the digital world.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The IGC meetings held in the U.K. and Canada enabled parliamentarians from various countries to work together on issues of shared concern and importance, using existing national parliamentary committees as hosts and conduits for these international meetings. This differs from such efforts at multilateral interparliamentary assemblies. So far, as Mr. Zimmer, Mr. Erskine-Smith and Mr. Angus have highlighted in sharing their thoughts on the meetings, the IGC has shown that national parliamentary committees have the capacity to demonstrate leadership on current issues and to engage publicly and effectively with their counterparts abroad.</p><p>\"When news broke of the personal data breach involving Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics took it upon ourselves to try to find answers for the over 600,000 Canadians that were affected.</p><p>The study grew into something much bigger than any of us had expected as we began to learn more about the amount of personal data digital platforms are able to collect--often without the users' knowledge or consent--and this added a sense of urgency and relevance to what we were studying.</p><p>It also became clear that many of our international colleagues were also trying to find the same answers on behalf of their citizens and that many of the issues we all were grappling with were global in nature. This gave us the unique opportunity to work collaboratively with our international colleagues to try to find ways to protect the privacy of our citizens.</p><p>It was an honour to co-chair both the inaugural meeting of the International Grand Committee in London and the second meeting in Ottawa. Both meetings allowed us to hear from a variety of expert witnesses, from regulators, and from the platforms themselves. Each participating country also brought to the proceedings their own distinct experiences and questions.</p><p>These are important conversations that we must continue to have as we seek to find answers to the questions we have on behalf of those we represent. For me personally, my biggest concerns are for our citizens' privacy, our democracy, and that our rights to freedom of speech are maintained according to our Constitution.</p><p>\"As lawmakers, we are all examining ways to protect our citizens from threats to our democracies in the digital age. That is why it is important that we continue to come together as a group to share our knowledge and best practices for tackling these global issues.</p><p>It is clear that the work that we have been pursuing with regards to data privacy is far from over and I would urge the members that will form the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics in the next Parliament to continue to examine these issues and the collaborative work of the International Grand Committee.\"</p><p>Bob Zimmer, M.P., Chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics</p><p>\"In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there's been a growing realization that stronger rules are needed to better protect our privacy, defend our democracies from interference, and hold big tech companies to account. The International Grand Committee has been important for two principal reasons.</p><p>\"First, the collaboration across jurisdictions has helped to raise public awareness of these issues in a way that no single parliamentary committee would have been able to do. The collective effort has elevated the conversation in the media and with the public, and both companies and governments are now taking these issues more seriously than they were before.</p><p>\"Second, global problems require global solutions. Data very easily moves across borders, and few jurisdictions have the standing to move unilaterally with great success. Co-operation among lawmakers from around the world is crucial to developing and implementing solutions, and through the IGC we've established a framework for continued co-operation.\"</p><p>Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, M.P., Vice-Chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics</p><p>\"Legislators across the world are grappling with the enormous power of transnational platforms and the corporations that run them. The refusal of Mark Zuckerberg to respond to political demands for accountability demonstrate why there must be international cooperation.</p><p>The work of the International Grand Committee is an unprecedented coming together of international legislators. It allowed us to put on the record serious questions about the growing power of surveillance capitalism. It is helping provide various jurisdictions around the world with a road map for protecting privacy, competition, democracy and labour rights.</p><p>It is my hope that this is the beginning of a lasting movement to restore the rights of the citizen in the digital realm.\"</p><p>Charlie Angus, M.P., Vice-Chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics</p><p>Alexandra Savoie and Maxime-Olivier Thibodeau are ysts with the Library of Parliament.</p><p>Notes</p><p>(1) M.

I am not one to comment on political matters. I have, however, written before of the regulatory challenges that Big Tech companies will start to face all over the world. Goyal is not alone in expressing frustration with what many governments see as the predatory practices of Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In September 2019, Bloomberg (bloom.bg/38WoVfI) reported that a team of investigators from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has started interviewing small businesses that sell products on Amazon.com Inc. to determine whether the e-commerce giant is using its market power to hurt competition. Other Big Tech companies are also being investigated. Both Google and Facebook are under scrutiny by the FTC as well as by other US state and federal agencies for alleged antitrust practices.</p><p>An obvious question is whether Amazon has an unfair advantage over third-party sellers who use its platform to sell products that compete with the resellers' offerings. More than 90% of the revenue of many sellers, especially in the US, comes from Amazon. This gives Amazon tremendous market power. News reports also allege that after shutting off a merchant, Amazon can hold on to their money and inventory for more than 90 days.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic hopeful against President Donald Trump for the US presidential election later this year, has made public her plans to break up Big Tech. Most of her focus is on Amazon, Google and Facebook, which according to her \"run the internet\", but special attention is being paid to marketplaces that sell their own goods on the platforms they control. If her plans come to fruition, it would mean that the Amazon Basics brand will disappear from the US website. Her proposals will also affect some of Amazon's other businesses, such as its Alexa hardware and its grocery business, but the most obvious impact will be on its own-label goods. In 2018, The New York Times conducted an analysis that determined that Amazon uses the data it gets from third-party sellers to help determine what actually sells, it provides advantageous placement or online \"real estate\" for its own products over those of its competitors. Sellers are dependent on the marketplace, so they cannot take their services elsewhere, and its status as a megacorp gives it the market power to sell products at lower prices than its rivals.</p><p>The upshot of Warren bringing this debate to the fore means that all other Democratic contenders will now have to formulate a set of policy promises on how to regulate Big Tech and, as a result, this will be a big election issue.</p><p>The EU has, meanwhile, started a formal probe to see if Amazon uses data from independent retailers who sell on the company's marketplace to its own advantage. The investigation centres on Amazon's dual role as both a retailer and a marketplace.</p><p>Last year, the Competition Commission of India dismissed a case brought by the All India Online Vendors Association against Flipkart (now owned by Walmart Inc.), Amazon's arch-rival in India's e-commerce space. India does not yet have a comprehensive set of e-commerce laws, though it has drafted a new policy on foreign direct investment (FDI) in marketplace platforms. The salient parts of the policy do not allow foreign-owned companies to exercise control over inventory or own retailers on their platform. In addition, if a vendor sells more than 25% of all its goods on such a platform, it bumps them into a new category as an inventory-based business, a sector that is barred to FDI. To add teeth to these FDI restrictions, the warranty of goods and services sold on marketplaces is the responsibility of the seller or vendor, and not the marketplace platform.</p><p>This unfortunately allows e-commerce sites to dodge responsibility for counterfeit products sold on their platforms. However, in the US, Amazon routinely classifies itself as a retailer, which allows it to calculate its market share of the entire country's retail space as being in single digits. This works to its advantage when arguments are made about market power. Interestingly, however, this classification has now made it vulnerable to action in the US that makes it responsible for counterfeit goods sold through its platform. Evidently, Trump has just set in motion a slew of anti-counterfeit regulations. These were based on a report (bit.ly/3bfJ1DQ) filed by the US Department of Homeland Security, which is also responsible for customs checks on imported goods. According to it, the global sales volume of counterfeits is growing at 15% each year, and the report estimates that sales of counterfeits will reach $1.82 billion in value by the end of this year. Trump's regulations will have the effect of putting Amazon on the hook for monitoring and policing counterfeits available on its platform, which is not the case in India.</p><p>It seems as if uniformity the world over on government policies might be needed to counter the growth of the uglier aspects of Big Tech.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MintAsia.

Its progenitor: technology. The innovations that kickstarted the Industrial Revolution fostered modern democracy and led to the foundation of modern economies. They disrupted society, upending old structures, as well as building new ones. Institutions, industry and demography were all to change course and, ultimately, little about life in Britain was left untouched by the Revolution. As it spreadfirst to Western Europe and the United Statesit also left a much wider mark on the world. Technological transformation took a long time to feed through to politics and policy. But its diffusion ended up permeating both, ultimately reshaping political parties before the founding of the Labour Party, representing the culmination of a long debate over the role of capital and rights of workers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, as the world undergoes a profound period of technological change, far beyond what was experienced during the Industrial Revolution, there are some rhymes of history. There are deep questions around inequality, productivity and regulatory capture. Worries around corporatism are rising and consequently, calls for socialism are becoming louder. But the potential for reordering is even more substantial than in the past. It has also already begun.</p><p>The companies that have dominated this age to date have done so as result of significant economies of scale and strong network effects. New business models have evolved, with platforms, aggregators and infrastructure businesses blowing away old models that controlled distribution and had costly fixed assets. This has in turn brought many people closer to economy: the restless inventiveness of a place like Silicon Valley was born out of public funding, but it thrived because the internet enabled distributed entrepreneurship and decentralised power. The countries that are thriving are those that innovative, adopt and adapt. Take-up begets take-off.</p><p>The innovation engine is also no longer the national economy in the way that it was during the Industrial Revolution. Every country can be open to outside developments, and whereas in the eighteenth century the UK was an early exporter of new knowledge, many of the most significant developments today are happening in the US, China and other leading nations of Europe. This has raised the potential of what is possible, but so too has it changed people's perceptions.</p><p>We live in an age of abundance, but in an abstract sense. The resources are not of the earth. Their application is often unforeseeable, while the unintended consequences of connecting billions of people can be chaotic. But, like some of the great reform legislation of the nineteenth century, new media have enfranchised many more people. The overall effect of such change can feel like a cacophony in which it is hard to discern the signal from the noise. Politics and journalism, once the gatekeepers and leaders of public debate, have had their power eroded and are scrambling to hold onto control by lowering their standards.</p><p>It is a hyper-documented time, and in a far more diverse and open public sphere some of the potential effects that technology might have on public policy are being widely explored. For example, the nature of work is changing, as a result of new business models and labour-replacing technologies that raise the spectre of large-scale worker displacement. This raises questions about education and retraining, welfare and human purpose. What are the skills needed for workers to withstand technological shocks? What is the right balance between labour and capital, when over-incentivising technology might hurt productivity by under-developing the human capital necessary to complement it? And should the OECD consensus on taxing labour more heavily than capital change?</p><p>The growing clamour to tackle climate change has also opened up debates around the sustainability of capitalism. The question is whether a new model is needed, or whether technological changebased on its existing trendscan result in the necessary dematerialisation. This debate has its genesis in the Industrial Revolution and the resource use that was required to build modern, capitalist economies. But there is a compelling argument that Western nations are using technology to liberate the environment and are increasingly conscious of the need to produce and consume more wisely. Key to this has been the growth in renewable energy, with some forecasts predicting that zero-carbon technologies will overtake fossil fuels and provide more than half of the world's generation needs by 2030. But the focus on this issue needs to be relentless, with investment in technological innovation and efficiency at the heart of it. In technological terms, this is the earthshot goal that politics must pursue.</p><p>Underpinning this, however, will be artificial intelligence. It has the potential to radically alter the frontiers of our current reality. More than 40 nations have now published strategies outlining its potential across the whole public sphere: our models of health, education and even institutions themselves will all look dramatically different within a generation. But there is an existential question about what superhuman intelligence might bring, and whether such systems' objectives would align with ours. This poses a fundamental line of inquiry: rather than continuing our current course, should we be ensuring that any actions that machines take are to achieve human objectives, rather than the loose objectives they presently pursue?</p><p>With such deep issues to contend with, the overarching similarity between now and the Industrial Revolution is that there will almost certainly be a great realignment. The last few years of Western politics have in large part been a signal of this. The cultural and economic factors that have driven some of the upheaval of the old order have their origins in technology. Communication has been revolutionised and democratised. It has revealed pockets of hate, but it has also created new productive networks and access to insights and knowledge that were previously unimaginable.

There are some clear challenges, but technology is primarily driven by people. Politics' role is not to fight it, but instead to guide it towards optimal societal outcomes.</p><p>First wave of gadgets</p><p>First wave of gadgets</p><p>\"About 1760 a wave of gadgets swept over England\"2Ashton, T. S., The industrial revolution, 1760-1830. [1997 ed.] Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press was the description of events that century by a schoolboy in T.S. Ashton's The Industrial Revolution. His choice of words may conjure up images of small devices or even novelties, but the \"gadgets\" of the eighteenth century were more monumental: Abraham Darby's coke blast furnaces in 1710; Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine in 1712; James Watts' steam engine in 1776; John Kay's fly-shuttle in 1773; Hargreaves' spinning jenny in 1770; and Richard Arkwright's water frame a year later. That era of human history was characterised by famous inventions that together changed the course of the next two centuries.</p><p>The impact of these innovations, however, was not purely economic. The direction of public policy would change, as would the distribution of political power. The foundational text of capitalism was written, as was that of communism. New parties rose. Trade unions were formed. Protectionism made way for liberalisation. In short, feats of engineering re-engineered society. But it took a long time for politics to catch up with the reality of these advances. As we experience another revolution today, more gadgets have swept over us. The mobile phone is arguably the world's first universal technology. Objects such as headphones and televisions are ubiquitous, while some other digital elements are more abstract, living in the ether of the internet. The scale and scope of these are more substantive, and the opportunities more profound. But there are again questions about diffusion and how politics adapts. Yet as with the Industrial Revolution, many politicians are failing to adapt to the changes around them, attempting to impose control, and faltering in helping people through an accelerating process of change.</p><p>The origins and causes of England's Industrial Revolution are the subject of significant debate by economists and historians alike. Various explanations have been put forward, some mono- and others multi-causal. High wages along with cheap coal created demand for technology, as industry sought to substitute labour for capital and energy. The rate of capital formation increased, as did levels of world trade. Institutional shocks3Acemoglu, D, S Johnson, and J A Robinson (2005), \"The Rise of Europe: Atlantic Trade, Institutional Change and Economic Growth\", American Economic Review 95: 546-579. such as the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and earlier, the Civil Wars, created a more inclusive, pluralistic political culture, with the establishment of the supremacy of Parliament over the monarchy and the basis of the Whig party. The Reformation had earlier laid the basis for the \"Protestant work ethic\". Geographical factors, such as a temperate climate and an abundance of resources, also conferred advantages over the tropics and nations with scarce natural wealth, while the dissolution of monasteries4Leander Heldring, James Robinson, Sebastian Vollmer, \"The origins of the Industrial Revolution\", VoxEU.org, 18 November 2017 <url normalizedValue=\"https://voxeu.org/article/origins-industrial-revolution\">https://voxeu.org/article/origins-industrial-revolution</url> 200 years before and the creation of land markets drove local industrialisation.</p><p>Evolutionist arguments have also been offered as alternatives to revolution. These present a collectivist view of endeavour, in which dynamism only flourishes within an ecosystem, and where humans tend to converge on ideas at a given time. Thus the Industrial Revolution can be seen as the compound effect of the \"altruistic individualism of Renaissance humanism, the vitalism of the Baroque, and the modernism of the Enlightenment\"5Phelps, Edmund, \"Mass Flourishing: How Grassroots Innovation Created Jobs, Challenge, and Change,\" Princeton University Press, 2013. JSTOR, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bbrz\">www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bbrz</url>, . This view, in which a confluence of social and economic factors and variables aligned, was why England just pipped France and Belgium to the line. From all of this, what is clear is that industrialisation was a complex historical process that combined economic, social, cultural and scientific forces. And as the economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke and Jeffrey G. Williamson write, even if scholars cannot agree on the date or even the terminology, one thing is indisputable: \"the rate of technological advance accelerated\"6O'rourke, K.H. and Williamson, J.G. J Econ Growth (2005)       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10887-005-1111-5\">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10887-005-1111-5</url>\"&gt; . The nation was about to take off and become the workshop of the world.</p><p>This technological progress was to underpin the country's transition to modern economic growth. Productivity growth led to an increase in GDP per capita, as well as real wages. It dispelled the famous theory of the economist Thomas Malthus, who wrote that the \"power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man\"7Malthus, Thomas, An Essay on the Principle of Population, 1798, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf\">http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf</url> , although at the time, the strength of the former was significant. In 1750, the population of England and Wales was little more than 6 million. But by the time Malthus published his Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798, towns and cities had begun to swell. This growth and the worries of catastrophe that it had unlocked raised political questions. John Rickman, a civil servant, described the problem in a technocratic sentence for the ages: \"an intimate knowledge of any country can be the only foundation of the legislation of that country.\"8Levitan K, \"A National Undertaking\": Taking the Census. In: A Cultural History of the British Census. Palgrave Studies in Cultural and Intellectual History. Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2011      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230337602_2#citeas\">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230337602_2#citeas</url> Charles Abbot, a Member of Parliament who was about to become Speaker of the House of Commons, agreed, as did the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, and in 1800 Parliament accordingly passed the Population Act, legislating for the United Kingdom's first census to be conducted a year later. By this time, the population was approaching 11 million. Urban centres such as London and Manchester had seen their populations rise dramatically.</p><p>The pessimism or even myopia of Malthus, who failed to account for technological change increasing agricultural yields, was understandable in an early era of deep technological change. But it is also an argument that has continued to play out in different guises in the centuries since. On each occasion, the pessimists have usually been proved wrong, even if they have often provided a useful challenge function. Today, the productivity puzzle is one that continues to pose questions for economists, even if it is now 30 years on from Robert Solow's quip that \"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\"9Solow, Robert, \"We'd better watch out\", New York Times Book Review, 12 July 1987 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.standupeconomist.com/pdf/misc/solow-computer-productivity.pdf\">http://www.standupeconomist.com/pdf/misc/solow-computer-productivity.pdf</url> For example, the American economist Robert Gordon has argued that we may never see the growth of days gone past, and that all the big breakthroughs have essentially been achieved. Others have gone further, writing about the death of science, or suggested that perceived failings of the Large Hadron Collider, for example, show that we are approaching the limits of our knowledge.</p><p>As a rejoinder, some have argued that the growth of previous centuries is not necessary: for example, in Why Slower Economic Growth Is a Sign of Success, Dietrich Vollrath has written that in \"1940 you might have spent your money installing plumbing for running water, or a toilet\"10Vollrath, Dietrich, \"Why Slower Economic Growth Is a Sign of Success,\" forthcoming, January 2020, University of Chicago Press,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo44520849.html\">https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo44520849.html</url> , yet once we had those goods, our \"spending turned towards services\", such as Netflix and Hulu. As a result, we may need different metrics of progress. Another counter-argument to doubts about our technological potential is that artificial intelligence and other nascent technologies may change the boundaries in ways in which we can't conceive, ushering in a new golden age. It brings to mind Amara's Law named after the Stanford University computer scientist Roy Amara that we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. The charge is often that this is overly optimistic, but if drug discovery or genomics research were to solve a disease such as cancer, the cost savings to society would be huge and the human benefits cannot, of course, be quantified. But this is where diagnosis and understanding are again key.</p><p>Whether such technological breakthroughs would dramatically alter productivity is a question yet to be resolved. If we were to build a new symbiotic relationship with machines, through which humans could achieve new health or education objectives, there is a great likelihood that it would do. When Malthus wrote his Essay, there was little by way of statistical depth to challenge his thesis; butas we now knowthis was an era in which productivity was growing. In The Technology Trap, Carl Benedikt Frey explains that \"in the period 17801840, output per worker grew by 46 percent\", but the spoils of this were not being shared evenly: \"real weekly wages, in contrast, rose by a mere 12 percent\".11Frey, Carl Benedikt, \"The Technology Trap: Capital, Labour and Power in the Age of Automation,\" Princeton University Press. 2019.</p><p>A rising tide does not lift all boats</p><p>A rising tide does not lift all boats</p><p>The Industrial Revolution was arguably the first period to raise these tensions. In its first phase, the automation it brought was labour-replacing. It was an era of increasing output, but without broad-based wage growth, and of increasing profits for some, while many in poverty saw little improvement to their economic lot. Over decades, this can have net positive results, as the capital released can be deployed in creating new industries and better-paid and more skilled jobs. But while 20 or 30 years is not long in the sweep of human history, it can mean a whole generation of people becoming casualties. The economic historian Robert C. Allen has dubbed the first half of the nineteenth century Engels' Pause, in which the \"the surge in inequality was intrinsic to the growth process\" 12Allen, Robert C., \"Engels' Pause: Technical Change, Capital Accumulation, and Inequality in the British Industrial Revolution,\" 2008, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/Users/Allen/engelspause.pdf\">https://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/Users/Allen/engelspause.pdf</url>.</p><p>And income was not the only point to pause. Other metrics were slow to move: life expectancy in 1850 was little more than 40, much the same as it was 100 years before. A cholera outbreak in London in 1832, for example, was also to kill more than 15,000 people.</p><p>Life Expectancy in the UK</p><p>For many people, technological change resulted in work in \"dark, satanic mills\", squalid living conditions and the exploitation of children.13Nardinelli, Clark, \"Child Labor and the Industrial Revolution,\" Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1990 By 1835, 63 per cent of the textile factories' workforce consisted of children aged 812 and women. Across the country there was also a lack of franchise, little access to education or public health and no system of welfare support. Politics was taking its time to adapt to technological change that began with the establishment of the first factory in 1769 in Cromford, near Derby: it took until 1802 with the Health and Morals of Apprentices Act for any form of legislation on factories to pass. Sponsored by Sir Robert Peel father of the future Prime Minister by the same nameit stopped apprentices working at night or for more than 12 hours a day, as well as providing some basic education. Peel was a \"Church and king\" Conservative who believed in the divine right of kings and \"non-resistance\", and an ally of William Pitt the Younger, yet as a Lancashire mill owner, he showed concerns for the conditions in which children were working.</p><p>There had been previous tentative steps to address poverty: a few years earlier, the Elizabethan Poor Law, originally enacted in 1601 to provide relief for the most destitute, had been amended. To provide outdoor relief a form of assistance such as money, food or clothing without a requirement to enter a workhouse or poorhouse the Speenhamland system was established, supplementing wages to account for family size and the cost of bread. The backdrop of this reform was not purely domestic. The French Revolution at the turn of the century had fostered a deep conservatism in British politics, which was, at the time, the preserve of land-owning nobility. The Speenhamland system was a response to potential unrest that might be sparked by rising food prices.</p><p>At this time, Samuel Whitbreadan acolyte of the Whig statesman Charles James Fox and part of the \"Foxite\" progressive portion of a party divided by factionshad also put forward a bill to introduce a temporary minimum wage. This was defeated by Fox's rival, Pitt, and the then Conservative government, with Speenhamland instead attempting to provide a minimum standard of living, the basic idea of which is similar to the Universal Basic Income today. Some of the criticisms at the time also echoed those of the twenty-first-century debate. For example, the economist David Ricardo, best known for his work on the economic value of labour, worried that Speenhamland would discourage work. In Das Kapital, Karl Marx wrote that it suppressed wages, while the twentieth-century economic historian Karl Polanyi was most withering, arguing that it stopped the creation of a labour market, and that the \"labouring man was homeless in society\".14Polanyi, Karl, \"The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time,\" 1944. This is also in part because the rules in place meant people could apply for support in their parish of residence, discouraging labour mobility and migration even over short distances.</p><p>Technological backlash and attempts to assert control</p><p>Technological backlash and attempts to assert control</p><p>Even if Speenhamland played its part in staving off widespread revolution, Britain would not be immune to revolt as technology had led to hardship in part of the population. In 1811, hundreds of framework knitters gathered near Sherwood Forest, near Nottingham, to protest working conditions. This was the beginning of the Luddite uprising and a frame-breaking epidemic, which literally set man against the machine. This revolt can be seen as a form of tech-conservatism, rallying against the wheels of progress. To others it was an early form of unionism and an important example of early collective bargaining, which had been prohibited with the introduction of the Combination Act 1799 (albeit this was slightly softened a year with the Arbitration Act). A more rounded view, however, would be that technological advances were necessary, but productive techniques that produced further dislocation would need to be addressed by policy. Referencing Hobbes, Frey writes that \"the lives of many commoners got nastier, more brutish, and shorter\"15Frey, Carl Benedikt, \"The Technology Trap: Capital, Labour and Power in the Age of Automation,\" Princeton University Press. 2019. , and that for the Luddites, technology was not liberating. But government was to take the side of industry, allying political power and technological progress in a potent push for economic growth and imperial influence.</p><p>From the macro perspective, industry was essential to Britain's dominance on the world stage. It is also helped change the long-term prosperity of people around the world, expanding the resources of knowledge and technology. Just as with the transformational advance we are living through today, there was deep turbulence during the ascent of industry. Ignoring such micro elements in the short run may often be politically prudent. However, they can cause ripple effects with long-term consequences. In the Industrial Revolution the most powerful example of this was political reform, with legislation that began to shape workers' rights and welfare. But the immediate political reaction to the Luddites can in part be traced through the two pieces of legislation introduced in the aftermath: the Framework Bill, which prescribed capital punishment for breaking frames, and the Bill for the Preservation of Peace in the County of Nottingham, which allowed authorities to appoint special constables.</p><p>This was an attempt to keep a lid on an issue that was perceived as being of lower magnitude than others at the time. The Napoleonic Wars had still to be settled; and tensions with the United States were rising and would spill over into conflict that year. Trade had decayed as result, but the Conservative Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, an heir to Pitt, showed little pity towards the rioters. The Whig Lord Henry Brougham, who was later to play his part in the 1832 Reform Act and the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act, was to show more sympathy in a speech in the House of Commons. Saying that it was his duty to raise the plight of the lower classes, he described how workers in one region were \"silent, still, and desolate during half the week, during the rest of it miserably toiling at reduced wages for a pittance scarcely sufficient to maintain animal life in the lowest state of comfort.\"16<url normalizedValue=\"http://1812now.blogspot.com/2012/06/june-16-1812-orders-in-council-to-be.html\">http://1812now.blogspot.com/2012/06/june-16-1812-orders-in-council-to-be.html</url></p><p>In his maiden speech in the House of Lords, Lord Byron famously opposed the death penalty for frame-breakers, saying that while \"you may call the people a mob\", do not \"forget that a mob too often speaks the sentiments of the people\".17Frame Work Bill, HL Deb 27 February 1812 vol 21 cc964 <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1812/feb/27/frame-work-bill\">https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1812/feb/27/frame-work-bill</url> . Byron's romanticism differentiated him from Whigs such as Brougham and Whitbread, who were heavily influenced by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. The progressives of the party, their liberalism was based on individualism and rationalismon utilitarian ideals. Out of government for a long period, the Whigs remained their commitment to \"peace, retrenchment and reform\", but they were still a party of a rural society, not of the growing industrial capitalist one. Radicals such as Tom Paine were also active at this time, and believed that power and sovereignty lay with the people and not the monarchy. But the party of government at this time was the Conservatives.</p><p>Perceval and his successor, Lord Liverpool, represented the Old Tory orthodoxy, people whoalongside religion and the divine right of the monarchybelieved in limited government or interference, including in the labour market. This was perhaps in part due to an excessive interpretation of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776), just as today people misunderstand its critique of corporatism, and the need for competition in the market. Writing on this period in The Web of Government, the sociologist Robert MacIver has said that as the country transformed from an oligarchical state into a laissez-faire one, \"there is no more remarkable example in history than this of the ineptitude of political man to adapt his institutions to the needs of the times.\"18MacIver, R. M., \"The Web of Government,\" 1947, <url normalizedValue=\"https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.222117/2015.222117.The-Web_djvu.txt\">https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.222117/2015.222117.The-Web_djvu.txt</url> This is perhaps being again tested today as institutions of an analogue age try to keep up with people living in a digital one.</p><p>Among the elite and intellectuals of the nineteenth century there was also a nostalgia for the passing of the idyll of the agrarian economy and a lament for the evils of the new squalid industrialisation, comparable to some of the moral worries over Big Tech and the disruption it creates. The poet laureate, Robert Southey, summed up the sentiments of many: \"The immediate and whole effect of the manufacturing systems, carried upon as it is now on the great scale, is to produce physical and moral evil,\"19Riello, Giorgio and O'Brien, Patrick, \"Reconstructing the Industrial Revolution: analyses, perceptions and conceptions of Britain's precocious transition to Europe's first industrial society,\" Economic History Working Papers (84/04). Department of Economic History, London School of Economics and Political Science, 2004,<url normalizedValue=\"http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22337/1/WP84.pdf\">http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22337/1/WP84.pdf</url> he wrote in the Colloquies. However, there were shafts of light in political reform as a branch of Tory humanitarianism championed labour reform, and others such as Sir Samuel Romilly rallied for penal and capital punishment reform.</p><p>But as the Congress of Vienna (181415) was about to bring an end to the Napoleonic Wars and peace in Europe, another feud was about to open up at home. The rapid spread of technology around Europe had meant that other countries were producing crops more cheaply than England could. While the nation had comparative advantages in the production of iron and industrial manufacturing, the price of crops was likely to fall as a result of the end of the British naval blockade of the United States. In an attempt to protect their wealth, the country's land-owning nobility, which included the governing class, introduced the protectionist Corn Laws. New competition would be fought through mercantilism, with no imports of corn allowed until British corn reached a price of 80 shillings per quarter. From a domestic policy perspective, this legislation was going to hurt the poor the most: it would keep the price of bread high for workers, who were already beginning to show their disquiet. But it was also the wrong policy response to the changing nature of competition that technological change and more interconnected markets had brought. The Corn Laws were later to be repealed by Sir Robert Peel, in one episode of the long-running debate over free trade debate and imperial preference that consumed the Conservative Party, the echoes of which can be found in the Brexit debate today. This was the first of many feuds opened up in British politics by technology and globalisation. Politicians sought to resolve it by protecting their interests, rather than modernising to meet the people's demands.</p><p>Stifling legitimate grievances</p><p>Stifling legitimate grievances</p><p>Before Peel would be central to one of the century's most prominent debates, however, his father was seeking to build on his earlier reform. He pushed through the Cotton Mills and Factories Act in 1819, which had been originally been drafted by the reformer Robert Owen, who is known as a father of English socialism, of rationalism and, in Polanyi's words, of society itself. Owen would later establish the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union, an attempt at a general union, but for now Peel's act would prevent children under nine years old from working in the cotton industry, laying the ground for further Factory Acts. If this was a small step of progress for labour, events in Peterloo that year were about to further reshape affairs. That August, 60,000 people gathered on St Peter's Field in Manchester to protest against living conditions as well as a lack of Parliamentary representation. What was intended to be a peaceful day ended with the deaths of several hundred protestors in what has come to be known as the Peterloo massacrethe bloodiest clash in modern British political history, and one that still holds the imagination of many today.</p><p>On the 200th anniversary of the Peterloo massacre, the Labour Party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, posted on Facebook that \"a direct line runs from Peterloo to the foundation of the Labour Party, which exists to represent the interests of the majority against the elite at the top\". In the aftermath of Peterloo, the poet Percy Shelley was to write The Masque of Anarchy, one line of which\"Ye are manythey are few\"forms the basis of the party's slogan today; it was also quoted in Tony Blair's change to Clause IV of Labour's constitution in 1995 to state the belief in creating \"for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few\".</p><p>In their aggressive response at Peterloo, the authorities elevated the anger of protesters and captured the ire of many more by answering with oppression, rather than liberalisation. Still paranoid over the French Revolution, which had preoccupied Pitt, Liverpool tried to control events by suppression, introducing what became known as the Six Acts. The Whigs, who called for a Parliamentary enquiry, strongly opposed repressive legislation to prevent meetings, speed up convictions and curtail the free press. A young journalist, John Edward Taylor, was one of those present that day and the events strengthened his reformist ideas. This resulted in the founding of the Manchester Guardian two years later, a newspaper that later simply became the Guardian. That day, the historian A. J. P. Taylor has said, \"began the breakup of the old order in England\".</p><p>The role of mass movements and media is also intricately linked: in 1790, the year in which William Nicholson was to patent the cylinder press, only 1,500 people would receive a copy of The Times every day. However, innovations in printing and production as well as a reduction in \"taxes of knowledge\" would reshape the media landscape. By 1850, 40,000 would subscribe to The Times, while other papers had been established around the country and were fast in growing their readerships. The innovations of the Industrial Revolution would see papers go from single sheets, painstakingly put together at a rate of a about 200 per hour, to thousands being able to be printed. It would see knowledge, previously confined to an elite, opened up much more broadly.</p><p>However, with the Newspaper and Stamp Duties Act, Lord Liverpool had tried to stymie this. A year after Peterloo a plot to assassinate Liverpool and his Cabinet was foiled, while the consolidation of politics towards a two-party system began accelerating. More liberal Tories, such as William Huskissonwho would also be a proponent of the distinctly unenlightened position on imperial preferencepushed for reform in places, including the repeal of the Combination Acts in 1824 (although a further act introduced the following year would severely restrict the activities of unions). At this point the Conservative Party not yet a well-organised party machine. The politics of this new industrial era had so far been characterised by multiple independent groups, competing factions and attrition. The Ministry of All the Talents in 1806 had been an attempt to bring an end to political confusion, but the era was one of ideological polarisation and political conflict. Yet, since the first government of Pitt beginning in 1783, it had still broadly been a period of Conservative rule and Whig opposition.</p><p>Religion becomes the diving line</p><p>Religion becomes the diving line</p><p>The fissures in the Conservative factions were, however, building. Differences on free trade and protectionism, later to be a long-standing fault line, were slowly rising, as were deep divisions on individual liberty, representation and Parliamentary reform. However, following the death of Liverpool and the short-lived premiership of George Canning, under whom many Conservatives refused to serve, a split was to come as a result of Catholic Emancipation. The Ultra Tories, who held deep Anglican beliefs, broke from the governing party now led by the Duke of Wellington after the passing of the Catholic Relief Act in 1829. In the following year's election, triggered by the death of King George IV, the Conservatives were to win the most seats, but the ramifications of the split allowed the Whig Earl Grey to form a government, putting reform on the table.</p><p>The Swing Riots were to take place that year, with agricultural workers destroying threshing machines across the south of England and East Anglia. It was the largest labour unrest in English history, with many farmhouses burnt to the ground and troops and local militia deployed against the protestors. The Poor Laws, poor crop yields and returning soldiers entering the labour market were all adding fuel to the fire. Anger was often aimed at Irish migrants too, because of a belief that they were stealing jobs. But the spark lighting the unrest was still technology. Agricultural workers had seen their winter earnings decimated by steam threshing. Output was rising, increasing capital investment in technology and returns to owners. But those being hit were the workers. Swing was not to be the only unrest at the time; the riots were followed by the Merthyr Rising of miners in Wales in 1831, as people's anger continued to rise. The instability of the government resulted in another election that year. It was a Whig landslide and paved the way for the passage of the Reform Act in 1832. This reform was necessary: just 10 per cent of the British adult male population was allowed to vote before this point. If enfranchisement was politically significant, the changes were incremental: after 1832, 18 per cent of adult males in England and Wales and 12 per cent in Scotland were entitled to vote. Reform was not born out of dispassionate analysis of the country's needs but rather out of crisis, and democratisation was a product both of revolution and of the threat of one.</p><p>But out of the ashes, new shoots can grow. And in meeting the rising anger at this time, the Whigswho had often walked a fine line between radicalism and traditionalismwere representing the people's interests. While the Whigs' rising fortunes were in contrast to the decline of the Tories, the seeds of Conservative renewal were also being planted by their new leader, Sir Robert Peel. As a party of tradition, they had resisted reform and Peel himself had said he \"was unwilling to open a door\" which he \"saw no prospect of being able to close\". But in a politically febrile time he quickly sought for his party to make peace with the new settlement.</p><p>The Whigs had introduced the Factory Act in 1833, which continued to try to improve the lot of children, while a small education grant was introduced, so that the Church could begin to provide schooling. The Poor Law Amendment Act also changed the system of poor relief. But while it may have been a remedy to more parochial government, opening up the labour market, it was also seen as punitive. In political terms, however, it was enough. The Whigs held firm, finding electoral success again in 1835, although this was as much to do with their reputation as the reformers of 1832 as with the modernising force they represented. In the election campaign Peel would set out his progressivism in the Tamworth Manifesto. It committed the party to reform, but not the \"perpetual vortex of agitation\". It accepted the constitutional settlement. And it would lay the foundations for the modern Conservative Party.</p><p>Growing movements</p><p>Growing movements</p><p>Trade around the world continued to grow in the middle decades of the nineteenth century, and England was dominating European iron markets, as well as the global cotton and coal industries. As Andrew McAfee20McAfee, Andrew, \"More From Less: The surprising story of how we learned to prosper using fewer resources and what happens next,\" Scribner, 2019 has written, in 1750 the country was producing around 8 per cent of Europe's iron. Around a century later this was nearly 60 per cent, while the country was producing around half of the world's cotton and 65 per cent of its coal. Before 1825, the country had no commercial steam locomotive. By 1850, steam railways covered 6,000 miles. Engels also observed the extent of the progress in The Condition of the Working Class in England: the country now had the finest roadways and, having had no canals in 1755, it now had \"2,200 miles of canals and 1,800 miles of navigable river\".21Engels, Friedrich, \"The Condition of the Working Class in England,\" 1845</p><p>Steam was also to the hit the open waters, with Isambard Kingdom Brunel's steamship SS Great Western, launched in 1838, increasing global connectivity. With the advent of William Wheelwright's Pacific Steam Navigation Company, the markets of North and South America were opened up, with new ships carrying coal across the Atlantic. 1838 was also finally to see an end to the slave trade and the success of the abolitionist movement that had begun 50 years earlier. But the success of one struggle was accompanied by the making of another that year.</p><p>The first working-class mass movement, Chartism, was to decry the incrementalism of the Reform Act. A successor to the earlier radicalism of Tom Paine and others, the Chartists drew up a People's Charter of six demands for Parliament, which included all men having the right to vote, the professionalisation of politics by giving MPs a salary, as well as removing the requirement for MPs to own property. Their first petition was to be presented to the House of Commons the following year. It had gathered more than a million signatures, but was rejected by MPs. This contributed to the Newport rising that year, which ended in bloodshed, but the seeds had been planted. At the next election, eight Chartist candidates were to stand, although they and Viscount Melbourne's Whigs were resoundingly defeated by Peel's resurgent Conservatives.</p><p>The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was the stamp this period of government has left on British history. It marked a further step for globalisation but was also the beginning of a long-running feud in the Conservative party, in which many misdiagnosed Britain's place in a world being changed by these new forces. As the historian David Edgerton has written, today Brexit \"brings to light, in stunning clarity, Brexiters' deluded political understanding of the UK's place in the world\"22Edgerton, David, \"Brexit is a necessary crisis it reveals Britain's true place in the world,\" The Guardian, 9 October 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/09/brexit-crisis-global-capitalism-britain-place-world\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/09/brexit-crisis-global-capitalism-britain-place-world</url> , but it took a long time for that to be revealed then, with the debate stretching on into the early twentieth century. Peel had been right, but ultimately he was to pay the price for it.</p><p>Repealing the Corn Laws was not to be the only achievement of Peel's time in office. He continued his father's push on factories, with legislation in 1844 that is now known as the first health and safety act in Britain. Given the squalid nature of urban areas, the Health of Towns Commission was also formed, whichfollowing the formation of associations in cities such as Liverpool and Manchesterwould pave the way for the Public Health Act in 1848. Throughout this time the Chartist movement was still going strong: their second petition to Parliament in 1842 gained more than three million signatures. More than six miles in length, it took 30 Chartists to lift. Presenting it to the Commons, the Radical MP for Finsbury, Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, spoke of the impact he felt the forces of technology, capitalism and globalisation were having, referencing the monopolies of machinery and of the \"means of travelling and transit, and a host of other evils too numerous to mention\".23Parliamentary Debates: Official Report: Session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 63, Thomas C. Hansard, 1842 But the petition was again rejected.</p><p>New divides</p><p>New divides</p><p>Britain was still a nation of contrasts. It was self-confident, wealthy and open, with industrialists and entrepreneurs reshaping the world through the machinery of the industrial era. But in part it was still shaped by a landowning elite, who had controlled political power and contributed little to this modern technology, as well as poverty and a new \"proletariat\". Much wealth, both new and old, was built on the backs on others, with little form of trickle down in income in the short term. As with the digital transformation we are experiencing today, this was a great period of progress. But whereas today we are increasingly thinking about how we dematerialise our consumption as we increase our welfarea feat that is likely to be possible in this new technological eraconsumption during the Industrial Revolution was built on the extraction of resources.</p><p>Technological acceleration was not increasing living standards for the majority. This fact was foundational for the radical politics of the era, which sawfor examplethe publication of Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England, and (co-authored with Karl Marx) the Communist Manifesto in 1848. In the year of the Manifesto's publication, revolutions were to sweep over Europe. Countries across the continent had experienced similar levels of population growth as Britain: the Italian states had increased from around 17 to 34 million over the first half of the century, while Germany had increased from 22 to 33 million. Around 10,000 km of railways had also been laid across the continent.</p><p>As with steamships crossing the Atlantic, the growth of the railways across Europe was part of the broader opening of the world as a result of technology. The beginning stages of global infrastructure were being built. Transport, media and machinery were expanding frontiers of knowledge and the perception of possibilities, as well as everyday understanding of events. As the world opened up, however, forces of nationalism were also building as a force against economic liberalism. The German economist Friedrich List believed that liberals looked at economic policy though a \"boundless cosmopolitanism\", when between \"each individual and entire humanity, however, stands THE NATION\".24List, Friedrich, \"The National System of Political Economy,\" English translation 1885 This was in contrast to the Ricardian belief in promoting \"the happiness of mankind\", or the philosopher John Stuart Mill and Radical and Liberal statesman Richard Cobden's view that free trade and interdependence would create peace. As Mill put it, free trade was \"the principal guarantee of the peace of the world\".25Mill, John Stuart, \"Principles of Political Economy,\" 1848</p><p>With nationalism rising again today, and globalisation going through a period of deep challengeand in some places retrenchmentthis tension has again become apparent, with the USChina trade war being just one example. The difference today is that many elements of technology are now nearly universal; the global economy is far more interdependent, with intricate supply chains and systems of finance; and the internet has also given rise to innovative firms that have mastered the new economy, leading to worries about competition in the market. Some of the policy questions this has raised have their roots in the industrial era: in the US, for example, industrialisation and the growth of railroads led to the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890. This legislation has shaped the character of competition ever since, and it is again being invoked today as policymakers consider the reach and power of Big Tech firms such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. Yet much comment on this issue is reflexive, rather than reflective about the changing nature of the world economy. It is also part of a bigger debate causing splits in global politics, with protectionist and nationalistic forces of both left and right rising while economic liberals who still believe in capitalism, interdependence and the exchange of ideas and innovation as a path to prosperity are in retreat.</p><p>To fight those resisting change in Peel's time and to get the repeal of the Corn Laws through the House of Commons, he needed the support of the Whigs and the Liberals. Philosophical differences were expressed with cries of betrayal and the subsequent split in the Conservativeswith the Protectionists of Lord Stanley on one side, and the Peelite free-traders on the otherled to the Whigs forming a government with Lord John Russell as Prime Minister. A further election in 1847 saw them continuing to govern, and the Chartist leader Feargus O'Connor won a seat in Parliamentthe first and only the movement would achieve. O'Connor used his position to present the movement's last petition the following year; it was rejected for the third and final time. The tumult of the next few years and the different alignments that had now formed meant that the protectionist Conservatives were now the party of the landowning rural aristocracy. In rowing back Peel's modernisation, the Conservatives now represented the old order.</p><p>On the other side, the new PeeliteWhigRadical coalition that formed in 1852 reflected the rising diversity and cosmopolitanism that was forming in parts of Britain. With the Peelite Lord Aberdeen as Prime Minister, the coalition was to be a short-lived affair. Coming into it, Aberdeen knew it was a \"great experiment, hitherto unattempted, and of which the success must be considered doubtful\", even if the \"Public have regarded the new administration with singular favour\".26Brown, David, \"Palmerston and the politics of foreign policy, 1846-55,\" Manchester University Press, 2002 The main issue of the time was one of foreign policy. The European approach of a congress system and of federation, pursued by Aberdeen and William Gladstonewho embodied the new Victorian Liberalism and would become Prime Minister four timesclashed with a nationalistic approach favoured by Lord Palmerston and Benjamin Disraeli, the father of one-nation Conservatism and another future PM.</p><p>The government did push on with some domestic legislation: Palmerston oversaw the Factory Act of 1853, continuing a long and arduous creep towards improving industrial working conditions, especially for children. He attempted to allow trade unions to form, while the Truck Act would introduce terms under which workers were entitled to payment in money, rather than goods or tokens for employers' own shops. The Smoke Nuisance Abatement (Metropolis) Act 1853 was also the first attempt to tackle air pollution from factories that billowed out black smoke over the rapidly growing industrial towns. The end of the taxes on knowledge would also begin: advertisement duty was abolished in 1853,27Hansard, 1 July 1853, <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1853/jul/01/advertisement-duty\">https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1853/jul/01/advertisement-duty</url> and newspaper stamp duty in 1855. Paper duty would also go by 1861, with each successive move expanding the reach of newspapers and information. Gladstone's 1853 Budgetat nearly five hours, his speech was the longest to datewas momentous for the free traders, as it abolished duties on 123 items and cut them on 133 others.</p><p>Towards a two-party system</p><p>Towards a two-party system</p><p>The government had challenged Disraeli's proclamation that \"England does not love coalitions\", but the country's involvement in the Crimean War from 1854 was to put an end to this one less than three years after it begun. The realignment of these different elements of politics had, however, set a new course for parties, as economic and social change sped up during a second wave of industrialisation. Ultimately, the WhigRadical coalition was to become the Liberal Party in 1859, cementing the two-party system. A century on from the first wave of \"gadgets\", technological development had reordered British politics. The Liberal Party had morphed, becoming the modernising, reformist, open force, while the Conservatives were now the traditionalist, closed one. As is common with political parties that make sense of the world as it is, and where it is going, the Liberal Party would govern for a large part of the coming three decades, but not without turbulence.</p><p>Calls form reform were growing, as were agitations. The trade unions, who had moved away from their \"no politics\" policy of the previous decade, aligned with the radicals in pursuit of social reform and legal rights. So too had the Union victory in the American Civil War (1865) elevated the issue, with many those pushing for reform being supporters of this cause. The free trader and Radical MP, John Bright, was among them. As was Edmund Beales, who would be President of the newly founded Reform League between 186501869 and , take on the cause of the Chartists. Gladstone tabled a Reform Bill in 1866, which would have resulted in 400,000 new voters. It was to be defeated. Conservatives such as Lord Cranborne proposed the extension of franchise, lamenting the potential voters \"power of combination, their ignorance of economic laws, their strong taste for the despotism of numbers\"28Robert Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, \"The Reform Bill\", Quarterly Review, vol. 119, 1866 Aristocratic Whigs such as Lord Elcho and Lord Grosvenor were also to oppose, forming the \"Adullamites\", named after the Cave of Adullam in the Old Testament, where King David sought refuge from King Saul. Perhaps the most prominent among them was the Liberal, Robert Lowe, who did little to hide his feelings, stating that:</p><p>\"If you want venality, if you want ignorance, if you want drunkenness, and facility for being intimidated; or if, on the other hand, you want impulsive, unreflecting, violent people, where do you look for them in the constituencies? Do you go to the top or to the bottom?\"29Saunders, Robert, \"Democracy and the Vote in British Politics, 1848-1867: The Making of the Second Reform Act,\" Routledge, 2016</p><p>Even if they were sheltering from the inevitable, Russell, who was for the second time Prime Minister, had misjudged the speed of reform. Whipped up by Disraeli, the opposition would help bring down the government. The Reform Bill would, however, pass a year later. By doubling the electorate to two million it had gone much further than the one proposal just a year earlier, , before the third Reform Act in 1884 extended the franchise further and the Redistribution of Seats Act in 1885 made electoral districts equal. Not until 1928 was universal suffrage achieved.</p><p>Further changes would happen throughout this period: the Education Act 1870 laid the foundations for the universal provision of free schooling in the country. The Trade Union Act in 1871 was a founding piece of labour law and a long culmination of efforts including Owens four decade before. Further Public Health Acts were introduced in 1872 and 1875, before the 1877 Factories and Workshops Act would require education and accommodation for workers. Human capital was necessary to complement technology and multiply its effects. And health, education and rights were all crucial to this end.</p><p>The issue of housing had been growing throughout the nineteenth century, as urbanisation also picked up pace. Technology increased choice, with many people feeling liberated from rural life. The concentration of people in urban areas rose dramatically. In 1800 it had been around 20 per cent. A century later it was nearly 70 per cent. As a result, the slums of Victorian England were swelling. Joseph Bazalgette's sewer network had been completed, removing some of the cesspools and, along with John Snow's insights on the origins of cholera, helped improve public health. But families often lived in single rooms in which they would \"sleep and eat, multiply, and die.\"30Salisbury, Lord, \"Labourers' and Artisans' Dwellings,\" The National Review, 1883 The governing principle up until this point had been a predominantly laissez-faire approach that favoured personal responsibility, particularly among the Conservatives. Yet with Lord Salisbury leading a Conservative government three times between 1886 and 1902, the response to the housing situation saw a shift towards some state intervention. With the establishment of the London County Council (LCC), as well as the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890, slums could be cleared, while social housing could be built. The first of these would be the Boundary estate in Shoreditch, which included 58 workshops and 200 costermongers' shed. On the construction of the estate, the infamous Old Nichol Street slum was cleared. Lord Salisbury would later express regret for being swayed by socialism, but he set a precedent. Ten years later the act would be extended so that all councils could build houses. By the beginning of World War I nearly 24,000 homes had been built. The founding of the LCC and the Local Government Act 1888 was also a landmark moment in the beginning of decentralisation in UK politics. Technology, internal migration and surging local economies had created disparate needs in different areas. Such complexity was hard to manage through central control. But if the Industrial Revolution was to change the location of power in politics, it was also to change the makeup of politics again. A two-party system had been broadly stable, but with around three-quarters of the population now manual workers, employed by others, the working-class movement was growing.</p><p>Beginnings of the Labour movement</p><p>Beginnings of the Labour movement</p><p>With the 1892 election, the split in the Liberal Party over the question of Irish Home Rule took centre stage for the party. The Liberal Unionists were aligned with the Conservatives, but Gladstone was able to form a minority Liberal government, taking office for the fourth and final time. Ireland was to dominate his agenda, but the Newcastle Programme was also to push the party in a radical direction, cementing the growing New Liberalism. Social reform was a key element as the party sought to come to terms with the growing economic and political strength of organised Labour. Yet the programme was not enacted, and if it was designed to build working-class support and prevent the formation of a separate Labour party, it was not fully successful: in 1893 the Independent Labour Party was formed by Keir Hardie, who had started out as a Liberal, among others.</p><p>The overlap of both strains of politics was easy to see. Liberals had long been allies of Labour, and had developed links with trade unions, including the TUC. As Herbert Gladstone (a Liberal politician, and son of William) wrote at the time, \"it is the duty of the Liberal party to frankly hold out the hand of friendship to Labour\". For many Liberals, there was a place for Labour within the Liberal Party, or at least within the Liberal tradition as part of a \"progressive alliance\". This was in part because Labour was not really founded on a doctrine; it was essentially a pressure group whose focus was representing workers and safeguarding the unions. It did not represent an ideal, but rather an interest. The step towards an overarching ideology was made in 1918 with Clause IV's commitment to extend public ownership. For some, the movement was a necessary response to the new capitalist economy of the industrial era: as the economist Ralph Miliband was to later write, capitalism \"badly needs\" Labour \"since it plays a major role in the management of discontent and helps to keep it within safe bounds\".31John Callaghan, Steve Fielding, Steve Ludlam, \"Interpreting the Labour Party: Approaches to Labour Politics and History,\" 2003 But with Britain having avoided any genuine \"bourgeois revolution\" in the nineteenth century, there was little genuine socialist tradition in the country. Labour was in some ways more an offshoot of liberalism than a full-blown revolutionary movement. As the historian Ross McKibbin has written, some of the penny capitalists of that era exulted in \"a jaunty and attractive individualism [that] was essential to life\"32McKibbin, Ross, \"The Ideologies of Class: Social Relations in Britain 1880-1950,\" 1993 ,and unionism rates were low: by 1901 only around 15 per cent of the workforce were part of a union. Industry was fragmented, and dominated by small and medium enterprise, while wages were relatively high.</p><p>But Labour was rising, with movements such as Tom Mann's Eight Hour League calling for working-day restrictions. Industrial action was also more common: as the historian David Powell has written, \"over thirty million working days were lost in stoppages in 1893\"33Powell, David, \"The Liberal Ministries and Labour, 1892-1895.\" History, vol. 68, no. 224, 1983, pp. 408426. JSTOR,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24417598\">www.jstor.org/stable/24417598</url> , while more than 10 million were lost in 1897 and 15 million in 1898.</p><p>As a result, the Liberals were trying to find a balance between laissez-faire capitalism and the collectivist state. Leonard Hobhouse, who was averse to Marxist socialism and would be an influential thinker in New Liberalism, was critical of individualism and developed ideas around collectivism, in what he would later adapt to be liberal socialism. In a Fabian pamphlet published in 1995 our Executive Chairman, Tony Blair, traced the origins of New Labour to this time. As he wrote:</p><p>\"The 'progressive dilemma' is rooted in the history of social and economic reform in Britain. Up to 1914 that history was defined by the Liberal Party's efforts to adapt to working class demands. This involved the gradual replacement of the classical liberal ideology based on non-intervention and 'negative freedom' with a credo of social reform and state action to emancipate individuals from the vagaries and oppressions of personal circumstance ... The intellectual bridgehead was established by Hobhouse and others. They saw the nineteenth-century conception of liberty as too thin for the purposes of social and economic reform, so they enlarged it. They realised that theoretical liberty was of little use if people did not have the ability to exercise it. So they argued for collective action, including state action, to achieve positive freedom, even if it infringed traditional laissez-faire liberal orthodoxy.\"34<url normalizedValue=\"https://liberalhistory.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/55_Holmes_Hobhouse_and_Hobson.pdf\">https://liberalhistory.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/55_Holmes_Hobhouse_and_Hobson.pdf</url></p><p>This thinking was a political necessity: the Reform and Redistribution Acts had made courting the working-class vote crucial. The integration of Lib-Labs in the previous elections such as 1892 as a progressive alliance had been part of the attempts to ensure this. And commitments to social reform and state intervention from the New Liberals were key to maintaining Labour's electoral support. Reflecting this new balance, the Liberal Chancellor, William Harcourt, stressed that it was \"impossible to discriminate between capital and labour as the forces of national prosperity.\"35Powell, David, \"The New Liberalism and the Rise of Labour, 1886-1906.\" The Historical Journal, vol. 29, no. 2, 1986, pp. 369393. JSTOR, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2639067\">www.jstor.org/stable/2639067</url></p><p>The middle ground of the Liberals was proving more powerful in electoral terms at this time. In the 1895 election 28 candidates stood for the Independent Labour Party. Allincluding Keir Hardie, who had won a seat as an independent in 1892lost, with the Conservative-Unionist coalition forming a government. For some in the Labour movement, their closeness to the Liberals was part of the problem; a more assertive approach was needed. The result was the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) being formed in 1900. They won one seat in that year's election, which was again won by Conservative-Unionist forces. The government later split over the issue of free trade, a debate that had started with the Corn Laws, and Joseph Chamberlain led the Liberal Unionists out of the coalition in 1904. Mounting attacks by the Conservatives on free trade were also matched by those on trade unionism. Worried about the progressive vote being split, the Liberals and Labour formed an electoral pact in 1903.</p><p>Known as the GladstoneMacDonald pact after Herbert Gladstone, who was then the Liberals' Chief Whip, and Ramsay MacDonald, a senior member of the LRC, the agreement helped the Liberals to a historic landslide in 1906. The LRC, which was to become the Labour Party that year, took 29 seats. The election ushered in a period of transformational change in British social policy. This started with Henry Campbell-Bannerman's introduction of old age pensions and free school meals, and with the 1906 Trade Disputes Act restoring immunity from legal action to the unions, Labour was broadly on side with the Liberals' reforms. Rising unemployment in the coming years would test this relationship, but Chancellor David Lloyd George's 1909 budget truly kicked off a deep period of radical policymaking. The alliance between the parties would essentially remain in place until the onset of World War I. It was in part driven by a shared commitment to social reform as well as a visceral dislike of the Conservatives. Yet the association would be completely redrawn by the war and by divisions and opposition within Labour and with the Liberals, not least around the issue of conscription. In the aftermath of the war, Labour's new party constitution essentially recast the party as a socialist one, with a demand for \"immediate nationalisation and democratic control of vital public services, such as mines, railways, shipping, armaments, and electric power.\"361918 Labour Party Manifesto,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1918/1918-labour-manifesto.shtml\">http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1918/1918-labour-manifesto.shtml</url> It would also seal the fate of the Lib-Lab alliance, creating obstacles that were hard to bridge.</p><p>Reflecting on this period, the academic and former Labour MP David Marquand 37Marquand, David, \"The Progressive Dilemma: From Lloyd George to Kinnock,\" Heinemann, 1991 believes that Labour would have fully integrated into a progressive alliance if the war had not proved such a fault line. Ultimately Labour would enter government in 1924 under MacDonald, while the Liberals would fade, pushing the country back towards to a two-state system. And a long line of transformations with their origins in technological change would continue. By this time, the economy had dramatically altered: as the economic historian Nicholas Crafts has set out, by the beginning of World War I Britain was a leading capital exporter.38Crafts, Nicholas, \"Walking wounded: The British economy in the aftermath of World War I, VoxEU.org 27 August 2014,<url normalizedValue=\"https://voxeu.org/article/walking-wounded-british-economy-aftermath-world-war-i\">https://voxeu.org/article/walking-wounded-british-economy-aftermath-world-war-i</url>\"&gt;</p><p>Its net property income from abroad accounted for about 9 per cent of GDP, it was responsible for more than a quarter of the world's manufactured exports, and it share of trade in GDP (54 per cent) was greater than those of Germany (40 per cent) or the United States (10 per cent). The country was an enthusiastic participant in globalisation. Tariffs, an issue that had long beset the Conservative Party and would return in the years between the wars, were around 3 per cent on manufactures and around 1 per cent on agricultural goods. Technological investment was driving productivity, and GDP per capita was around $5,000. The country was not without challenges, but it had found a stable position: competitive industries, open to the world, not laissez-faire, but also not state-driven; and a balance had been struck between capital and labour.</p><p>Britain was not alone in this position. Other industrial nations, such as America, Germany, France and Sweden, had begun flourishing at the beginning of the twentieth century. Alongside the widening of political participation, many people's incomes and means of self-support also increased. The old power structures of the few had been broken down, as innovation had liberated people. This permeated nations from the bottom up, just as the potential of the new digital age will also be realised through decentralised and distributed entrepreneurship. Politics should be guiding the institutions and people towards this future, inviting experimentation and nurturing new ideas and knowledge.</p><p>Some rhymes of history</p><p>Some rhymes of history</p><p>Progress is a necessity, but it is not given. It is often extremely messy. The settlement of the industrial era took a long time to find; and it would not last. Some of the tensions that were revealed throughout the process were also exposed intermittently throughout the twentieth century, as globalisation sped up, just as technological development did. The most pertinent of these is the question of jobs, particularly as technology has replaced jobs, rather than assisting in the performance of them. The Industrial Revolution was itself mostly worker-replacing, as machines uprooted employment, while the era of electrification that came in the first half of the twentieth century was primarily augmenting. It also saw the mass expansion of welfare and education.</p><p>Issues that arose in the Industrial Revolution were to resurface in the coming decades. Speenhamland, for example, has influenced policy intermittently through the ages. As the journalist Nathan Heller has written, the US President Richard Nixon read about the issue as he was preparing a radical new poverty-alleviation programme. Worried about moral hazard and the incentives to worklessness that a guaranteed income created, he changed tack: \"the beginning of a push that led the President's program, the Family Assistance Plan, toward a work requirementan element that he had not included until then\".39Heller, Nathan, \"Who Really Stands to Win from Universal Basic Income?\" The New Yorker, July 9 and 16, 2018 Issue,</p><p>Speenhamland's influence on American social policy continued far beyond Nixon, with the earned-income tax credit and Bill Clinton's welfare reform. A similar system was introduced in the UK under New Labour. Laying out his vision for this in his first Budget as Chancellor in 1997, Gordon Brown stated that welfare \"denies rather than provides opportunity\", and that it was time for the \"welfare state to put opportunity back into people's hands.\"40Budget Statement 1997,<url normalizedValue=\"https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1997/jul/02/budget-statement\">https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1997/jul/02/budget-statement</url></p><p>This issue has also been revisited in the discussion around Universal Basic Income. In the US, the fringe candidate in the campaign for the 2020 presidential election Andrew Yang has made UBI the centrepiece of his campaign, calling it the freedom dividend. In the UK, the Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, has also mooted the possibility of a trial for UBI, while various other experiments have been run in countries such as Finland, Canada and Spain. It is also the favoured policy of many in Silicon Valley, but its consequences are likely to be vast. From a moral perspective it raises questions about identity, purpose and value that many people experience as a result of work. From a societal perspective, there are huge second-order questions too: would schools continue to exist, for example, if people have no economic function and have no need to worry about an income?</p><p>It is right that politics looks at issues like these early. They are almost certainly bound to be central to society in the coming years. Policymaking needs to be far more adaptive to deal with them. Issues such as housing and large-scale infrastructure have revealed the stasis in the UK system, with big decisions unable to be taken.</p><p>Politics also needs a clearer picture of what is happening under the surface, as an excessive focus on the macro level often fails to deal with underlying concerns that can boil over. Today, the force of this has been felt through political oscillations such as Brexit and populism. Partly this has been driven by economic factors: for example, David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson have written about this in their \"China Shock\" paper 41David H. Autor and David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson, 2016. \"The China Shock: Learning from Labor Market Adjustment to Large Changes in Trade,\" Annual Review of Economics, vol 8(1)., causing economists to think more about the distributional aspects and labour market flexibility in the modern economy. Throughout most of the modern economic era, people have not made substantial alterations in their employmentswitching, for example, from making car parts in a factory to serving fast foodbut the shifting nature of work today has begun to change this. The pace of new types of jobs being created has increased, but so too has the half-life of skills needed to do them. What have been concentrated disruption effects could become more widespread and could collide with cultural transformations as the world continues to open up.</p><p>For proponents of technological change, globalisation, free trade and open and liberal economies, this raises questions about how to continue to look both at the edges, to see where parts are fraying, as well as the whole picture. For example, the discussion around the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership included a consideration of labour standards that went well beyond those in previous trade agreements, but this is unlikely to assuage fears many face about the precariousness of work. Nor are technocratic details likely win in a debate against \"Make America Great Again\", which tapped into some of the emotions of the age.</p><p>Progressives need to be much quicker in addressing issues such as education, training, social welfare and the stasis in living standards some are experiencing. The response to this should not be trying to take greater control, to combat and slow down events that are rarely driven by policy, but rather by people. Nor is eroding people's living standards by de-growthing the right way forward. During the nineteenth century, the economist Alfred Marshall observed that humans desire \"not merely larger quantities of the things he has been accustomed to consume, but better qualities of those things; he desires a greater choice of things, and things that will satisfy new wants growing up in him\"42Marshall, Alfred, \"Principles of Economics,\" 1890. The same still holds true, and it is right that the value of GDP as a standalone metric is being called into question; in particular, a greater examination of and focus on happiness is important. But people will still want to see progress, even if not entirely material.</p><p>The fundamental question for progressives is how to achieve this. Technology will be key. It has suffused every part of our society in a much larger way than the Industrial Revolution did, and it will continue to pervade every part of our lives. It should therefore be central to politics in the future.</p><p>Reordering institutions today</p><p>Reordering institutions today</p><p>At its most fundamental this will require reordering institutions so that they are of this age. The speed at which the market has optimised, individualised and tailored our lives has been extraordinary. So too has the pace at which we have reduced the amount of cash in our economies: Sweden, for example, has seen a 50 per cent decrease over the last decade. But government is essentially the same and people's sense of disconnection from it is growing. The idea of government as platform has been partly pursued in the UK, based on entrepreneur and tech theorist Tim O'Reilly's proposal that it should become the \"vehicle for coordinating the collective action of citizens\"43O'Reilly, Tim, \"Government As a Platform,\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/open-government/9781449381936/ch02.html\">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/open-government/9781449381936/ch02.html</url> , aggregating demand for common needs while disaggregating supply in local delivery.</p><p>This new theory of state rejects the old orthodoxies about the size of government and what it does and doesn't control. Instead, government sets the standards and builds the basic ecosystem on which others innovate. It requires government to reject command and control and decentralise power, just as the great reform acts of the industrial era did. This is necessary to create the dynamism needed in modern economies, but it will also be demanded by the people if the pace of change of society continues to misalign with that of politics. The perpetual vortex that has been created by Brexit was in some ways intended to stave off these demands, but people will be less forgiving if growth and living standards erode and government has done very little to address the fundamental issues in society.</p><p>Part of this reordering will be necessary to realise the potential of frontier technologies, not least artificial intelligence. There are already many instances of where AI can be applied in ways that make the human mind obsolete, with consequent fears that automation will spill further and further up the skills chain. Jobs and opportunities will almost certainly be created, but the future of work is an issue that needs to be addressed. Radiologists, for example, are already at risk, while surgeons may have a couple of decades left as the masters of their craft. Google's recently announced breakthrough in quantum computing could also push the technological curve even further out.</p><p>What might this mean for public policy?</p><p>What might this mean for public policy?</p><p>In many ways, the potential impacts of technology are unforeseeable. This is why Malthus and many after him have failed to account for technological change. But discounting or dismissing its potential has tended to be a poor guide to the future. Technology is going to reshape the public sphere and its services: the question is how.</p><p>In the short term, schools and education establishments are likely to continue to divert from their traditional form. Pupils will no longer all need to sit and listen and learn at the same speed. Instead, education could be personalised at scale so that it is no longer the preserve of the wealthy. It can also augment the experience, with nearly infinite resources and new applications changing the way we learn. Understanding the history of the French Revolution could be a VR experience, while platforms can create digital spaces for collaborative learning. This would not mean replacing teachers, but simply working in unison with technology to allow teachers to spend more time on the issues that truly transform individual students' experiences.</p><p>In health, as well as interpreting medical scans, skin lesions and retina scans to screen and triage people, deep learning has also been applied to predict clinical outcomes from electronic health records, to process massive datasets from genome sequencing and for use in drug discovery that could revolutionise pharmacology. Palliative care can be more precise with the application of new devices, but limitations around bias, accuracy and privacy and security require data systems and structures to be reordered. Within a generation technology could change our care infrastructure; hospitals may be necessary only in emergency cases, as new technology can predict and prevent illness without the need to visit a doctor. There is also a possibility that medical care can be provided on a far greater global scale, making it a much wider public good. But data access and governance will be key to achieving this.</p><p>In transport, autonomous vehicles (AV) will completely reshape our infrastructure and urban planning as we know it, while new technologies such as those being developed by Lilium could see alternative modes of transport in the very near future. Cars are hugely inefficient: they are idle for the majority of the time; parking density is a problem; and congestion and pollution are by-products. Infrastructure is also hugely expensive. But all of this can be addressed by policy. The political calculus, however, is difficult. To many members of the public, autonomous vehicles are still a thing of sci-fi; questions about ethics, liabilities and a new social contract are not being discussed in small villages, for example, where the car is an integral form of mobility. For many is it understandably an enjoyable and liberating possession, so redesigning systems and cities built around the car will be no small feat. But pilots are happening all around the world, and the question with AV is when, not if. There will be an inflection point, which will see a dramatic change in a very short period of time.</p><p>How we create energy and use resources can also be drastically altered. Climate change is a pressing issue, but it is not intractable. It is a subject in which the narratives are often binary: doom and gloom, or denial. Some Conservatives started in the former camp: in a speech in 1990 at the 2nd World Climate Conference, Margaret Thatcher said, \"The danger of global warming is as yet unseen, but real enough for us to make changes and sacrifices, so that we do not live at the expense of future generations.\"44Margaret Thatcher, Speech at 2nd World Climate Conference,As with many on the right, she was later to change tack when climate change became entangled with anti-capitalist politics, putting conservatives in the odd position of being anti-preservationist. But there is a way to reconcile both points: things are bad, but they can get better. Technology is key to ensuring that positive change occurs. This was at the heart of the 1980 wager between the economists Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon. They bet whether the price of resourcescopper, chromium, nickel, tin and tungstenwould rise over the next decade. Simon was the optimist and the victor, and would likely be again today if he made the same bet. Developed nations' growth is increasingly decoupling from the use of resources, there has been a huge growth in renewable energy, and more than $30 trillion of funds are held in sustainable or green investments.</p><p>The latest Bloomberg New Energy Outlook45<url normalizedValue=\"https://about.bnef.com/new-energy-outlook\">https://about.bnef.com/new-energy-outlook</url>/ predicts that solar power, which accounts for about 2 per cent of energy production today, will be up to 22 per cent by 2050, and wind, which today stands at 5 per cent, will reach 26 per cent. The fall in cost in both of these technologies since 2010 has been 85 per cent and 49 per cent respectively. But electricity represents only about a quarter of carbon emissions, and innovation is essential. AI is being applied to increase the efficiency of energy as it is currently delivered, maximising the use of the grid and attempting to minimise the impact of data storage centres. New technologies are also being developed, while existing ones such as solar, geothermal, wind and storage are increasingly being optimised and rethought, with replacements for lithium-ion batteries, for example, being explored. But even if efficiency increases, we need to cognisant of biophysical reality of our world: every effort must go into minimising environmental degradation. We cannot rely on the possibilities of technology alone. As the Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Romer has put it, policy choices really matter and the \"what the theory of endogenous technological progress supports is conditional optimism, not complacent optimism.\"46      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://paulromer.net/conditional-optimism-technology-and-climate\">https://paulromer.net/conditional-optimism-technology-and-climate</url>/</p><p>In the longer term, the impacts of technological change are likely to be larger, even including a reimagining of the nation state. One of the impacts of the technological innovation of the Industrial Revolution was the reordering of the structures of power. Mass industrialisation lowered the cost of paper, extending the reach of media. Speaking in the House of Commons in 1787, Edmund Burke was alleged to have said that \"there were three Estates ... but in the Reporters Gallery yonder, there sat a fourth Estate more important far than they all.\"47Carlyle, Thomas, \"On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History,\" 1841 Radio, television and internet all changed the dynamics of this ecosystem further, with those who mastered the modern forms of communication flourishing. Social media has accelerated this processso much so that in a recent speech48Mark Zuckerberg speech, Georgetown University,<url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/10/mark-zuckerberg-stands-for-voice-and-free-expression/\">https://about.fb.com/news/2019/10/mark-zuckerberg-stands-for-voice-and-free-expression/</url> at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg spoke about the internet essentially being the Fifth Estate, massing the mass media. The current masters of this realm in political terms are often those who combine simplicity and stridency, often with little shame. The crudest parts of politics have often been compounded.</p><p>Having more access to information markets has brought more social symmetry, albeit with the nodes of society connected in very different ways, with interconnected groups of people who share interests finding common ground online. In turn, this has created and confirmed people's interests. Positive movements such as Black Lives Matter have grown, while pockets of society that were previously inaccessible have climbed down from their ivory towers. Societies have opened up and redrawn their borders, importing and inputting into a vast cornucopia of ideas and information. The internet is essentially an imaginarium, in which ideas and new knowledge can be created ad infinitum. But there have been almost inescapable trade-offs, as those with pernicious or extremist views have often found new sanctuaries online, and problems that have simmered under the surface in societies for a long time have boiled over. For more closed nations, the internet has also often been a broadly centralising force: a tool with which they can exert greater control over their citizens.</p><p>Those who believe in the open society, and the opportunity that the digital world has brought, need to raise their voices against those seeking control. They need to rethink regulation. Rather than having bureaucratic regulators designed for legacy industries, as Chris Yiu set outs in a New Deal for Big Tech, a \"new approach, based on stronger accountability coupled with more freedom to innovate, is the best way to align private incentives with the public interest\". Principles should shape the digital environment, rather than overly onerous controls. The interconnected nature of the world means that this is also best applied between nations that share similar values, in a shared approach to shaping the future. The forward-looking aspect of this is key: the pace of change means that diagnoses of some of the problems of the recent past, may not still stand up. Policy should not retrofit. The debate around breaking up Big Tech is the most prominent example of this, as it is unclear what it would achieve. Nevertheless there are deep questions around competition and the current trend towards centralisation, not least with the prevalence of mergers and acquisitions and how the incumbents' power is skewing the market. Policy must guide the path, so that innovation continues to occur and competition increases, while the downsides continue to be addressed.</p><p>Politics itself is unlikely to be immune to reform as people become frustrated by the inability of politicians to achieve meaningful changes while everything around them continues to speed up. Part of the reaction by many politicians has been pandering, rather than the hard task of leading people through change. Relationships between the populace can be far closer today because of technology, and if harnessed well, this may facilitate a type of participatory democracy that has long been mooted. This needs to be an integral part of the political discussion today. The dislocation between change-makers and policymakers needs to be addressed, but so too does the distance of debate in politics between the issues that will fundamentally affect people and those which are either essentially trivial, or deeply troubling. Talk of a wall on the USMexican border, for example, energised people around crude symbolism. Adapting to the modern world and embracing the opportunities that openness can bring takes much greater political courage. Rejecting it and stirring up nationalistic fervour under the false pretence of progress will ultimately backfire.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>From its beginnings with technological breakthroughs in the eighteenth century, the Industrial Revolution altered life in monumental ways. Population growth rocketed; so too did life expectancy. Economic growth took off, while the world became connected through new forms of transport. In the UK, it reshaped social policy: first labour, health and housing laws were introduced. It started a conversation that resulted in the welfare state. Ultimately, it also upended the power structures and politics that existed previously, with the extension of the franchise and the democratision of political life. But it took a long time for this to happen. Industrialisation opened up a near continual debate between old and new, tradition and modernity, open and closed. Almost every political force that thrived did so because it adapted to the needs of the modern world, understanding the change that was occurring.</p><p>Today, the pace of change is increasing. When the Luddites who smashed frames in 1812 were shipped to Australia, the journey would have taken three months. A recently launched flight connecting London to Perth takes less than a day. Letters took days to cross Britain, whereas 23 billion texts and nearly 300 billion emails are now sent around the world every day. The rising middle class in London during the Industrial Revolution became the \"new social fields for the imported pineapple to conquer,\"49O'Connor, Kaori, \"Pineapple: A Global History,\" 2013 while Amazon can today ship more than 100 million products almost instantaneously. We have more choice and are better connected than ever, and yet the forces of both left and right that are rising are both fundamentally conservative in their nature.</p><p>Both have tapped into discontent. One is essentially nationalist, drawing on the security that people find in building group identity. This is particularly acute in times of declining control, potentially more precarious futures and continually evolving society. The left, which rose out of tackling the hardship many workers felt during the Industrial Revolution, has identified a disquiet in workers who are being left behind in the modern economy. Yet their diagnosis is to roll back time, to give the state greater control, rather than reform and modernise.</p><p>Technology has played its part in driving these trends, but it can also be the solution. It should form the basis of how we reorder government so that it is more responsive in meeting the desires and needs of people in the modern world. Fundamental to this is ceding control and building a strong platform for others to build upon. The theory of the state has to change dramatically, so that it is about small or big, laissez-faire or interventionist, but is instead agile, easy to manoeuvre and provides the basis for innovation and competition to flourish in the economy. It needs to encourage technological development, but also its diffusion into societybuilding a country's absorptive capacity. Too often, there is little focus on the latter. This will require a greater focus on human capital, including on the nature of work. There must be a continual focus on people's lifecycle, from providing the right education at school to encouraging flexible workers who can adapt to more fluid labour markets. For political parties mass mobilisation is going to be key. They must not be constrained by the ideology of previous eras but realise that technology-led innovation guided by societal objectives is the path to prosperity and power. The climate is going to be a key concern; counter to the Industrial Revolution's growth by extraction, the focus should be on how we dematerialise. As the digital economy researcher Andrew MacAfee has written, hardware, software and networks should be utilised so that we can adapt to using \"fewer metals, minerals, fertilizer, water, cropland, trees, fossil fuels, and other resources of the earth.\" Health policy, too, has long been the victim of political stasis and conservatism. We can completely reorder the system, so that it is personalised, predictive and focused on prevention rather than treatment. A precondition for this will be having a much more honest debate over access to data, which can be liberating for the individual, but is too often embroiled in scaremongering.</p><p>All of these issues are going to be forced on politics at some point, just as the Industrial Revolution forced them on politicians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The effect of these technological trends is powerful and broad. Attempts to fight on them on fringe issues, rather than confront the major benefits they can bring, are short-termist and will ultimately backfire. Progressive politicians must therefore make technology central to their new programme, showing that they are the modernising forces adapting to the new world, rather than trying to maintain the status quo, or returning to ideas of old. They need to show they are at least in step with, or ahead of society againbecause right now, politics is trying to lead from behind. And it is heading in the wrong direction.</p><p>Footnotes</p><p>Marc Andreessen, \"Why Software Is Eating The World\", Wall Street Journal, 20 August 2011 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460</url></p><p>Ashton, T.

In 2009, a paper was published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It described a system that would rely on a 'decentralized' network of computers to facilitate the peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of value that value being Bitcoins. </p><p>Rather than having a reliable 'authority' (aka centralized banks) keep the ledger and preside over the network, everyone kept an eye on everyone else's transaction ledgers. The concept of cryptocurrency enabled fundamentally new forms of social organization based on a decentralized network, connecting supply and demand in ways that was never possible before. For this very reason, the race to mine and buy Bitcoin took off. But not before pro-centralizing organizations had their go at the digital currency. Because of the fundamental challenge this cryptocurrency posed to the notion of money itself, bitcoin was banned by many countries worldwide. All in an attempt to keep banking and money centralized. Now let's fast forward 10 years. In mid-2019 Facebook announced plans for its own cryptocurrency called Libra. Governments around the world were especially nervous about the social media giant taking a seat at the cryptocurrency table. Backed by 28 companies, tech giants and nonprofit organizations, the coming of Libra posed a serious threat to the global financial system. Facebooks has 2.4 billion users worldwide, and if Libra became popular, it could harness the potential to create a widely-used, global financial system that could compete with government-backed currencies like the dollar and the euro And capitalists would not want that. Needless to say, US regulators' hostile approach to Libra eventually led to a drafting of 'Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act'. Besides banning large platform companies from performing banking functions, the bill also blocked Libra developments from moving forward unless it addressed concerns over privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability. So why in 2020, is the USA passing a bill for mandatory digital wallets which utilize cryptocurrency? <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.neweurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WhatsApp-Image-2020-04-20-at-21.05.47.jpeg\">https://www.neweurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WhatsApp-Image-2020-04-20-at-21.05.47.jpeg</url> Because the digital dollar or digidollar, which comes as part of the COVID-19 stimulus package, technically isn't a cryptocurrency. It's backed and monitored by the federal banking system as opposed to being based on a decentralized blockchain system like other cryptocurrencies. The digidollar, a currency which the government can track, is in itself a paradox to the very nature of cryptocurrencies because it's not anonymous or untraceable. In this light, it would be safe to assume that this bill is just a way to speed up the digitization process. A process which, according to conspiracy theorist David Icke, is but a perfect means to attain greater control over citizens' hard earned money and eventually their freedom. Masked as an effort to stop the spread of deadly pandemics like the coronavirus, there is a collective effort to exterminate the use of cash money by governments all over the globe. In reality, these strategic steps are moving society towards a totalitarian regime where all your (digital) money is controlled by the government who can wipe your accounts, and maybe even your existence, with one click. Fast forward a couple more months and the coronavirus pandemic is spreading throughout the globe. In an effort to focus more on his philanthropic investments Bill Gates announced that he was resigning from his position at Microsoft. Shortly after he made headlines again when he announced plans to finanse 7 vaccination factories in the fight against COVID-19. Revealed in a later statement, Gates stated that he would be moving forward to manufacturing with only 1-2 of the 7 factories he financed. When asked about the billions of dollars that would go into financing 5 factories that he wasn't planning on using, Gates replied by saying that 'it was worth it'. What will happen to the other 5 factories? The answer could be in patent WO2020060606. On March 26 2020, Patent Scope published a patent which describes in great detail the use of human body activity to mine cryptocurrency, aptly named 'Cryptocurrency System Using Body Activity Data' owned by none other than Microsoft Technologies. The patent was actually filed on June 20, 2019 but it was only published after Bill Gates resigned from Microsoft to do more humanitarian good. Let's get back to the patent itself. The description for the patent describes a system where humans are linked to a server which gives them real world tasks that, when carried out, generate energy from body activity. The energy generated from body activity is then used to mine cryptocurrency. Human bodies mining digital currency If this sounds like some dystopian alien universe where all life forms are all working to generate energy for an unknown cause, it's probably because you've seen Rick and Morty's, 'The Ricks Must Be Crazy' episode where this very same scenario plays out in a cringy Rick and Morty sense of humor. It seems as though Bill Gates resigned from the board of Microsoft just in time to disassociate himself from any involvement in using humans to mine cryptocurrency. As for the 5 factories that seem to be 'useless', it wouldn't be far-fetched to assume that Bill Gates's philanthropic endeavours will find a good way to make use of them. Afterall, he's going to need a big space to build his human hamster wheel. The race to digitalisation has started. The credit system being used in China to monitor every aspect of citizens' lives together with the digital wallet bill planned for 2021 in the US are among the first leaps towards the inevitable digitalized world that awaits.

After Farrow's devastating article, Ito relinquished these posts, along with his only British directorship, of LSE-listed PureTech Health.</p><p>Ito had used Epstein to procure funding both for his own investment vehicles, as well as the Media Lab, despite knowing of Epstein's conviction and his toxic reputation.</p><p>Ito appears to have concealed the extent of his involvement to faculty and staff, referring to Epstein as Voldemort, the Harry Potter embodiment of evil: \"he who must not be named\".</p><p>Appointed in 2011, in any other era Ito would have been be a bizarre choice to lead a prominent new department at MIT. Such prized roles at an institution that forged its reputation in the space race were traditionally occupied by distinguished engineers and scientists.</p><p>And before Silicon Valley, America's computing industry was clustered around Boston and the university, with giants like DEC and IBM eager to snap up graduates.</p><p>Breaking the mould</p><p>Yet by his own admission, Ito wasn't technical and wasn't even a \"reading or writing\" kind of guy.</p><p>He had dropped out of a Harvard physics course in dismay, after being sternly told he couldn't \"intuit\" a physics concept being taught that day\u00a0but had to \"learn\" it instead. His venture capital fund (and blog) was called Neoteny, meaning extended childhood or the delaying of adulthood.</p><p>But the Media Lab was always an unusual and exotic flower in the MIT garden, producing graduates like Jonah Peretti, the founder of<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epsteins-victims-say-search-justice-must-go/\">BuzzFeed</url> .</p><p>The institution's legacy is less in its output - for very little has proved commercially successful let alone a landmark in human endeavour - and more in pioneering a new kind of glib futurist or networker.</p><p>It is a role that has crossed the Atlantic with ease, notes one British inventor and entrepreneur. \"In Oxford at the moment, it seems that every other person is writing a book about 'AI ethics' or setting up a futurology institute,\" laments Andrew Fentem, who pioneered the multi-touch technology that provided the foundation for the smartphone boom.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epsteins-victims-say-search-justice-must-go/\">Joi of tech | The world according to Ito</url></p><p>Fentem calls this \"a new professional class of the innovation guru\", self-appointed experts in all things novel, who began to emerge from business schools and quangos in the early Nineties.</p><p>\"They go to TED talks and business school events about disruptive innovation. While they love\u00a0talking about AI and 'the blockchain',\u00a0they'd struggle to connect up their hi-fi.\"</p><p>Ito's trip</p><p>Besides a puppyish enthusiasm for the internet, Ito's calling card was a brief association with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epsteins-victims-say-search-justice-must-go/\">late LSD guru Timothy Leary</url> . Apple founder Steve Jobs had also been influenced by LSD and enthused about the personal computer as a \"bicycle for the mind\".</p><p>Unlike Jobs, however, Ito viewed psychedelics and computers as a utopian instrument for reconfiguring society and politics, as intrinsically moral, and unambiguously good.</p><p>While Ito's New Age musings scarcely amount to a coherent adult philosophy, he was consistent in battling what he saw as the shackles of intellectual property laws\u00a0and steered the wealthy foundations to support the agenda.</p><p>\"Ito was part of a circle that believed that intellectual property rights represented a barrier to innovation and were a legacy to be disrupted,\" says Neil Turkewitz, a former executive for the recording industry lobby group RIAA, who locked horns with the techno utopians at international meetings.</p><p>\"Consequences were irrelevant in Silicon Valley's quest to be free from regulatory burdens or the rule of law,\" he adds.</p><p>With Western companies facing the theft of their own ideas by piratical Chinese rivals, Ito's radical attempts to dismantle intellectual property rights may appear less shrewd today.</p><p>Another more subtle consequence was organisational gurus' enthusiasm for open collaboration - hence Slack chats, and design features such as open office plans.</p><p>According to the open collaboration enthusiasts, the sheer volume of communication is diagnostic for the health of a company. Only recently have other business experts questioned the idea that more chatter isn't necessarily better.</p><p>The Media Lab story goes back 30 years to the height of the Reagan era. The institution was the brainchild of Nicholas Negroponte, then a well-connected professor at MIT.</p><p>Negroponte envisaged a new kind of academia. The Lab would be a flashy demo vehicle for new media. Whilst\u00a0publishers were sceptical, it acquired the backing of the East Coast's blue chip computer establishment, IBM and DEC, also nervous about missing the next big thing.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epsteins-victims-say-search-justice-must-go/\">Friends of friends | Ito's allies in the tech aristocracy</url></p><p>A shrewd networker, Negroponte had been a speaker at the first TED conference in 1984; it was at TED that he first met the husband and wife founders of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epsteins-victims-say-search-justice-must-go/\">Wired magazine</url> . Negroponte became the first investor in the magazine, negotiating himself a backpage column to promote himself and the lab's ideas.</p><p>The Lab earned Negroponte the reputation as the \"PT Barnum of science\", in reference to the 19th century American circus owner credited with the aphorism \"there's a sucker born every minute\".</p><p>A short-lived Media Lab in Ireland ended in disaster, the Irish auditor condemning large severance packages, and only 12 worthless patents to show for $40m (\u00a332m).</p><p>Negroponte brushed off the sneers, confident that his declamatory style of futurism was a potent social tool. \"Once you have an impact... you become part of a new elite,\" he said.</p><p>And Wired magazine proved its value to his project. The veteran tech journalist John Dvorak recalls being given a tour of the Media Lab with the publisher Will Hearst, and coming away unimpressed.</p><p>\"It was a big scam from the beginning - I saw everything they were doing, but I didn't see any original thinking going on.\"</p><p>Today Dvorak is more charitable.\u00a0He views Ito as a \"fall guy\" for an academic experiment that has outlived its original purpose.</p><p>Unsubstantiated claims</p><p>The Lab's impressive sounding list of achievements turn out to be much less spectacular on closer examination.</p><p>In a 2016 video, Ito claims the Lab pioneered today's \"wearables\" such as the Fitbit and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epsteins-victims-say-search-justice-must-go/\">Apple Watch</url> .</p><p>But it was the Japanese consumer electronics industry who pioneered this field; you can see a Seiko TV watch on Roger Moore's wrist in the 1983 Bond movie Octopussy.</p><p>Negroponte's One Laptop Per Child initiative, intended to produce a $100 laptop for emerging countries, was the most public flop. On Media Lab's own terms it hardly mattered. Ito was realising Negroponte's dream of a new\u00a0\"elite\".</p><p>Fall guy or not, Ito's reign is under fire for embodying the dubious morals of a technology industry now under much closer scrutiny.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epsteins-victims-say-search-justice-must-go/\">Business Briefing Newsletter REFERRAL (Article)</url></p><p>MIT Media Lab researcher C\u00e9sar Hidalgo called Ito \"a fake scholar building an 'academic' career with blog posts and ghost writers\". His fall was \"much deserved\", Kara Swisher wrote in The New York Times.</p><p>Faced with a China that increasingly innovates rather than copies, the Lab's priorities seem oddly whimsical.</p><p>Under Ito, the Lab chased trends such as cryptocurrencies and a sideways move into indoor agriculture has come up short; one potential job applicant compared it to what the commercial industry had been doing almost 20 years ago.</p><p>\"Those who do engineering have become completely separate from the people who are provided with a platform to pontificate about their future tech visions,\" notes Fentem.</p><p>The Lab's own future may depend more on rebuilding with adult supervision with a more rigorous engineer as director, rather than the whims of zeitgeist-chasing networker.</p><p>It may be time for less talk, more walk.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-56104842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X28-6C01-F021-640T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1446\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 15, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Whether it's the caffeine or natural enthusiasm for the topic that has defined her career, is not fully clear. \"It takes time to work out social rules and social norms, and to decide 'is that a thing you are going to keep using, or is that just a passing fad?' \" she says. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's an area of significant importance right now, with society struggling to cope with the growing role of internet-connected gadgets and the software accessible on them in our lives. Or more accurately, the troubling byproducts of smartphones and social media - political polarisation, the spread of fake news, and as <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating\">Vanity Fair puts it</url>, the Tinder-driven, online \"dating apocalypse\" - to list a few of them. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are not good at working out the periodicity and the impact [of new technologies],\" Bell says. \"So are we due for a correction?\" </p><p>At this point in our interview, a deafening horn from a ship docked at the nearby overseas passenger terminal near Sydney's Circular Quay abruptly sounds, suggesting the answer is yes, we are due for a slowdown in the pace of technological change. After all, there have been long periods of human history where this has occurred.</p><p>Yet Bell, the anthropologist-turned-tech guru, actually thinks we could be on the brink of another era of rapid advances in what technology can do, driven by how we harness and analyse data. It's part of the reason she moved home to Australia.</p><h>Extraordinary career</h><p>The word \"extraordinary\" is used far too liberally in modern journalism but when it comes to Bell's career, there are few more appropriate superlatives. </p><p>The trailblazing social scientist is among the most prominent technologists this nation has produced. Her views on issues such as diversity and inclusion in the workplace - once considered radical - are now mainstream. Her influence on the way we interact with the devices that dominate our lives is significant.</p><p>Described by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/intels-sharpeyed-social-scientist-20140216-ixrwc\">The New York Times as Intel's \"resident intellectual\"</url>, Bell has spent the better part of the past three decades in the US, including an 19-year stint at the $US170 billion chip giant's Oregon campus. </p><p>Nowadays she lives in Canberra.</p><p>It's not the usual destination for leading technology industry figures, but Bell has never followed the usual path. </p><p>She is one of the star recruits of new Australian National University vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt, who is trying to put the university, ranked by the 2018 QS World University Rankings as Australia's finest (and in the world's top 20), at the heart of the national conversation on innovation. </p><h>Economy at a crossroads</h><p>She has returned to Australia at a time when the Australia's economy has reached a crossroads, with many of our biggest companies under siege from the giants of the internet (think Amazon) and belatedly trying to embrace a tech mindset. At a time when human lives are being dominated by machines, and when machines are becoming more human. </p><p>In other words, it's a fascinating time for someone studying, as a press release heralding her appointment put it, \"what it means to be human in a data-driven economy\".</p><p>It's a role that will see her work closely with Data61, the relatively new flagship innovation unit of the CSIRO, and an opportunity she is relishing. \"Oh, it's going to be so good as a researcher,\" she tells AFR Weekend of the era she thinks will unfold. \"But I'm not sure how I feel about it as a human being.\" </p><p>The daughter of prominent anthropologist Diane Bell, Genevieve spent some of her formative years in remote Indigenous communities, an experience that left a permanent imprint on her world view. But Canberra, where her mother was a professor at the ANU, was mainly home. </p><p>     Growing up she was \"always the kid with her head in a book\", which, she adds, \"wasn't necessarily a fun way to grow up in a place that didn't necessarily value that\".</p><p>\"I read my way through every public library I had access to, alphabetically,\" she says. So prodigious was her reading intake, the Lyneham High School library had to place a limit on the number of books she could borrow. \"Otherwise I would take a whole shelf home with me.\"</p><h>Prime ministerial ambitions</h><p>A precocious teenager, Bell somehow found herself on the typical Canberra trajectory, destined for a career in government.     \"It's embarrassing. I wanted to be prime minister,\" she recounts. \"Because I thought if you were prime minister, you could fix everything. I was 16??. That's the thinking you have at that age. I was diligently pursuing it.\"</p><p>So, after finishing high school early, she did what many aspiring Australian prime ministers have done. She was accepted to study arts/law at Sydney University. But Australia's oldest university and its environs, or maybe it was the law, just didn't quite seem right. She deferred and went to work in the public service in Canberra.</p><p>Then, on a visit to a small, women-only liberal arts institution on the outskirts of Philadelphia, where her mother was briefly working, Bell had something of an awakening. </p><p>          \"I remember being in a room with all these women, and they were just ridiculously articulate and elegant, in this beautiful place, and I remember going, 'I don't know what this is but I would like to try it',\" she recounts. \"I just had this moment. It takes a lot to achieve exit velocity from Australia, in a meaningful way. Like, it really does. You have got to get going. I wanted to see how big the world was, and what you can do in it.\"</p><p>Soon after, she left Australia and never looked back.</p><p>Bell enrolled at that liberal arts institution, Bryn Mawr College, and thrived. She left with two degrees in anthropology and an offer to be one of the seven people admitted each year to Stanford's prestigious doctoral program, on a fully funded scholarship.</p><p>     \"It was OK to be just constantly lost in something, and to be always studying. I was such a dork! But it was great. The most intense period of my life. Everyone talked books, everyone talked ideas, everyone argued ideas.\" </p><h>On track for tenure</h><p>At Stanford, she continued to shine. Bell completed her doctoral thesis on the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, a boarding school in rural Pennsylvania for native Americans. She had a book deal based on a dissertation and was on track for tenure at one of the world's most prestigious institutions. </p><p>But this was the late 1990s. Stanford is based right in the beating heart of Silicon Valley. The tech industry was booming. The internet was just beginning to assert itself as a serious force in global capitalism, and society. And so Bell decided to throw the dice again. </p><p>A chance encounter at a bar led her to being pursued by Intel, which was setting up a social science research lab. At the time, the chip giant was led by Andy Grove, a legendary, forward-thinking CEO named Time's Man of the Year in 1997.</p><p>     \"I thought, here is Intel who, as far as I can tell, are building one of the critical technologies of the 21st century, a technology that proposes to disrupt almost everything,\" she says. \"Mum had always been really clear with my brother and me that you need to do work that mattered, and it shouldn't just matter to you.</p><p>\"Another way of putting it is, you had an obligation to make the world a better place. And I remember just looking at the people I had interviewed with at Intel and thinking, 'I don't know that I want you to build the world without me. I think I'd like in'.\"</p><p>For someone with academic blood in her veins, it was an unusual step. \"My supervisor said he would never speak to me again. He couldn't believe I could waste myself like this. It was not a very popular move.\"</p><p>But it has paid off. </p><h>Witness to the rise of the internet</h><p>At Intel, Bell led a team of engineers, designers and social scientists studying how humans interact with machines. Her stint at the chipmaker encompassed a period during which the internet (and the machines we use to access it) became the dominant forces in society and commerce. </p><p>\"     I watched the internet grow up and I watched device categories that didn't exist take off. I am sometimes stunned that I got to witness that,\" she says. And with artificial intelligence, we may be on the brink of another period like that. </p><p>\"I think we are at the beginning of the next one of those [eras]\" she says. \"The capture, curation and circulation and sense-making of data is the next stage of tech. It's not about the stuff any more, it's about making the stuff do things.\"</p><p>At Intel, Bell also was a champion of diversity and equality in the workplace. Despite being a progressive place with a comparatively progressive culture (Bell got the job at Intel despite declaring she was a radical feminist and unreconstructed neo-Marxist), there are still deeply troubling aspects of Silicon Valley culture which is becoming mainstream business culture.  </p><p>     \"Did I experience sexism? Oh, God yes,\" she says.     \"I was routinely the only woman in the room. And there were moments when people did look at me and go, 'You have a PhD? And yet you are a girl?' \" </p><p>But worryingly, Bell thinks that in some ways the culture problems in big tech companies have deteriorated. You only need to look at a company like Uber for proof. </p><p>     \"There was a hyper-masculinity in Silicon Valley that over the past 20 years has increased, not decreased,\" she says. </p><h>Silicon Valley goes mainstream</h><p>This might be partially explained by the reality that while Silicon Valley was once the rebel child of corporate America, it is now the establishment. \"Money followed, and power followed, and some of those same people who wanted to change the world wanted to run it,\" she explains. </p><p>There is also a tone deafness in the technology industry about the role the industry is playing in job displacement and under-employment, a factor which arguably helped fuel the rise of Trumpism. </p><p>\"I think it's sometimes really easy to forget the rest of the world exists,\" says Bell. \"Silicon Valley is so compelling, and so runs on its own logic. It's so easy to be seduced by it. People are so full of energy and ideas and conversations, and it's really easy to think that's 'the world'.\"</p><p>In comments that will resonate with anyone who has had much exposure to the technology industry, she says: \"One of the challenges is, how do you run a critique of [Silicon Valley] without sounding like you are anti-progress? How do you run a critique of that without sounding like you dislike innovation?\"</p><p>Bell, a technologist after all, does not share the dystopian fears being espoused by many about the rising power of technology, and the firms that own and operate it. </p><p>Humans have been through this before, she says, pointing to the examples of electricity and television. There was similar angst about the latter's impact on society, and not even very long ago. \"Was it going to make us into Americans? Is it good for our kids? That technology is 70 years old and we are still bedding it down inside our culture. We still rearrange our furniture around screens. And it took regulatory moves, second-wave kids, all kinds of stuff for get that sorted.</p><p>Who knows, it may take us this long to properly adjust to the internet, and the devices we use to connect to it. After all, Facebook is only 13 years old, the iPhone is even younger. </p><p>     \"It's easy to forget this at most of this is really new,\" she says. \"Society usually takes a bit longer to catch up.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1022235356</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NVR-5561-JBJ7-N1F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1910\"/><timeReceived>08:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It's how we got where we are today. Changes in the external environment create changes in many parts of the body, including the brain. Here's the lead from a new study that focuses on how the internet affects neural functioning. 'An international team of researchers from Western Sydney University, Harvard University, Kings College, Oxford University and University of Manchester have found the Internet can produce both acute and sustained alterations in specific areas of cognition, which may reflect changes in the brain, affecting our attentional capacities, memory processes, and social interactions,' according to Science Daily[3]. The full study was published recently by the journal World Psychiatry[4]. 'The key findings of this report are that high levels of Internet use could indeed impact on many functions of the brain. For example, the limitless stream of prompts and notifications from the Internet encourages us towards constantly holding a divided attention \u2014 which then in turn may decrease our capacity for maintaining concentration on a single task,' says Joseph Firth, senior research fellow at the NICM Health Research Institute of Western Sydney University, who lead the research. 'Additionally, the online world now presents us with a uniquely large and constantly-accessible resource for facts and information, which is never more than a few taps and swipes away. Given we now have most of the world's factual information literally at our fingertips, this appears to have the potential to begin changing the ways in which we store, and even value, facts and knowledge in society, and in the brain.' Professor Jerome Sarris is the director of research at NICM Health Research Institute and lead author of the report. He is concerned about some of the potential impacts of increasing internet use on the brain. 'The bombardment of stimuli via the Internet, and the resultant divided attention commonly experienced, presents a range of concerns. I believe that this, along with the increasing Instagramification of society, has the ability to alter both the structure and functioning of the brain, while potentially also altering our social fabric. Co-author Dr. John Torous is the director of the digital psychiatry program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School. He says, 'The findings from this paper highlight how much more we have to learn about the impact of our digital world on mental health and brain health. There are certainly new potential benefits for some aspects of health, but we need to balance them against potential risks.' Oxford research fellow and study co-author Dr. Josh Firth (no relation to Joseph Firth, so far as we know) has this comment on the study. 'It's clear the internet has drastically altered the opportunity for social interactions, and the contexts within which social relationships can take place. So, it's now critical to understand the potential for the online world to actually alter our social functioning, and determine which aspects of our social behavior will change and which won't.' The researchers recommend \u2014 wait for it \u2014 further research to identify precisely what changes occur in our brains with increased internet use.Breaking Up Big Tech      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cleantechnica.com/files/2014/11/contactlensled-e1417200327235.jpg\">https://cleantechnica.com/files/2014/11/contactlensled-e1417200327235.jpg</url> History does seem to repeat itself. A century ago, the railroads and oil companies ran roughshod over the American economy. Their behavior finally became so egregious that antitrust legislation was required to limit the worst of their abuses. Now it is big tech's turn. The Congress has suddenly developed a keen interest in breaking up companies like Facebook and Google and replacing them with smaller entities that would compete with one another.If that sounds like a reprise of breaking up the phone company, that's because it is. Kara Swisher, editor-at-large for Recode[5], the technology news website, has an interesting piece in the New York Times[6] in which she urges Congress to do its job, but not to conduct a full frontal assault on the tech industry. She says intelligent regulation would have been easy to do a decade or so ago, but because politicians really don't understand new technology, they abdicated their responsibility. Now the task is infinitely more difficult. 'Look, I strongly support the need to regulate tech and put up solid guardrails,' she says, 'especially since the sector has had pretty much no oversight ever. So far, there has been only self-interested self-regulation that looks like a mishmash of reactive and haphazard decisions by executives who seem to remain ignorant of human nature. These are people who still don't get the fact that neo-Nazis are not just nice guys who want to use their platforms to chat about the best tiki torches and how to get your whites whiter.' But she worries that 'Justice Department investigations could be the harbinger of a disorganized and possibly draconian crusade that could reduce this industry, one of our national treasures, to a pile of rubble. If regulators had applied some pointed pressure only a decade ago, when all the same warning signs were there, we could have prevented the mess we find ourselves in now, with rampant disinformation, egregious privacy breaches and in-plain-sight addictive elements built right into the medium. Was Uber's follow-no-rules approach not enough of a clue that the 'move fast and break things' mentality that pervaded tech was a problem?' she asks. Instead of taking a sledgehammer to tech industries, Swisher counsels some intelligent rules to protect citizens now and in the future. While the recent interest in dismantling these giant companies is robust, 'In other ways the regulators are being too feeble,' Swisher says. 'Sure, the endless grabbing of data by tech companies is offensive. But our government not even trying to pass a national privacy bill to protect users is more so. 'Instead of just reacting, we need our government to be creatively proactive. Regulators should be thinking about how to use federal incentives to spur small business creation to bring meaningful jobs and new innovations to this country; how to persuade investors to spread more venture capital beyond the three states (California, Massachusetts and New York) that get most of it; how to push for a more diverse work force and fund ambitious education programs.' Legislators need to consider 'how to anticipate the human impact of the next group of technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced robotics; how to create the most forward-thinking infrastructure plan to modernize our cities; and how to encourage tech to focus on innovations to combat existential issues like climate change, and food and water shortages.' In other words, government should govern, wisely, honestly, and fairly, just like the umpires who call balls and strikes in baseball or the referees who keep 350 lb linemen from crushing the legs of quarterbacks in football. What Swisher fails to realize is the very changes the internet has wrought in the brains of humans have affected legislators and regulators as well. The technology that allows foreign governments to influence elections in the US also makes it harder for the umpires and referees of society to function effectively. The torrent of information available today is not bringing us together, it is driving us further apart. Google and Facebook are making billions by separating us into enclaves that only permit data we have pre-approved to penetrate. The most dangerous aspect of the internet is not distraction, it is enabling the decline in reasonable debate by separating us all into walled communities where all contrary opinions are banned. The tech companies need competition, surely. Facebook shouldn't be allowed to simply buy up competitors so it can rule the vast majority of the social media universe. But ideas need competition as well. The internet has not set information free, it has made it a prisoner. What regulators and lawmakers need to do is empower the free exchange of information. Just breaking tech companies into smaller, discrete units will not serve the best interests of society.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cleantechnica.com/cleantechnica-newsletters\">https://cleantechnica.com/cleantechnica-newsletters</url>/ Tags: antitrust legislation[7], brain research[8], breaking up tech companies[9], internet[10], Kara Swisher[11]  About the Author       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cleantechnica.com/author/stephenhanley/\">https://cleantechnica.com/author/stephenhanley/</url>  Steve Hanley[12] Steve writes about the interface between technology and sustainability from his home in Rhode Island and anywhere else the Singularity may lead him.

They stand accused of all manner of abuse of power, but mainly (1) using their immense market presence to squeeze competitors and (2) tapping their vast databases to shape Americans' political, cultural and economic behavior. The presumption, shared by Congress and much of the public, which has a long-standing suspicion of power and bigness, is that dealing with the antitrust issues is tantamount to confronting the threats posed by the internet. But it isn't. The real threat is the possibility of a mass cyberattack on the nation's information infrastructure. The internet fundamentally is a national security problem, which is different from saying it has too much market power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When I wrote above that \"it's the technology, stupid,\" I wasn't trying to be cute. What I meant is that the chief culprit is the nature of the technology itself, not the market power of the top internet firms.</p><p> For argument's sake, let's assume that Congress or the White House decides to break up Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google into three companies each. I am not saying this is desirable or undesirable, but it surely would transform the structure. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) What it would not do is make the world a safer place.

Some cyber experts minimize the possibility.</p><p> This is worth repeating: Despite many breaches, none has yet risen to the level of a concerted assault designed to bring daily life to a halt. But the experts also could be wrong. It might be that a mass attack on the United States or some other major target is just a matter of time. What would such an attack look like and feel like? We now have a crude standard of comparison: the coronavirus pandemic, and the subsequent shutdown of major parts of the economy and society.</p><p> The consequences of a massive cyberattack could make the disruptions caused by the pandemic seem like child's play. There might be simultaneous assaults on the nation's power, communication, financial and transportation networks. People would stumble about in a cyber fog with public and private communications channels, from email to cable TV, disabled or overwhelmed.</p><p> We are fooling ourselves if we think that breaking up the industry means we are confronting the true threat of the internet. I have written before that we'd be better off without the internet - a suggestion that some regarded as a silly attempt at humor but, though unrealistic, was an attempt to emphasize the seriousness of the matter.</p><p> My view, then and now, is that all the wonderful things that the internet allows us to do potentially are offset by the possible costs that it could impose on us. If the industry deserves harsh criticism - and it does - it is for downplaying or ignoring the threats posed by this novel and nerve-racking new technology.</p><p> Just what should we be doing now to protect ourselves? The choices aren't good. Switch more and more cyber traffic to private networks? Build some sort of cyber wall to filter out more unwanted traffic? All the possibilities come with high costs and many practical problems.</p><p> But none is likely until we acknowledge the true nature of our problem. Congress seems a long way from doing that. The congressional appearance of the Big Tech executives gave some indication of the gap. Most Democratic members and some Republicans were having too much fun beating up Big Tech.

They stand accused of all manner of abuse of power, but mainly (1) using their immense market presence to squeeze competitors and (2) tapping their vast databases to shape Americans' political, cultural and economic behavior. The presumption, shared by Congress and much of the public, which has a long-standing suspicion of power and bigness, is that dealing with the antitrust issues is tantamount to confronting the threats posed by the internet. But it isn't. The real threat is the possibility of a mass cyberattack on the nation's information infrastructure. The internet fundamentally is a national security problem, which is different from saying it has too much market power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When I wrote above that \"it's the technology, stupid,\" I wasn't trying to be cute. What I meant is that the chief culprit is the nature of the technology itself, not the market power of the top internet firms.</p><p> For argument's sake, let's assume that Congress or the White House decides to break up Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google into three companies each. I am not saying this is desirable or undesirable, but it surely would transform the structure. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) What it would not do is make the world a safer place. Paradoxically, it might make it harder for governments to monitor and regulate the top firms.</p><p> To be fair, let's note that no country has yet suffered a mass cyberattack from a nation or a rogue group that targeted its basic information infrastructure, with the possible exception of Ukraine, attacked by Russia in 2014. Some cyber experts minimize the possibility.</p><p> This is worth repeating: Despite many breaches, none has yet risen to the level of a concerted assault designed to bring daily life to a halt. But the experts also could be wrong. It might be that a mass attack on the United States or some other major target is just a matter of time. What would such an attack look like and feel like? We now have a crude standard of comparison: the coronavirus pandemic, and the subsequent shutdown of major parts of the economy and society.</p><p> The consequences of a massive cyberattack could make the disruptions caused by the pandemic seem like child's play. There might be simultaneous assaults on the nation's power, communication, financial and transportation networks. People would stumble about in a cyber fog with public and private communications channels, from email to cable TV, disabled or overwhelmed.</p><p> We are fooling ourselves if we think that breaking up the industry means we are confronting the true threat of the internet. I have written before that we'd be better off without the internet - a suggestion that some regarded as a silly attempt at humor but, though unrealistic, was an attempt to emphasize the seriousness of the matter.</p><p> My view, then and now, is that all the wonderful things that the internet allows us to do potentially are offset by the possible costs that it could impose on us. If the industry deserves harsh criticism - and it does - it is for downplaying or ignoring the threats posed by this novel and nerve-racking new technology.</p><p> Just what should we be doing now to protect ourselves? The choices aren't good. Switch more and more cyber traffic to private networks? Build some sort of cyber wall to filter out more unwanted traffic? All the possibilities come with high costs and many practical problems.</p><p> But none is likely until we acknowledge the true nature of our problem. Congress seems a long way from doing that. The congressional appearance of the Big Tech executives gave some indication of the gap. Most Democratic members and some Republicans were having too much fun beating up Big Tech. It's a traditional role, but it now is outdated. We need to catch up with reality.</p><p> \u00a9 2020, The Washington Post</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke via video conference during a July 29 congressional hearing on antitrust issues.

According to CDF figures, over the past few months the sectors that could best be coupled to the digital model have also shown the greatest resilience and while many transfer-dependent sectors, such as tourism, or the operation of a physical space such as retailers or restaurants have been most affected, those companies that provide software services have been the most benefited. <br/>\"Tech are disruptive by nature, so in this context, almost all have the best chance to get the best out of the crisis, they were ready for change. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, FB, Google account for 35% of the entire Dow Jones, we've never seen companies like this ever and that also makes them white for critics and regulators and now they're bigger than ever,\" he said. While Cole warns that it is more likely now to be the right time when the government and regulators can increase antitrust controls for big tech, the executive also warns that he sees a negotiation possible in which tech companies must cede controls but in the long run will continue to grow and seek to connect more citizens, because in that percentage of people who are not online today and their opportunity to , on the one hand, close the digital divide and on the other continue to grow. <br/>\"For example, the only way for Facebook to grow is to keep trying to connect the rest of the world, whether connectivity is done by the government or through private public partnerships, closing the digital divide can be a beneficial model for everyone. Just as the phone was the worst restaceous line like the phone now this emergency line, salvation is the internet without a doubt,\" Cole concluded. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-14167450</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RH-D9M1-JBJN-M3FY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;

The Internet is certainly used for all sorts of horrible things, but it has also allowed ordinary people to communicate on a mass scale that would have been unimaginable decades ago. In the old days, if you wanted to reach large audiences of people with your information you always had to go through corporate gatekeepers. </p><p>But today, anyone with an Internet connection can literally broadcast whatever they want to say to the whole world. Personally, my wife and I have always been amazed at how many people we are able to touch all over the planet from our little home in the mountains. Over the past seven years our websites have been viewed more than 100 million times, and we receive emails about our work from people all over the globe. Unfortunately, major changes may soon be coming to the Internet. The election of Donald Trump really angered the elite, and they are blaming the power of the Internet for his victory. They insist that something must be done 'for the good of democracy'. For example, in an opinion piece for the Guardian[1], U.S. Senator <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>proposed that it is time for the U.S. government to step in because Google, Facebookand Twitter have failed to prevent the spread of propaganda, misinformation, and hate speech[2] As lawmakers grapple with the revelations regarding Russia's manipulation of social media during the 2016 election, many are shocked to learn the outsized role that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives. Not only do they guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but their dominance - specifically in the market of information - now requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy. Last week's hearings demonstrated that these companies may not be up to the challenge that they've created for themselves. In some instances, it seems that they've failed to take commonsense precautions to prevent the spread of propaganda, misinformation, and hate speech. Those are very ominous words. So precisely what would constitute 'propaganda', 'misinformation' or 'hate speech'? When you start regulating speech, you cross a very dangerous line. There is a reason why our founders guaranteed us freedom of speech in the Bill of Rights, because if we don't have the freedom to say what we want then what do we really have left? During the presidential election, there was a lot of talk about Hillary Clinton's health. The mainstream media insisted that she was just fine, and they accused those of us in the alternative media that were questioning her health of engaging in 'propaganda' and 'misinformation'. Well, it turns out that we now know that Clinton's health was so bad that Donna Brazile was actually considering replacing her as the nominee[3], and so it was actually the mainstream media that was putting out 'propaganda' and 'misinformation'. Any effort to institute some sort of 'truth police' would take us significantly down the road to totalitarianism, but apparently that is what Franken wants. In fact, he is openly suggesting that it is time for government regulators to step in[4] Instead of simply trusting the big tech companies to police how their services are being used and abused, Franken suggested that regulators need to step in. Lawmakers should take a closer look at the influence technology plays in the everyday lives of Americans by conducting 'vigorous oversight in the form of investigations and hearings to fully understand current practices and the potential for harm,' the Minnesota senator said. 'I'm hopeful that recent events will encourage regulators, as well as a broader contingent of my colleagues \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 to give this issue the attention it deserves,' he said. So once government regulators begin regulating speech on the Internet, where will it end? Will everything that we do on the Internet have to be evaluated for 'truthiness' before it is allowed to be posted? And who decides what the 'truth' actually is? I am a big believer in the marketplace of ideas. I have always been convinced that if everyone is allowed to openly share what they believe that the truth will win in the end. Of course the elite are scared of the free exchange of ideas, because that gives the people way too much control over their own destiny. Prior to the Internet age, they were always in control of the flow of information in our society[5], but now things have changed dramatically. They desperately want to get control of the Internet, because they want things to go back to the way that they used to be. But we can't allow that to happen, and so we must greatly resist any attempts to regulate speech on the Internet.

According to research, 2018 will see over half of the world's population using the internet. Yet, its creator is unhappy about the outcome.</p><p><br/> In an open letter, the 62-year old inventor, Sir Tim Berners-Lee says his creation has deviated from the path that he had envisioned and blames this on the rampant growth of misinformation on the web. He calls for greater regulation of big tech corporations such as Google, Facebook and Twitter to check their monopolistic strategies.<br/> \"The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.\"<br/> \"The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale. In recent years, we have seen conspiracy theories trend on social media platforms, fake Twitter and Facebook accounts stoke social tensions, external actors interfere in elections, and criminals steal troves of personal data,\" says Lee.<br/> Concentration of power on the web Although Lee saw the internet as a medium of empowerment for the poor global populations, rising concentration of power among a handful of internet companies like Google and Facebook put a dent in his vision. According to him, internet is evolving into a tool for controlling and tracking the masses by stoking social tensions, interfering in elections and giving no regard to personal data.<br/> \"What was once a rich selection of blogs and websites has been compressed under the powerful weight of a few dominant platforms. These online gatekeepers can lock in their power by acquiring smaller rivals, buying up new innovations and hiring the industry's top talent, making it harder for others to compete,\" stated Lee.<br/> Call for a regulatory framework Lee says that all efforts made by large tech corporations to control misinformation and manipulation have been unsuccessful because the online platforms are established to make profits and do not care for the social good. He therefore suggests that today's web infrastructure needs a legal framework. By taking inputs from all demographics of population, the framework would keep the companies in check, so consumer interests are not exploited.<br/> \"The responsibility - and sometimes the burden - of making these decisions falls on companies that have been built to maximize profit more than to maximize social good. A legal or regulatory framework that accounts for social objectives may help ease those tensions. Aligning the incentives of the technology sector with those of users and society at large, will require consulting a diverse group of people from business, government, civil society, academia and the arts.\" added Lee.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOLDR-n10421590</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOLDR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RW0-PJT1-JBYT-H055-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410720</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"455\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cio &amp;

Along with excerpts from a seminal paper in 1936 and a binary representation of his date of birth, the new note contains a quotation from 1949, when only a handful of computers existed in the world. \"This is only a foretaste of what is to come,\" it begins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Turing's remark remains true today. Computers have already changed the world in ways that their inventors could never have imagined. Turing could no more have predicted Instagram celebrities and high-frequency trading than Karl Benz, an automotive pioneer, could have predicted suburbs and strip malls. And that is in a world with tens of billions of computers. If predictions about the IoT are correct, that number could rise a hundred-fold. </p><p>Clues about what is to come can be glimpsed in changes that have already happened. In the quarter of a century since the internet first became a consumer phenomenon, it has upended businesses. Data are the currency of the online world, gathered, analysed, sold and occasionally stolen in a business model that has built some of the world's most valuable companies\u2014but which is attracting increasingly unfriendly scrutiny from governments and regulators, and which its critics decry as \"surveillance capitalism\".</p><p>Ubiquitous computing offers the companies which master it the ability to mine data from the real world in the way that big tech firms now mine them from the virtual one. The result will be a slow-burning revolution of quantifiability in which knowledge that used to be fuzzy or incomplete or even non-existent becomes increasingly precise. That will give rise to what sports coaches call \"marginal gains\". A 10% decrease in costs or a 15% cut in energy use are individually unexciting. Put enough of them together, though, and they will amount to a revolution in productivity. </p><p>This will change how companies operate. In a world in which more things are computerised, more companies will come to resemble computer firms. In expensive, high-tech industries, where the economics of the IoT have made sense for decades, the results of this are already visible. Rolls-Royce, a big British maker of jet engines, launched its \"Power by the Hour\" service in 1962, offering to maintain and repair its engines for a fixed cost per hour. Its digital transformation began in earnest in 2002, built around the ability to do continuous, real-time monitoring of its products. Real-time data mean that the firm's engineers can watch engines wear out as they fly. When something needs fixing, they can arrange for repair teams to be waiting on the ground. The firm's data offer flying tips to pilots that can result in fuel savings worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p>A changing business has meant a changing culture. The firm now hires computer programmers as well as aeronautical engineers. It has an internal software division, called r{+2} Data Labs, which is run like a startup, to look for new ways to turn the flood of data into new businesses. It even plans to remodel parts of its industrial-looking campus, replacing the low brick buildings with the manicured-lawn-and-mirror-glass architecture popular in Silicon Valley. After all, says Andrew Hutson-Smith, the head of r{+2}, \"We're competing with Facebook and Google for staff.\"</p><p>Rolls-Royce is not alone. General Electric, its chief rival in the jet-engine business, offers similar services. As costs falls, the model will spread. At an IoT conference in London earlier this year, companies from TVH, a Belgian firm that makes forklifts and industrial vehicles, to ABB, a Swedish heavy engineering firm, were lining up to describe the benefits of what Alexandra Rehak, an IoT expert at Ovum, a firm of analysts, describes as \"servicisation\". </p><p>If ubiquitous computing will turn companies of things into companies of services, the IoT will transform consumers of things into computer users, with all that implies. Like social networks or email, smart gadgets offer convenience and comfort, at the price of turning everything done with them into fuel for an ever more pervasive data economy. </p><p>Smart televisions already watch the users watching them, sending back data on programme choices and viewing habits; some even monitor background conversation. These data, sold on to advertisers and programme-makers and crunched by machine-learning systems, subsidises the price of the televisions themselves (which explains why non-connected, \"dumb\" televisions have become very difficult to buy). Consent is murky. In 2017 Vizio, an American TV-maker, was fined $2.2m by the Federal Trade Commission after regulators found it was not properly seeking users' permission to harvest and resell information on viewing habits. </p><p>Nor is it just televisions. Smart scales monitor weight and fat percentage, a gold mine for the fitness industry. IRobot, maker of the Roomba line of robot vacuum cleaners, caused a furore in 2017 when it revealed plans to share the maps its products build up of users' homes with Google, Amazon or Apple (it has since said it would not share such data without its users' explicit consent). Gadgets from high-tech locks to new cars come with privacy policies running to thousands of words (see chart). </p><p>Refuseniks might choose not to put such gadgets in their home. But outside, in public places, they will be surveilled anyway. The advertising industry is already experimenting with \"smart\" billboards, which can use cameras and facial-recognition software to assess people's reactions to their contents. Hundreds of American police departments can request access to video recorded by Ring, an Amazon subsidiary that makes camera-equipped doorbells. Internal company emails also show Ring providing suggested talking points for police officers to help them persuade homeowners to buy its products, and to allow their recordings to be shared. The American Civil Liberties Union, a campaigning organisation, complains that the result is a half-private, half-public, murkily regulated video-surveillance network. </p><p>Consumers may discover other downsides. Computerisation allows data to flow from users to companies, but it also allows power and control to flow in the other direction. Most smart-home services require a durable connection to remote servers that can fail without warning. Apple is famously unwilling to allow its customers to have broken iPhones repaired anywhere except in its own shops, going so far as to use software updates to disable replacement touchscreens installed by cheaper third-party fixers. John Deere, an American tractor-maker, has spent four years facing down a rebellion from farmers angry at being subject to similar restrictions. Its products have become so computerised that the firm has argued that farmers no longer own their tractors, but merely purchase a licence to operate them. </p><p>If the IoT continues along these lines, it has the potential to reshape the entire world in Silicon Valley's image. One reading of the  history of the internet is that, for all the hand-wringing about privacy and control, they are dogs that have never truly barked. The rise of surveillance capitalism proves that, in the end, consumers are willing to trade their data for the products and conveniences that it offers. A survey in 2016 by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade body, reported that 65% of IoT users seemed happy to see advertising on their devices, presumably in return for lower prices. </p><p>Another reading, though, is that the business models of the internet established themselves early, at a time when neither regulators nor consumers properly understood the technologies underlying them, and when not even the most avid techies could have predicted all their implications. </p><p>These days, things are different. Blamed for everything from addicted children to nurturing terrorism, Big Tech has lost its Utopian shine. That disillusionment has fed back into gloomy predictions about the IoT. In many ways, that is valuable, for if problems can be foreseen they can be more easily prevented. But if the techno-optimism that infused the 1990s and 2000s now looks naive, the techno-pessimism that is fashionable today can be similarly overdone. Like the original internet, the IoT promises huge benefits. Unlike the original internet, the IoT will mature in an age that has become sceptical about where a connected, computerised future might lead. If it has to earn the trust of its users, it will be the better for it in the long run. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-AK7VBT0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1N-N6V1-DY2R-20P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1455\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

European Patent Office president Ant\u00f3nio Campinos said this year that \u201cdemand for patent protection continues to grow, which means inventors and businesses see Europe as an attractive\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009technology market to innovate.\u201d</p><p>Thanks to Big Tech\u2019s latest inventions showcased by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Google, the way we live, search for things, shop, communicate and even woo each other has changed fundamentally. </p><p>However, as Tanya Aplin, a professor in intellectual property law, points out, \u201cnew technology is being used in extremely efficient ways to flood the online markets and platforms with infringing patented, pirated and counterfeit goods.\u201d Some of this reaches the level of criminality and extends to other online issues such as the distribution of child pornography; terrorist recruitment; promoting hate crimes; and the harnessing and misuse of private data belonging to unsuspecting consumers. </p><p>In response, governments have come up with new regulatory proposals for the internet virtually overnight, in contrast to their traditional hands-off approach to regulation. </p><p>The US President memorandum on combating trafficking in counterfeit and pirated goods, the UK\u2019s internet safety report, the EU directive on copyright in the digital single market and Singapore\u2019s protection from online falsehoods and manipulation act were all produced in an extraordinarily short space of time. </p><p>Regulation goes against the spirit of the creed followed by many internet inventors. The original dreamers of the digital age \u2014 pioneers such as Jon Postel, Tim Berners-Lee and Vinton Cerf \u2014 postulated a free and unfettered cyber world. </p><p>In this glorious environment, information flows freely, the right to know is a given, scientific collaboration is easy, you can express your opinions without censure, and innovation and free competition allow online business to thrive without boundaries or borders. </p><p>So is regulation an effective response to the smart use of technology by malefactors in the digital world? </p><p>The answer lies to some extent in the new inventions and digital tools applied in cyber space. Digital tools used in combination with administrative measures, and based on due process, are possibly the only way to counter the boom in both the volume and velocity of criminal activities online.</p><p>The attempts by courts and legislatures around the world to stem the torrent of criminal online actions have been woefully inadequate. </p><p>The law tends to lag behind commercial and technological development and the courts are playing catch-up as they try to deal with the rapid pace of digital deployment, as foreseen by Moore\u2019s Law with its prediction of exponential growth of computing performance. </p><p>Cyber law expert Alex Urbelis points to examples of universal digital tools including \u201cblocking, filtering, proactive monitoring and domain-name policing, \u201cbad actor\u201d listings, digital authentication via blockchain, use of artificial intelligence to predict malicious activity\u201d, as well as \u201cadministrative measures such as notice and takedown, and notice and stay down\u201d \u2014 court orders to delete online content.</p><p>The effective use of administrative measures in the digital era is exemplified by the speedy and cost-effective procedures specifically set up by the UN\u2019s World Intellectual Property Organisation to deal with cyber squatting \u2014 the wrongful registration or use of an internet domain name \u2014 at a global level. </p><p>The WIPO developed The Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy through an independent panel representing different stakeholders around the world.</p><p>The UDRP has been referred to as a contemporary version of the law merchant \u2014 the customary rules that served in medieval times as the international law of commerce \u2014 for cyber space.</p><p>The internet is by nature global and its problems require a worldwide solution. If we are to address the great digital challenges of our time, we require an international, holistic solution, not unlike the universal collaboration around the fight against climate change. </p><p>Global guidance needs to focus on uniform digital tools and administrative measures inclusive of due process. Purely regional efforts to tackle only local fragments of the internet may very well be counter-productive.</p><p>A type of ius gentium (law of nations), natural law or law merchant, in the form of a universal body of customary rules common to all humankind, must be developed for cyber space. </p><p>Without universal and uniform collaboration to develop common guidelines to deal with infringing activities, we can expect further regulatory discord and magnification of the problems those very regulations seek to address.</p><p>As Sir Tim Berners-Lee points out in a related context, principles of a contract \u2014 a \u201cMagna Carta for the web\u201d \u2014 are urgently required not only to respect users\u2019 rights to privacy and data protection but also to preserve the accessibility and openness of the world wide web.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The writer is founder of Digilabs and professor of practice at the Dickson Poon School of Law, King\u2019s College London</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-e49c39e6967d11e98cfb30c211dcd229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4K-S9R1-DXP9-93XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><timeReceived>4:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN PATENT ORGANISATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They stand accused of all manner of abuse of power, but mainly (1) using their immense market presence to squeeze competitors and (2) tapping their vast databases to shape Americans' political, cultural and economic behavior.</p><p> The presumption, shared by Congress and much of the public, which has a long-standing suspicion of power and bigness, is that dealing with the antitrust issues is tantamount to confronting the threats posed by the Internet. But it isn't. The real threat is the possibility of a mass cyberattack on the nation's information infrastructure. The Internet is fundamentally a national security problem, which is different from saying it has too much market power.</p><p> When I wrote above that \"it's the technology, stupid,\" I wasn't trying to be cute. What I meant is that the chief culprit is the nature of the technology itself, not the market power of the top Internet firms.</p><p> For argument's sake, let's assume that Congress or the White House decides to break up Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google into three companies each. I am not saying this is desirable or undesirable, but it would surely transform the structure. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) What it would not do is make the world a safer place. Paradoxically, it might make it harder for governments to monitor and regulate the top firms. There would be more firms to watch, and smaller firms with fewer resources might actually become more vulnerable to attack.</p><p> To be fair, let's note that no country has yet suffered a mass cyberattack from a nation or a rogue group that targeted its basic information infrastructure, with the possible exception of Ukraine, attacked by Russia in 2014. Some cyber experts minimize the possibility. It strikes them as melodramatic alarmism. Perhaps they are right.</p><p> This is worth repeating: Despite many breaches, none has yet risen to the level of a concerted assault designed to bring daily life to a halt. But the experts could also be wrong. It may be that a mass attack on the United States or some other major target is just a matter of time. What would such an attack look like and feel like? We now have a crude standard of comparison: the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent shutdown of major parts of the economy and society.</p><p> The consequences of a massive cyberattack could make the disruptions caused by the pandemic seem like child's play. There might be simultaneous assaults on the nation's power, communication, financial and transportation networks. People would stumble about in a cyber fog with public and private communications channels, from email to cable TV, disabled or overwhelmed.</p><p> We are fooling ourselves if we think that breaking up the industry means we are confronting the true threat of the Internet. I have written before that we'd be better off without the Internet \u2014 a suggestion that some regarded as a silly attempt at humor but, though unrealistic, was an attempt to emphasize the seriousness of the matter.</p><p> My view, then and now, is that all the wonderful things that the Internet allows us to do are potentially offset by the possible costs that it could impose on us. If the industry deserves harsh criticism \u2014 and it does \u2014 it is for downplaying or ignoring the threats posed by this novel and nerve-racking new technology.</p><p> Just what should we be doing now to protect ourselves? The choices aren't good. Switch more and more cyber-traffic to private networks? Build some sort of cyber-wall to filter out more unwanted traffic? All the possibilities come with high costs and many practical problems.</p><p> But none is likely until we acknowledge the true nature of our problem. Congress seems a long way from doing that. The congressional appearance of the Big Tech executives gave some indication of the gap. Most Democratic members and some Republicans were having too much fun beating up Big Tech. It's a traditional role, but it's now outdated. We need to catch up with reality.</p><p> Robert J. Samuelson writes for the Washington Post.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AKBJNL-6746793</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AKBJNL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H8-RYX1-JBCN-415C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387333</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press Group Ltd.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

They stand accused of all manner of abuse of power, but mainly (1) using their immense market presence to squeeze competitors and (2) tapping their vast databases to shape Americans\u2019 political, cultural and economic behavior. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The presumption, shared by Congress and much of the public, which has a long-standing suspicion of power and bigness, is that dealing with the antitrust issues is tantamount to confronting the threats posed by the Internet. But it isn\u2019t. The real threat is the possibility of a mass cyberattack on the nation\u2019s information infrastructure. The Internet is fundamentally a national security problem, which is different from saying it has too much market power. </p><p>When I wrote above that \u201cit\u2019s the technology, stupid,\u201d I wasn\u2019t trying to be cute. What I meant is that the chief culprit is the nature of the technology itself, not the market power of the top Internet firms. </p><p>For argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s assume that Congress or the White House decides to break up Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google into three companies each. I am not saying this is desirable or undesirable, but it would surely transform the structure. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) What it would not do is make the world a safer place. Paradoxically, it might make it harder for governments to monitor and regulate the top firms. There would be more firms to watch, and smaller firms with fewer resources might actually become more vulnerable to attack. </p><p>To be fair, let\u2019s note that no country has yet suffered a mass cyberattack from a nation or a rogue group that targeted its basic information infrastructure, with the possible exception of Ukraine, attacked by Russia in 2014. Some cyber experts minimize the possibility. It strikes them as melodramatic alarmism. Perhaps they are right. </p><p>This is worth repeating: Despite many breaches, none has yet risen to the level of a concerted assault designed to bring daily life to a halt. But the experts could also be wrong. It may be that a mass attack on the United States or some other major target is just a matter of time. What would such an attack look like and feel like? We now have a crude standard of comparison: the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent shutdown of major parts of the economy and society. </p><p>The consequences of a massive cyberattack could make the disruptions caused by the pandemic seem like child\u2019s play. There might be simultaneous assaults on the nation\u2019s power, communication, financial and transportation networks. People would stumble about in a cyber fog with public and private communications channels, from email to cable TV, disabled or overwhelmed. </p><p>We are fooling ourselves if we think that breaking up the industry means we are confronting the true threat of the Internet. I have written before that we\u2019d be better off without the Internet -- a suggestion that some regarded as a silly attempt at humor but, though unrealistic, was an attempt to emphasize the seriousness of the matter. </p><p>My view, then and now, is that all the wonderful things that the Internet allows us to do are potentially offset by the possible costs that it could impose on us. If the industry deserves harsh criticism -- and it does -- it is for downplaying or ignoring the threats posed by this novel and nerve-racking new technology. </p><p>Just what should we be doing now to protect ourselves? The choices aren\u2019t good. Switch more and more cyber-traffic to private networks? Build some sort of cyber-wall to filter out more unwanted traffic? All the possibilities come with high costs and many practical problems. </p><p>But none is likely until we acknowledge the true nature of our problem. Congress seems a long way from doing that. The congressional appearance of the Big Tech executives gave some indication of the gap. Most Democratic members and some Republicans were having too much fun beating up Big Tech.

Every day, new rules are being written to deal with the crisis. Freedoms are curtailed. Enforcement is heavy-handed. Usual civil-liberties protections, such as rights of appeal, are suspended. By act, if not by word, a state of emergency has been declared. This is not a description of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/coronavirus-national-emergency.html\">the United States</url>, or even       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/hungary-coronavirus-just-excuse/609331/?utm_source=feed\">Hungary</url>. It's the internet during the coronavirus pandemic. We are living under an emergency constitution invoked by Facebook, Google, and other major tech platforms. In normal times, these companies are loath to pass judgment about what's true and what's false. But lately they have been taking unusually bold steps to keep misinformation about COVID-19 from circulating.</p><p><br/>As a matter of public health, these moves are entirely prudent. But as a matter of free speech, the platforms' unconstrained power to change the rules virtually overnight is deeply disconcerting.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/wheres-my-flying-car/603025/?utm_source=feed\">Derek Thompson: The real trouble with Silicon Valley</url>]<br/>As this crisis unfolds, Facebook says it is \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/coronavirus/#combating-misinformation-overview\">limiting misinformation and harmful content</url>\" at an unprecedented level. In       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/\">March alone</url>, it displayed fact-checking warnings on 40 million posts related to the pandemic and took down hundreds of thousands of posts that it said could lead to physical harm. On Thursday, the company went       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/16/facebook-will-alert-people-who-have-interacted-with-coronavirus-misinformation/\">so far as to announce</url> that it will individually alert users who have commented upon, liked, or otherwise reacted to debunked myths about COVID-19. Meanwhile, Twitter's blog post about how it is \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/An-update-on-our-continuity-strategy-during-COVID-19.html\">broadening [its] definition of harm</url>\" contains a long and growing list of types of tweets that the platform is removing. Google says it has \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/covid-19-how-were-continuing-to-help/\">taken down thousands of videos</url>\" to protect people from misinformation. These are all important steps, so why not just applaud and move on?<br/>Mark Zuckerberg has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/covid-19-and-social-media-content-moderation\">justified</url>Facebook's newly hands-on approach on the basis that \"you can't yell fire in a crowded theatre.\" But what constitutes shouting \"fire\"-and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/twitter-facebook-delete-brazil-bolsonaro-maduro-misleading-coronavirus-posts.html\">how far</url> platforms should go in their willingness to intervene-is a matter of significant       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/unmasking-twitter/\">controversy</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/unmasking-twitter/\">.</url><br/>The urgent need for platforms to do something should not stop us from asking questions about the powers these and other titans of the online world have assumed under a state of emergency. The platforms, which operate across national borders, are private companies that generally have the right to pick and choose what they allow on their services. But the awesome nature of this power-the ability to decide what is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/8/6/17655658/alex-jones-facebook-youtube-conspiracy-theories\">hate speech</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-we-learned-bloombergs-online-campaign\">permissible political campaigning</url>, or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/arts/design/instagram-free-the-nipple.html\">too much bare skin</url>-has led to calls for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/facebook-outsources-tough-decisions-speech/598249/?utm_source=feed\">more accountability</url> in the way platforms exercise it. Time and again, Facebook and other platforms have disavowed any role as \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103269806149061\">arbiters of truth</url>,\" and they have laid out ostensibly neutral rules for deciding what to take down, tried to set processes for enforcing them nonarbitrarily, and offered limited right of appeal to users who have been found to violate them. These efforts were evolving into a silent constitution that bound users and the platforms themselves. But now it's been rewritten.<br/>In constitutional-law scholarship, an       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/289_jz567rmk.pdf\">emergency constitution</url> describes an exceptional state of governance that operates during a crisis and enhances the powers of those in charge. About       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Endurance-National-Constitutions-Zachary-Elkins/dp/0521731321\">90 percent</url> of countries have explicit provisions for how to deal with states of emergency. Their form       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://academic.oup.com/icon/article-abstract/16/1/101/4995561\">varies a lot</url>, but typically certain rights and liberties are curtailed, and checks and balances removed, to allow for a more decisive and forceful response to whatever disaster threatens the constitutional order. The ongoing pandemic has, unsurprisingly, triggered the invocation of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/16/how-coronavirus-could-trigger-backslide-freedom-around-world/\">many emergency constitutions</url> around the world, so governments can take exceptional measures to deal with the unfolding public-health crisis. People's privacy, freedom of movement, and freedom of speech are being restricted in ways that would not be accepted in ordinary times.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/why-silicon-valley-and-big-tech-dont-innovate-anymore/604969/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Silicon Valley abandons the culture that made it the envy of the world</url>]<br/>Major tech companies, too, have responded to the pandemic in ways that expose just how much power they can exercise when they decide to do so.<br/>First, many platforms-not just Facebook, Twitter, and Google-have adopted new rules specifically addressing coronavirus-related content. Amazon has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-quietly-removes-coronavirus-books/\">quietly removed</url> dozens of books containing conspiracy theories or medical misinformation. Medium is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219907/medium-coronavirus-covid-19-news-misinformation-conspiracy-theories-best-worst\">aggressively taking down</url> viral posts under a new policy on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045484653-COVID-19-Content-Policy\">COVID-19 content</url>, despite the site's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@ev/welcome-to-medium-9e53ca408c48\">mission</url> to be a platform for \"whatever you have to say.\" Reddit has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/the-mods-behind-the-fastest-growing-covid-19-subreddit\">added</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/the-mods-behind-the-fastest-growing-covid-19-subreddit\">warning messages on two subreddits</url> for boosting misinformation.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/pinterest-is-blocking-coronavirus-searches-and-people-are\">Pinterest</url> is limiting all search results about the coronavirus to those from \"internationally-recognized health organizations.\" Internet companies, in short, are trying to impose guardrails.<br/>Second, enforcement during the state of emergency is swift and blunt. With most human content moderators at home and unable to work remotely for logistical reasons, the major platforms have to rely on their automated tools more than normal.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/coronavirus/#content-review\">Facebook</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/An-update-on-our-continuity-strategy-during-COVID-19.html\">Twitter</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2020/03/protecting-our-extended-workforce-and.html\">YouTube</url> all acknowledged that they would make more mistakes as a result. In other words, they would remove speech that should stay up. This speech becomes collateral damage in the mobilization around the pandemic, and a concession to the exigencies of the moment. With misinformation a potential matter of life and death, and simply no way of having humans review every post, the choice between blunt tools and no moderation at all is simple.<br/>Even the usually sacred principle that platforms will not interfere with the speech of political figures has been abandoned. After Twitter       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199845/twitter-tweets-brazil-venezuela-presidents-covid-19-coronavirus-jair-bolsonaro-maduro\">removed tweets</url> from the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for violating its policies by tweeting false or misleading information about COVID-19 cures, Facebook and YouTube       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-31/facebook-twitter-pull-misleading-posts-from-brazil-s-bolsonaro\">quickly followed</url>. For a tech platform to suppress statements by a democratically elected leader is a truly remarkable step-and potentially one that makes it harder for voters to hold their representatives accountable in the future.<br/>Third, even with these sweeping new rules and blunter enforcement, platforms have been suspending their usual due-process protections. Being muted by an algorithm on Facebook or YouTube may have no legal consequence-unlike, say, being silenced by police in the public square. Still, the former is a much greater hindrance than the latter is on a person's ability to connect with an audience, especially at a moment of social distancing. Nevertheless, without as many human content moderators on deck, the major platforms have all scaled back their appeals processes for people who feel their posts were taken down incorrectly.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/?utm_source=feed\">Read: How the pandemic will end</url>]<br/>The platforms are revealing their far-reaching power in other ways. For some time before the pandemic, members of Congress and regulators around the world had been attacking major internet companies over their data-collection and data-sharing practices. Yet in recent weeks, Facebook and Google have presented their troves of hyper-detailed data as a boon to disease researchers and have unveiled new products that employ user information to help document the pandemic's spread and organize response efforts. As the tech journalist Casey Newton       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/7/21209595/google-mobility-reports-facebook-disease-prevention-maps-tech-privacy-backlash\">wrote recently</url>, \"Big tech companies, which have spent the past three years on the defensive over their data collection practices, are now promoting them.\"<br/>If ever an emergency justified a clampdown on misinformation and other extraordinary measures, the coronavirus pandemic is surely it. The tech companies' swift action in the current crisis has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-has-the-coronavirus-killed-the-techlash/\">been</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/media/coronavirus-facebook-twitter-social-media.html\">widely</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/26/21193902/tech-backlash-covid-19-coronavirus-google-facebook-amazon\">praised</url>, and so it should be. But this still leaves very real questions. Unlike most countries' emergency constitutions, those of major platforms have no checks or constraints. Are these emergency powers temporary? Will there be any oversight to ensure these powers are being exercised proportionately and even-handedly? Are data being collected to assess the effectiveness of these measures or their cost to society, and will those data be available to independent researchers? The question is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/28/facebook-twitter-amazon-misinformation-coronavirus/\">already</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/media/coronavirus-facebook-twitter-social-media.html\">being</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/March-18-2020-Press-Call-Transcript.pdf\">asked</url> whether things should ever go back to \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/lies-about-covid-19-might-be-deadly-but-theyre-not-unique/\">normal</url>\"-or whether this more iron-fisted rule is what the internet needed all along. The favorable news coverage that platforms are receiving will no doubt make similar heavy-handedness more tempting in the future-and in circumstances far less dire than a global pandemic.<br/>Users have no way of forcing platforms to answer any of these concerns. Indeed, the state of emergency throws into sharp relief what is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/covid-19-and-social-media-content-moderation\">always true</url> about the majority of regulation of online speech: the powers of rule making, enforcement, and review are all concentrated in the same hands. What's happening during the pandemic is just an accentuated version of the norm. It has shown that even the most seemingly entrenched rules can be instantly overthrown. Right now, this may be helpful. But what about once the worst of this crisis subsides?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-pandemicfacebookandtwittergrabmorepower610213</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPH-XD61-JCG7-V002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1570\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Lube was bought by the drum and hidden in bunkers, alongside vibrators and air-gapped computers holding valuable troves of accurate, non judgemental sex information. Gimp suits were stored upright, oiled, and ready for doomsday's call. Explicit gifs became a black market commodity, and there were rumors of a Thunderdome ruled by cam girls. </p><p>Every sexual identity, except the singular one deemed safe by the corporations, went into hiding. Fear prevented even the mere mention of sexual pleasure on the networks and in communications.Don't laugh: your phone may transcribe it incorrectly and include \"sexual slang\" which this week was made \"illegal\" on Facebook[1] \u2014 along with all forms of sexual speech and expression. (\"Free speech, my ass.\" - Everyone.)While we were all distracted by the moist dumpster fire of Tumblr announcing[2] its porn ban, Facebook updated its startling, wide-ranging anti-sex policy that is surely making evangelicals and incels cream their jeans (let's just hope they don't post about that). Facebook's astonishing ban on language pertaining to sexuality, among many other things sex-related, is so sweeping and egregiously censorious that it's impossible to list all its insanity concisely.It's called the \"Sexual Solicitation[3]\" policy. Along with \"sexual slang,\" the world's standard-bearing social media company is policing and banning \"sex chat or conversations,\" \"mentioning sexual roles, sexual preference, commonly sexualized areas of the body\" and more.When reached for comment, a Facebook spokesperson told Engadget via email that \"most of the sexual solicitation policies that you have called out aren't new.\" Facebook explained:On October 15, we added a section entitled, \"Sexual Solicitation\" to our Community Standards. Previously, our sexual solicitation policies were included within Section 8: Sexual Exploitation of Adults and Section 14: Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity (happy to share the relevant parts of those sections pre-October 15, if helpful).This change was prompted, in large part, by conversations with our content reviewers, who told us that the sexual exploitation policy did not adequately distinguish between exploitation (e.g. \"My ex was a slut. Look at the photos she sent me.\") and solicitation (e.g. \"Looking for swingers. Friday at 8 PM, [name of bar]. Wear pink.\"), leading to confusion among reviewers, as well as the perception that we treat sexual exploitation and solicitation the same. We recognize that not all solicitation leads to exploitation.Facebook also referred us to Mark Zuckerberg's published remarks[4] on policy development.According to the policy, public discussion of \"sexual violence and exploitation\" is okay, but anything encouraging sex for pleasure between adults is now a bannable offense in public posts. They don't say anything about private messages, but we know they comb DM's and have a less than transparent approach[5] about it, so maybe watch what you say there, too.First Tumblr bans NSFW imagery, now Facebook bans NSFW *words*!! pic.twitter.com/ozb0nwgEUr[6]\u2014 Vivian (@suchnerve) December 5, 2018[7] If only Facebook policed hate speech[8] with the same terrifying and brutal efficiency \u2014 though I think we all know by now what gods Facebook sacrifices to, and who Facebook serves when they claim an action is taken for \"community safety[9].\" In other words, Holocaust deniers[10] and inbred racial purists of every social strata still have their safe space.Yet, like I said, the shiny happy darknet that has made a science of sexual censorship was just one of two internet giants to take extreme measures to eliminate sane human sexual expression from the public internet this week.Tumblr's announcement to remove and forbid sexual content revved the dark promise of FOSTA's legalization of sex censorship[11] and drove it off a cliff. Tumblr announced Monday[12] that on December 17, all adult content will be banned and excised from the service.When I reported[13] on Tumblr's last attempt to disappear sexual expression in 2013, back when it was Yahoo's fixer-upper, that affected an estimated 12.5 million blogs. Considering that Tumblr use peaked in 2014, that number is certainly higher.So we're talking about a kind of cultural genocide on the open internet, one comprised of women, LGBTQI people, artists, educators, bloggers, filmmakers, sex workers, abuse survivors, untold communities[14], and tons and tons of photographers and models. For me, Tumblr was the only place to find the blogs of Black erotic photographers, whose empowering work is arguably more needed in the world than ever. This rich collection of humanity and community[15] living authentically and unashamedly in the quest for life-affirming sex-positivity will be snuffed out, at infancy, in ten days. (\"They're ignoring my safeword!\" -George Orwell, probably.)Hey \u2014 don't knock my Orwell joke. In 1984, the junior Anti-Sex League was a pro-celibacy group that acknowledged the necessity of standard sexual procreation. It pushed the agenda of the Party, which was to[16] \"make sure people are in marriages that are planned to be unsatisfying and that sex is vilified.\" Et tu[17], Silicon Valley?Anyway. Like it did the last time Tumblr went all Republic of Gilead[18] on sex, the internet lost its mind[19] upon hearing Monday's announcement. Tumblr handled the news abysmally[20], and immediately implemented its automated censorship flagging system so badly[21], that many of us rushed to double-check that Marissa Mayer wasn't still in charge. (Tumblr is now part of Verizon, which also owns Oath/Engadget, and may[22] still control shares in Ajit Pai).Tumblr told Engadget via email that \"machine classifiers, in general, take time\" and that \"time improves their performance,\" and reminded us that \"flagged content is not being deleted, rather set to private such that it's viewable only to the owner of that content.\"Some of my photos flagged as explicit by tumblr's new algorithm. I would say I'm impressed with how bad it is, but... Yeah this was about what I expected#RipTumblr pic.twitter.com/BF5xQx3xo0[23];\u2014 naye (@unnaye) December 4, 2018[24] When reached for comment as to why, Tumblr referred us to its blog post's generic statement[25] about making a \"safe place for creative expression\" and \"impact across different age groups, demographics, cultures, and mindsets.\" Further, the company stressed that the policy has not yet been enforced, as per its statement.So, since that's what they all say, it's probable no one really knows why Tumblr is doing this; FOSTA has been blamed[26], and so has Apple's app store gatekeeping practices[27]. Rightly so, because Apple's role in censoring and suppressing sexual speech is longstanding, and so vile and insidious[28] that it'll make you rage-smash an iPhone if you take it all in at once.But the arc of internet sex censorship is long, and it bends as far away from justice (and reason) as possible. Corporations controlling the internet had been steadily (and sneakily, hypocritically) moving this direction all along, at great expense to women, LGBT people, artists, educators, writers, and marginalized communities \u2014 and to the delight of bigots and conservatives everywhere.The Facebook and Tumblr news came after Starbucks announced[29] it will start filtering its WiFi with one of those secret porn blacklists that always screw productivity for anyone researching grown-up topics, and invariably filter out crucial health and culture websites.The list goes on. Instagram goose-steps[30] for Facebook's censors; Amazon buries sex books[31]; Patreon[32], Cloudflare[33], PayPal, and Square[34] are among many which are tacitly unsafe for anyone whose business comes near sexuality. Google's sex censorship timeline[35] is bad, YouTube is worse[36]. Twitter teeters[37] on the edge of sex censorship amidst its many uncertainties of trust for its users.So, if you like big brands, advertisers, and white supremacists, it appears the corporate internet has you covered.One thing is true: people loved the open internet when it was a) not under corporate stewardship hearkening back to 1950s values, and b) you could find people doing all kinds of sex in its different corners. Erasing millions of sex blogs and repressing sexual speech like Goebbels is the sign of a sick ecosystem, the opposite of a future-facing business plan and ignorant of millions of people who disagree wholeheartedly.Tumblr says[38] they're erasing a million-plus blogs and decimating communities to create a \"better, more positive\" experience; Facebook, as usual, claims[39] to be \"encouraging expression and creating a safe environment.\"I don't think any company that actively erases positive sexual expression is going to wake up to the fact that what they're doing is regressive at best and harmful at worst. When given the opportunity to revert these policies, like if FOSTA was dumped, it's clear none of them would. After all, FOSTA with all it's ignoring of women and conflating of sex work with rape, was a bipartisan bill[40] -- and its most pivotal supporter was Facebook[41].But please don't fret. Stay sexy and sharp, because is anything is certain it's this: They will all become MySpace eventually.

On both points we need to be a little more creative,' he said.</p><p>'I want the web to reflect our hopes and fulfil our dreams, rather than magnify our fears and deepen our divisions.'</p><p><person><nameText>Berners-Lee </nameText></person>is widely considered as one of the founding fathers of the internet.</p><p>In 1989 he published his landmark paper, 'Information Management: A Proposal', built the first WWW server and web browser 'WorldWideWeb.app'.\u00a0</p><p>When he first dreamt up his information sharing model, the British computer scientist envisioned it as a free platform for collaboration and the exchange of ideas.\u00a0</p><p>Since the mid-90s <person><nameText>Berners-Lee </nameText></person>has used his platform to fight for greater internet accessibility worldwide and to challenge what he perceives as obstacles to his original vision for the web.</p><p>In November 2017, the 62-year-old warned 'the system is failing' when it comes to the internet, and that\u00a0the future of open online communication is under threat.\u00a0</p><p>In an in-depth interview with The Guardian,\u00a0Berners-Lee explained that he feels his creation is being used to spread misinformation and to polarise debate.</p><p>Advertising platforms and AI algorithms used by big firms like Facebook and Google can be used by third parties with ulterior motives to spread propaganda, for political or financial gain.</p><p>High profile cases have included attempts by\u00a0Russian operatives to influence the outcome of elections in the US, and a group of Macedonian teenagers who spread political clickbait fake news on Facebook to cash in on Google's AdSense revenues.</p><p>Speaking to The Guardian, he said: 'The system is failing. The way ad revenue works with clickbait is not fulfilling the goal of helping humanity promote truth and democracy, so I am concerned.</p><p>'People are being distorted by very finely trained AIs that figure out how to distract them.</p><p>'We are so used to these systems being manipulated that people just think that's how the internet works. We need to think about what it should be like.'\u00a0</p><p>Also under fire are attempts to remove net\u00a0neutrality protections.</p><p>Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic should be be treated equally.</p><p>Whether you're trying to buy a necklace on Etsy, stream a series on Netflix, or upload a photo to Facebook, your internet service provider has to load all of those websites equally quickly.</p><p>If net neutrality is lost, internet service providers (ISPs) could create special 'fast lanes' for content providers willing to pay more.\u00a0</p><p>Customers of streaming services like Netflix could see their subscription fees rise if the company chooses to pay more.</p><p>More than 170 internet giants including Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Google  and PornHub, have protested against plans by US officials to remove rules protecting net neutrality.</p><p>The US communications regulator, the FCC, earlier this year voted to remove a 2015 ruling that put net neutrality into law by preventing the 'throttling' of data by ISPs.</p><p>Giving powerful gatekeepers the ability to select who has priority access to the internet threatens to stifle innovation and free speech, Berners Lee believes.</p><p>He feels that ISPs should be treated more like utilities companies.</p><p>'Gas is a utility, so is clean water, and connectivity should be too,' he added. 'It's part of life and shouldn't have an attitude about what you use it for - just like water.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-42201327</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RVJ-N4Y1-JCJY-G4DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><timeReceived>8:41 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Real governments struggle to tame the beast in areas ranging from privacy and democracy to taxation and corporate clout. Facebook even has plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, called Libra.</p><p> Finally, though, there are signs governments are stirring themselves to meet the challenge \u2014 and not a moment too soon.</p><p> In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a record fine of $5 billion last week for misleading its users about the privacy of their personal information. In addition, the FTC ordered the company to set up a new board-level committee on privacy and make its data practices more transparent.</p><p> That's a lot of money. But for Facebook, even a fine of that size is just the cost of doing business. It earned more than that in the last quarter alone and its stocked jumped 56 percent last year while it weathered a storm of criticism.</p><p> The bigger potential challenge to Facebook and the rest comes from another direction. After years of leaving the big tech firms to pretty much regulate themselves, the U.S. government has launched investigations into how they have amassed so much market power and whether they've violated antitrust laws.</p><p> This is a big change. So far the tech companies have faced their biggest push-back in Europe while Washington tended to defend them as champions of innovation. But now the U.S. Justice Department and federal regulators are lining up Facebook et al in their sights.</p><p> And it isn't just about privacy, \"fake news\" and similar well-publicized concerns about social media and the health of democracy. Those are important, but the real stakes for the dominant tech companies lie in a challenge to the enormous market power they have accumulated in just a few years.</p><p> An antitrust review could put into question that power, the near-monopoly grip on key markets that lets them dominate billions of dollars in advertising revenue, squeeze out potential competitors, dictate terms of business, and avoid paying tax in many of the places they operate. Even breaking up some of the biggest companies would be a real possibility \u2014 especially if a Democrat wins the White House next year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKSD-ffc5a32e83a6526a497c7fe211f37842ed96bfb7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D5F9E2A5D269 NWBKSD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPX-KXF1-DXVP-V2PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409759</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Rapid City Journal, 507 Main Street Rapid City, SD<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Introduction</emphasis></h><p>The first paper in this series explored several accounts of the IT revolution. Of particular interest was the contrast between those who framed this process in terms of positive outcomes and those who consider that it has been subverted by powerful actors especially in Silicon Valley. The second paper considered two case studies: the Internet of Things (IoT) and the projected rise of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). It briefly employed Integral concepts to identify values and worldviews that appear to characterise leading figures within the IT industry. These interior human characteristics arguably have powerful consequences yet have been widely overlooked in high-tech environments. It concluded that, on the whole, and notwithstanding some obvious practical gains, there is evidence to support the view that the Internet has been undermined and compromised by the power, wealth and reach of vast monopoly enterprises. Yet the second paper also suggested that multiple solutions, or ways forward, already exist in embryo and many more are sure to emerge. So the third and final paper considers ways of challenging the current status quo, of revising assumptions and re-designing (or re-purposing) the Internet and associated IT applications towards more egalitarian and socially viable ends. These are huge and complex topics that shift and change almost daily. So it should be appreciated that a concise account such as this cannot be other than a work in progress.</p><p>The first section picks up the central theme of the series by focusing on ill-considered or compulsive innovation. It questions fatalistic attitudes and argues that, far from being inevitable, concerns such as artificial intelligence (AI) or Chinese surveillance practices need to be brought more fully into the open and subjected to sustained critical enquiry. The rest of the paper takes up the theme of recovery and renewal. Some critical 'blind spots' are briefly outlined (a distinct lack of interest in global challenges; a pervasive tendency to under-value 'the social') and reframed in more positive terms. The notion of 'constitutive human interests' is raised. It's here that the implications of the project become more obvious since many of the concerns raised can also be viewed as positive opportunities for productive innovation and adaptive change.</p><p>A variety of innovations for better managing IT-related innovations and re-purposing the Internet are subsequently discussed. They include working with three scales of innovation, taming algorithms and supporting human agency. The innovation theme continues in the following chapter where wider questions about social democracy, new infrastructure and regulation are discussed. Finally we return to the question of 're-humanising' the IT revolution. Here the discussion includes notions of the public good, moral universals (and their lack) and the vexed, ever-present question of the sheer ambiguity of unconstrained and rapid technical innovation. The overall conclusions of this paper, and indeed, of the whole project, are framed by a growing imperative to 'disrupt the disruptors' by investing in socially democratic actions and processes across the board. These could include changing the terms of business to rein in the oligarchs, breaking up monopolies (or re-constituting them as public utilities), subjecting proposed high-tech innovations to greater informed scrutiny, building new civic infrastructure and supporting the development of further IT capabilities in the public, as opposed to private, interest.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Compulsive innovation</emphasis></h><p><br/>'You can't stop progress'</p><p>One of the themes that emerges from this enquiry is the need and opportunity for large-scale, democratically mediated social design and a commitment to long-term social innovation in the public interest. At first sight it may appear difficult to see how the motivation for such efforts could arise or from whom. But these are early days and motivation can emerge from a variety of sources. To begin with, in a context of radically ambiguous technical innovation, with its accompanying upheavals and disruptions the widely held, but ultimately fatalistic, view that 'you can't stop progress' clearly lacks credibility and should be set aside. Modifying this slightly to 'you can't stop technical innovation' is a small step forward but doesn't take us very far. Of far greater value is a more nuanced understanding of what terms such as 'progress' and 'innovation' actually mean, what values they spring from, whose interests are represented (or extinguished) and what longer term impacts and consequences may plausibly occur.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0195\"/>Such issues are hardly the stuff of common conversation but if society is to regain any say at all in its own prospects they need to be brought to full awareness and debated much more widely. Similarly, the social, political, technical and environmental consequences of neo-liberal formulas, of economic growth as the primary goal along with ever more extreme inequality are no longer in doubt. They are writ large throughout the world. People are becoming ever more concerned about these issues and, moreover, the Earth system itself is responding to multiple human impacts with glacially slow, but unstoppable, momentum. Notions of 'progress' in this context clearly need to be unpacked as they are fraught with ambiguity and increasingly divorced from genuine human interests (<link><marker>Metcalf, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0195\"/></link>). Australia's Gold Coast illustrates this dilemma rather well. Here an immodest, high-rise 'glitter strip' devoted to pleasure seeking and escapism emerges from the edge of a vast ocean that could - and almost certainly will - overpower it at any time. Viewed from above or from the ocean the hubris inherent in these structures becomes obvious. (<link><marker>Fig. 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60005\"/></link>) All it will take to shatter the illusion is increased beach erosion, the steady rise of sea levels, a strong storm surge or perhaps a wayward cyclone. The mode of development on open display is a living testament to a worldview characterised by profit-seeking, denial and short-termism. These are not characteristics that bode well for the future (<link><marker>Slaughter, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0315\"/></link>).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference60005\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref60005\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr1SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr1LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 1 - High-rise hubris, Gold Coast, Australia.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p><anchor id=\"ref0225\"/>'Progress' is often seen as synonymous with technical innovation but such notions do not withstand close scrutiny. Similarly, a continuing free-for-all dialectic of innovation and counter innovation quickly becomes irrational in our currently divided world. In what may be an inexact but tellingly perverse reversal of Moore's Law the stakes grow ever more extreme with each new level of technical capability. Yet business leaders and decision makers seem largely unaware of this. We can see this in the current breakout of IT company investments in powerful real-world applications such as automation and advanced robotics that look set to destroy most, if not all, semi-skilled jobs (<link><marker>Murphy, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0225\"/></link>). We see it in the irrationality of emerging autonomous weapon systems (<link><marker>Begley &amp; Wroe, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0025\"/></link>). We also see it on the mid-term horizon in the systemic threats that plausibly arise from quantum computing (<link><marker>Majot &amp; Yampolskiy, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0185\"/></link>). A more immediate example is the rise of GPS spoofing. The early development of this technology was undoubtedly useful as it introduced precise, reliable navigation into countless transportation applications. Now certain features in its design are being quite deliberately employed to disable it. According to reports anomalous results were first spotted by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PokemonGo</emphasis> players near sensitive sites in Moscow and then began appearing elsewhere. For example, alarms began to sound when the master of a ship in the Black Sea discovered that his position was over 30\u202fkm away from where it was supposed to be. Russia is thought to be one entity experimenting with the technology. But of equal or perhaps greater concern is that spoofing software can now be downloaded from the Internet and employed by anyone with the knowledge and will to do so (<link><marker>Hambling, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0125\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0365\"/>A similar dialectic is can be seen in countless other examples, sometimes even in advance. Actively scanning the environment for signals of change does, in theory, provide time to respond. Separate scanning hits may interact to reveal previously hidden possibilities. For example, public media announce that trials of driverless 'autonomous vehicles' (AVs) will occur along a public motorway. A UK Minister of Transport announces that AVs will be in use by 2021 (<link><marker>Topham, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0365\"/></link>). Such developments are now becoming technically feasible. Yet around the same time a radical group publishes details about how, with a little imagination, vehicle-derailing devices can be easily and cheaply constructed and set in place leaving those responsible to disappear without trace (<link><marker>Thiessen, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0360\"/></link>). Little imagination is required to suggest that both high-, and low-tech devices will be developed to intervene and disrupt the smooth operation of AV technology wherever it is deployed. Once again we are reminded that new technologies are never 'value free;' they always come with hidden weaknesses and costs, winners and 'losers'. Those who put their faith in complex systems will eventually need to recognise that the latter are not infallible. Those with different values and what one might call 'oppositional' social interests will continue to take advantage of any weaknesses or blind spots (<link><marker>Bartlett, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0020\"/></link>). It follows that the 'hidden', non-material side of any technology is at least as significant as its physical form. It therefore requires much closer attention.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.1. Artificial intelligence</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0035\"/>Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking are among many who have warned of the dangers of artificial intelligence (AI) and the very real possibility that it may represent an existential threat to humanity. Fresh impetus to this debate was provided when Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk clashed over this issue (<link><marker>Biggs, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0035\"/></link>). While Musk echoed previously expressed concerns, Zuckerberg would have none of it. For him such talk was 'negative' and 'irresponsible.' He's dead against any 'call for a slowdown in progress' with AI (<link><marker>Frier, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0095\"/></link>). So it fell to director James Cameron, director of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Terminator 2</emphasis> and other movie blockbusters, to inject some reality into the proceedings by reminding everyone of the mammoth in the room. Namely that it is '<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">market forces</emphasis> (that) have put us into runaway climate change, and the sixth mass extinction.' He then added that 'we don't seem to have any great skill at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> experimenting on ourselves in completely unprecedented ways' (<link><marker>Maddox, 2017, emphases added</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0175\"/></link>).</p><p>What is significant here is that it falls to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a movie director</emphasis> to draw attention to links between the products of an advanced techno-economic system and the growing likelihood of irrational outcomes. Such concerns are fundamental to the maintenance of public safety and wellbeing. Yet, as was pointed out in an earlier paper, careful consideration of the social implications of technical change by public authorities has declined even as the need for it has increased. The race to create artificial intelligence is being pursued in many places. Yet up to this point few of the key players have appeared willing to pull back and rigorously assess the risks or seek guidance from wider constituencies. For East or West to passively 'follow the technology wherever it leads' is technological determinism writ large. It's clearly an inadequate basis upon which to make decisions, let alone to gamble with the future of humanity.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0050\"/>We cannot assume that advanced AI will take over the world and either destroy humanity or render it redundant. Such outcomes are certainly possible but there are genuine differences of opinion on these very questions (<link><marker>Brooks, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0050\"/></link>; <link><marker>Caughill, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0070\"/></link>). Of more immediate concern is that various agencies have been looking to AI for military and security 'solutions' for some years. Roboticised figures have been common in the entertainment industry for several decades (<link><marker>Fig. 2</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60010\"/></link>). But wider appreciation of risks involved in their use in real-world situations has been minimal thus far. Now, however, robot soldiers are being designed and tested. At the time of writing, for example, a group called the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots was meeting at the United Nations in New York. Part of the program included a film illustrating the potential of 'assassin drones' to sweep into a crowded area, identify targets using facial recognition, apply lethal force and vanish. Concerned scientists were attempting to 'highlight the dangers of developing autonomous weapons that can find, track and fire on targets without human supervision' (<link><marker>Sample, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0275\"/></link>). This may sound like science fiction (SF) but a leading AI scientist offered at least two reasons for believing that such devices are closer than one might think. In their view:<br/>The technology illustrated in the film is simply an integration of existing capabilities. It is not science fiction. In fact, it is easier to achieve than self-driving cars, which require far higher standards of performance. (Also) because AI-powered machines are relatively cheap to manufacture, critics fear that autonomous weapons could be mass produced and fall into the hands of rogue nations or terrorists who could use them to suppress populations and wreak havoc (<link><marker>Sample, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0275\"/></link>)<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference60010\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref60010\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr2SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr2LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 2 - Augmented and robot figures as entertainment.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p>This is merely one branch of a rapidly evolving area of research and innovation but the prospects are clearly terrifying. They also raise another key question: who or what locus of authority provided the green light to arms manufacturers, the disruptors of Silicon Valley, or indeed anyone else to carry out these unprecedented experiments? Reinventing the world in a high-tech era - whether by innovation or disruption or both - is a non-trivial matter. To routinely and relentlessly create quite new dangers and hazards cannot do other than threaten the viability of humanity and social life. Yet somehow these entities continue to operate openly and with confidence, yet lacking anything remotely like a social license. Some consider that the development of AI could be <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the</emphasis> test case that decides the matter for once and for all. Here is Taplin again on how what he regards as the benign legacy of Engelbart - an Internet pioneer - was turned toward darker ends. He writes that the latter 'saw the computer as primarily a tool to augment - not replace - human capability'. And yet 'in our current era, by contrast, much of the financing flowing out of Silicon Valley is aimed at building machines that can replace humans' (Taplin, 2017, p. 55). At this point, and to anticipate a theme considered below, the ghost of Habermas might well be heard whispering something along the lines of 'whatever happened to our communicative and emancipatory interests?' To what extent does their absence from dominant technical discourses mean they are also missing from the products and outcomes they produce?</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.2. The panopticon returns</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0385\"/>The original panopticon as envisaged by Jeremy Bentham in the 18th Century was a design for a prison in which all the inmates could be continuously monitored without their knowledge. Since they could never know whether they were being observed or not they were constrained to act as if they were at all times. Hence they became adept at controlling their own behaviour (<link><marker>Wikipedia, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0385\"/></link>). During recent years newer versions have arisen that bring this oppressive model to mind. One is in China; the other much more widely distributed. Chinese intentions to use IT for social control are revealed by Paul Mozur in Shanghai. He writes that:<br/>China's ambitions with AI range from the anodyne to the dystopian, according to the new plan. It calls for support for everything from agriculture and medicine to manufacturing. Yet it also calls for the technology to work in concert with homeland security and surveillance efforts. China wants to integrate AI into guided missiles, use it to track people on closed-circuit cameras, censor the Internet and even predict crimes (<link><marker>Mozur, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0220\"/></link>).</p><p>This may not seem like a particularly significant departure from what's already occurring elsewhere. What is different is that China already has totalitarian tendencies since it is ruled by an inflexible party machine that shows no interest in human rights or related democratic norms. While the US has itself long been hamstrung by deadlocked and ineffectual governments it does have a constitution that protects certain core rights (such as free speech). Despite systematic predation (through copyright theft and monopoly power) by Internet oligarchs, the US also retains elements of a free press and it certainly has an independent judiciary. Furthermore, the European Economic Community (EEC) has already taken the first steps to establishing a more credible regime of regulation. In so doing it has shown that it is willing and able to take on the Internet oligarchs and force them to change their behaviour. So in the West there are real prospects of reining in at least some of the excesses.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0155\"/>But China is a very different story. According to reports its oppressive 'grid system' of systematic surveillance has been operating in Beijing since 2007. Aspects of this oppressive new system were summarised as long ago as 2013 in a Human Rights Report. For example:<br/>The new grid system divides the neighborhoods and communities into smaller units, each with a team of at least five administrative and security staff. In some Chinese cities the new grid units are as small as 5 or 10 households, each with a \"grid captain\" and a delegated system of collective responsibility ... Grid management is specifically intended to facilitate information-gathering by enabling disparate sources into a single, accessible and digitized system for use by officials. ... In Tibet the Party Secretary told officials that 'we must implement the urban grid management system. The key elements are focusing on ... really implementing grid management in all cities and towns, putting a dragnet into place to maintain stability. ... By 2012 the pilot system was in 'full swing' (as it had stored) nearly 10,000 basic data' (and collected) hundreds of pieces of information about conditions of the people (<link><marker>Human Rights Watch, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0155\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0305\"/>By 2015 this vast modern panopticon was ready to be rolled out to enable the full-on mass surveillance of China's 1. 4 billion citizens. Another report noted that:<br/>It envisages a national population database linking people's compulsory identity cards with their credit histories, travel records, hotel registrations and social security details. Police and state security agencies will have access to every aspect of a person's life at the click of a keyboard and everyone will be issued with a single 'all-in-one' identity card (<link><marker>Sheridan, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0305\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0045\"/>Since then further details of this oppressive and inescapable surveillance system have emerged. For example a Wired article by Rachel Botsman revealed that two Chinese data giants - China Rapid Finance and Sesame Credit - had been commissioned by the government to create the required infrastructure using copious amounts of big data. Free access to this vast resource means that people can be monitored, rated and evaluated in depth throughout their normal lives. It turns out that 'individuals on Sesame Credit are measured by a score ranging between 350 and 950 points.' While the algorithms remain secret the five factors employed are not - credit history, fulfilment capacity (or ability to abide by contractual arrangements), personal characteristics, behaviour and preferences and, finally, interpersonal relationships. Those with high scores get consumer choices, easy credit and the chance to travel; those with low scores become the new underclass with few meaningful choices at all. These are described as 'private platforms acting essentially as spy agencies for the government.' The author then adds that 'the government is attempting to make obedience feel like gaming. It is a method of social control dressed up in some points-reward system. It's gamified obedience' (<link><marker>Botsman, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0045\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0100\"/>What's particularly curious here is the inevitability of non-trivial perverse outcomes, foremost among which are the immense cultural and human costs. Masha Gessen's mesmerising and sometimes painful account of life in post-revolutionary Russia clearly demonstrates how hard it is to imagine that a cowed and passive population could retain sufficient awareness or creativity to contribute much of value to any culture, however instrumentally powerful it may appear (<link><marker>Gessen, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0100\"/></link>). In Botsman's view 'where these systems really descend into nightmarish territory is that the trust algorithms used are unfairly reductive. They don't take into account context.' Yet without a keen sense of context meaning becomes free-floating and elusive. Finally there's the inevitable emergence of 'reputation black markets selling under-the-counter ways to boost trustworthiness' (<link><marker>Botsman, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0045\"/></link>). Overall, this may turn out to be the world's prime contemporary example of a 'deformed future' in the making.</p><p>A second and equally subversive example is found in the growing use of voice-activated 'digital assistants' over the last few years. Skillfully packaged as mere 'assistants' and 'helpers' they are 'on' all the time and thus set to respond to every request and whim. Some of are equipped with female voices that are intended to exert a distinctly seductive effect as shown in Spike Jonez 2013 film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Her</emphasis>. What is less obvious (at least to the user) is that with each and every use the individuals concerned reveal ever more information about their not-so-private lives. Before long comprehensive profiles are assembled, preferences noted and rich fields of data produced.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0010\"/>As things currently stand, the operators of these systems own this treasure trove of information outright. They are then able to poke, prod and suggest new products and services in the light of those already consumed. Sales go up but consumers become ever more tightly bound to their own induced impulses and proclivities. Thus, instead of having open-ended learning experiences, of responding to challenges, of deepening their knowledge and understanding of their own authentic needs and human qualities, those who succumb can end up having 'feelings' for, and an ersatz fictional bond to, a remote impersonal network that exists only to exploit them. A further consequence of becoming over-reliant on such 'immersive' technologies is that the real-world skills and capacities of human beings start to atrophy. Memory, time keeping, spatial awareness are among the capabilities that wind down over time leaving people ever more dependent and at risk (<link><marker>Aitkin, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0010\"/></link>). In this case, as in many others, people are seduced into becoming a core component of the 'product' being sold. As the human interiors shrink and fall away, identity itself becomes elusive and problematic.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0165\"/>In summary, leaving the high-tech disruptors in any field to their own devices, so to speak, simply means that the human enterprise is subjected to random shocks and abuses that end up placing it in ever-greater peril. For Naomi Klein this is part of a deliberate playbook designed to provide a minority with greater dominance and power (<link><marker>Klein, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0165\"/></link>). But it's also the result of a certain kind of blindness that comes from over-valuing the technical and under-valuing the human and the social. If there's a consistent theme here it's that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">power in the wrong hands creates more problems than it solves</emphasis>. So high-tech innovation needs to be separated from simple notions of 'progress.' It is fundamentally a question of values and power - instrumental, cultural and symbolic. If humanity is to have any change of avoiding Dystopian outcomes human societies will need find new ways to own their own power and give only such of it as they judge necessary to governance structures that meet their real needs. Another way of saying this is that it's time to disrupt the disruptors. They've had their moment in the sun and the clouds are gathering. It's time for them to stand aside so that a different world can emerge.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Blind spots as opportunities</emphasis></h><p>It has been suggested throughout this enquiry that worldview limitations are complicit in supporting a kind of widely shared and selective blindness that prevents many of the key players from perceiving what is strikingly obvious to others. Three brief examples are provided here. One concerns the implications of Earth changes now under way. Another is how unthinking commitments to empiricism, technical determinism and neoliberalism have eroded key modalities of human and social existence. Finally there is a significant, but seldom appreciated, underlying concern regarding the nature and implications of constitutive human interests.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.1. Global context, global limits, global action</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0140\"/>Macro views of the contradictory and unsustainable condition of human civilisation have gained little or no traction with US corporations, the giants of Silicon Valley and their wealthy associates. This 'condition' obviously has multiple facets and there are many ways of coming to grips with it. For some observers a primary concern is the way humanity has laid waste to natural resources as a consequence of having outgrown the physical capacities of the global environment (<link><marker>Higgs, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0140\"/></link>). In this view issues around global warming, the scarcity of fresh water and the sixth extinction loom large. The accumulation of planetary impacts has given rise to the term 'Anthropocene' or era of human-related changes (<link><marker>Carrington, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0060\"/></link>; <link><marker>Slaughter, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0310\"/></link>; <link><marker>Steffen et al., 2015a</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0340\"/></link>). The term has slowly become accepted over recent years as those dedicated to 'Earth science' have provided numerous insights into the nature of large-scale processes of change.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0345\"/>Well-grounded knowledge about changing parameters of the global living space available to humans and other species has become both plentiful and increasingly reliable. It has, for example, provided valuable inputs to policy and decision-making at all levels. Work by Steffen and others on planetary boundaries is of particular salience (<link><marker>Steffen et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0340\"/></link><link><marker>Steffen et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0345\"/></link><link><marker>Steffen et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0335\"/></link>; <link><marker>Stockholm Research Centre, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0350\"/></link>). It shows how humanity has exceeded safe limits in three areas (flows of phosphorus and of nitrogen; loss of genetic diversity) and is set to exceed them in two others (land system change and climate change). Yet vital global concerns of this kind are not only widely overlooked by many high-tech entrepreneurs they are also actively denied by some of their most wealthy backers (<link><marker>Mayer, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0190\"/></link>). The very last thing the latter are prepared to recognise is the reality of global limits (<link><marker>Higgs, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0140\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0200\"/>Coming to grips with limits, the extent of human impacts and the choices and options available to humanity also provide many positive opportunities. Among these is the increased breadth and capability that flows from adopting more progressive values and broader, more inclusive worldviews (see below). Taking global issues seriously then opens up a plethora of actions and strategies that, properly understood, significantly enhances our individual and collective ability to navigate through the rough weather that undoubtedly lies ahead (<link><marker>Monbiot, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0200\"/></link>; <link><marker>Raworth, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0260\"/></link>). The New Economy Network Australia (NENA) is one of many organisations that demonstrate in practical terms how new economic structures and processes can be created both with, and without, official sanction (<link><marker>NENA, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0245\"/></link>). Other examples are discussed below.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.2. Re-valuing the human and social interiors</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref60015\"/>The empirical-analytic methods employed to create powerful technologies and to understand track macro phenomena both emerge from the 'exterior collective' quadrant of Integral enquiry. Yet taken in isolation they cannot grasp the nature of related human and cultural realities since they spring from very different sources and invoke different kinds of knowledge. Integral perspectives seek greater balance by adding an 'interior' dimension to both individual and collective phenomena (<link><marker>Fig. 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60015\"/></link>). The general lack of such distinctions helps explain (and indeed to resolve) some of the confusion and conflict that occurs when, for example, new waves of high-tech innovation (exterior collective) impact on human life worlds (interior individual) and pre-existing ways of life (interior collective). As noted, people, social systems and cultures are all deeply affected. Jobs are destroyed, professions disappear and machines primed to take over operations that were previously understood to exist solely within the domain of human action. Yet the study of history, the foundations of personhood, society and culture are only marginally accessible to empirical enquiry and are therefore routinely dismissed. Which is not to say that they cannot be studied and understood by those with the requisite skills, insight and methods (<link><marker>Esbjorn-Hargens, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0090\"/></link>).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference60015\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref60015\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr3SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr3LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p><anchor id=\"ref0300\"/>Fig. 3 - Four quadrants of Integral enquiry (<link><marker>Slaughter, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0300\"/></link>).</p></caption></nitf:media></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.3. Constitutive human interests</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref60020\"/>German philosopher Jurgen Habermas produced a series of works that made significant demands on readers yet also produced insights of continuing value. Of direct relevance here is his account of 'constitutive human interests.' Unlike much of his work the essence of such interests are easily grasped and usefully illuminate a number of vital social processes that tend to be overlooked in high-tech environments. <link><marker>Fig. 4</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60020\"/></link> provides an outline of Habermas theory. In this account, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the technical interest</emphasis> relates to 'work' and the empirical/analytic sciences that are centrally concerned with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">production and control</emphasis> (i.e. the application of technical rules to instrumental problems). <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The practical interest</emphasis> is about human interaction. Here the concern is not with control, nor with technical processes, but with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">communication and understanding</emphasis>, both of which are grounded in language and culture. The point is to clarify the conditions for clear and unobstructed communication between participating subjects. These are seen as interpretive tasks requiring appropriate skills. The third and perhaps 'highest' interest is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the emancipatory interest</emphasis>. This relates to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">questions of power and the universal drive for emancipation and freedom of action</emphasis> (<link><marker>Habermas, 1971</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0120\"/></link>).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference60020\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref60020\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr4SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr4LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 4 - Habermas' constitutive human interests (<link><marker>Habermas, 1971</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0120\"/></link>).</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p>At no point does Habermas denigrate the technical interest per se since civilisation depends upon the maintenance of effective and efficient technical processes. Rather, what he is set against is the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">over-extension</emphasis> of the technical into areas that he considers illegitimate - as, for example, when decisions about new technologies are made on the basis of 'can it be done?' rather than 'should it be done?' One is a pragmatic issue concerned with technique; the other is value-laden and grounded in ethical considerations. This distinction has been widely overlooked in the present context. Then concerning the practical interest, there are many non-technical factors (such as power, ideology, marketing and direct exploitation) that impede and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">prevent</emphasis> true communication taking place between individuals and groups. The issue then becomes that of defining the conditions under which communication can be optimised. This again is not a technical question but one that relates to the richer and more complex world of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">human intersubjectivity</emphasis>. Finally, the emancipatory interest is engaged in the critique of domination, repression, mystification and institutional inertia. It tries to define the conditions within which people can create <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">an authentic existence</emphasis> for themselves.</p><p>Unfortunately however, questions of limits, of the character and requirements of 'the social' and the whole question of underlying human interests - actual human needs and qualities - mean little or nothing to techno-enthusiasts and Internet entrepreneurs. As we've seen their speech patterns, metaphors, discourses were, and remain, focused on the single-minded pursuit of power, exploitation, expansion and accumulation of immense financial rewards. These features go a long way towards explaining why the Internet and many associated technologies became debased and also why they parted company from authentic human and social needs. The rise of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">homo economicus</emphasis> and the rapid expansion of humanly arid technical systems could not but produce a generalised Dystopian sense that human affairs were spinning out of control. During the second decade of the 21st Century traditional research, scholarship and the scientific method itself were also being undermined by the diminished rationality of technical innovation coupled with denialism on an astonishing scale. Moreover, the tendency of traditional disciplines toward subject compartmentalism made it difficult to address the growing complexities of macro-change. Many people began to experience a sense of the coming-apart of earlier structures and assumptions, often expressed as multiple failures.

Governance virtually everywhere has become more difficult. So it is regrettable, but not entirely surprising, that high-tech innovators have had little of value to say about the world they have been attempting to create. So long as their own innovations made it to market, these 'straws in the wind' were held to be of little significance. A variety of non-empirical and broad-based approaches to understanding were quietly developing in the background. Yet since they are too numerous to receive adequate attention here they might well form the basis of a separate work.5</p><p>Overall, the selective blindness the high-tech sector is less an indication of strength and power than of 'thin' and, in the long run, unproductive views of reality. For this to change the entire sector - and those who seek to replace or reinvigorate it - would do well to re-direct their attention toward blind spots such as those outlined here. Properly understood they provide creative springboards, stimuli for new thinking and radically new opportunities.

Transcending reductionism, re-purposing the Internet</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.1. Interior drivers, scales of implementation</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0135\"/>Virtually everyone outside the Silicon Valley bubble who has paused to consider the complex tangle of issues thrown up by the IT revolution in general and the Internet in particular tends, at some point, to reach a key conclusion - that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the key issues before us are not primarily technical</emphasis>. Technology provides the physical substrate and software an artificial 'nervous system' that reaches ever more deeply into human lives. But merely following technical capabilities as far as they can be driven appears to confine humanity on a fast train to Dystopia and perhaps the end of human civilisation itself. Juval Harari unintentionally provided a rehearsal, or test case, for that thesis in his book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Homo Deus</emphasis> (<link><marker>Harari, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0135\"/></link>). Here the main driver of change was considered to be the ingenuity of large groups of people and their most significant achievements, indeed, are said to be those associated with high technology. Yet by relentlessly following this technologically determinist path the outlook for what the author refers to as 'unaugmented' humans is that they are expected to fall by the wayside and become the 'road kill' of history. It is severe and uncompromising conclusion but consistent with the starting assumptions. If, on the other hand, the uses of high-tech are shaped and conditioned by progressive social drivers - such as life-affirming values and expanded worldviews - the outcomes would certainly be very different. So in playing a reductionist game with the very forces that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">moderate</emphasis> raw technical power - language, values, worldviews and similar culturally derived sources of meaning and capability - Harari actually demonstrates how vitally necessary they really are (<link><marker>Slaughter, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0320\"/></link>). Nor is this the only source that confirms this vital insight.10</p><p>There are clearly many aspects to this story and a growing number of informed observers of this rapidly changing scene. As mentioned in the previous paper, Greenfield views the IT revolution less as an overwhelming success than a full-on invasion. So he seeks to explore the implications of what he regards as 'the colonisation of everyday life by information processing.' As with other critical approaches he is interested not merely in raw outcomes but also in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">motives</emphasis> of promoters, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ideas</emphasis> behind the hardware and the social <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">interests</emphasis> involved.15 Working at a more fine-grained level and acknowledging such interests helps to re-frame core assumptions within corporate and business environments.20</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0110\"/>Greenfield considers the Internet of Things (IoT) at three scales of implementation: the human body (or the 'quantified self'), the home environment (or 'smart home') and public spaces (the 'smart city') (<link><marker>Greenfield, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0110\"/></link>). Such terms are already in wide circulation but Greenfield wants to probe more deeply into what they mean through actual case studies. As noted above, the marketing of high-tech devices commonly highlight assumed benefits to users but obscure underlying corporate benefits. So at the individual human scale biometric devices such as the Fitbit and the Apple Watch monitor a variety of health and fitness indices. Yet once again the flows of personal data are valued, analysed and used as inputs to advertising and sales. Insurance companies have obvious interests in these skewed transactions and some offer reductions in premiums in exchange for such personal data. Truck and public service drivers are especially vulnerable to the imposition of more heavy-handed versions. Then, unless this trend is halted, the intensive collection of personal data may be required of all drivers and other persons responsible for vehicles and related machinery. The logical end point of this insidious process is nothing less than the imposition of total surveillance.</p><p>At the scale of housing, 'smart homes' are beginning to be promoted on grounds of safety, security and convenience. But the rise of home-based 'digital assistants' requires careful consideration. Greenfield notes that 'although the choices these ... offer to us are presented as neutral, they are built on numerous inbuilt assumptions that many of us would question if we were to truly scrutinise them'. In relation to Amazon's rapid order 'dash button', for example, he adds:<br/>The benefit to the individual customer is tiny compared with what Amazon gains. Sure, you never run out of cat food. But Amazon gets data on the time and place of your need, as well as its frequency and intensity, and that data has value. It is an asset, and you can be sure that Amazon will exploit it in every way its terms and conditions permit - including by using it to develop behavioural models that map our desires in high resolution, so as to target them with even greater efficiency in the future (<link><marker>Greenfield, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0110\"/></link>).</p><p>Then, in relation to the IoT and at the scale of the 'smart city' Greenfield identifies core elements of what he calls the 'guiding ideology' of the Internet. It employs decontextualised and stripped down notions of language and meaning that preclude features such as uncertainty and interpretation. In such a view the world appears 'perfectly knowable' which implies that technical systems can encode it 'without bias or distortion.' Consequently, when applied to cities:<br/>This is effectively an argument that there is one and only one correct solution to each identified need; that this solution can be arrived at algorithmically, via the operations of a technical system furnished with the proper inputs; and that this solution is something that can be encoded in public policy, without distortion (<link><marker>Greenfield, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0110\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0040\"/>That these observations are not merely theoretical is confirmed by the emergence of 'Google Urbanism,' an ambitious plan by the company's Alphabet subsidiary to reconfigure cities in its own image. Its pilot project on the Toronto waterfront seeks to 'reimagine urban life in five dimensions - housing, energy, mobility, social services and shared public spaces.' But what is causing most concern is a proposed 'data-harvesting, wi-fi beaming digital layer' that would provide a 'single unified source of information about what is going on.' This would gather 'an astonishing level of detail' such that 'each passing footstep and bicycle tire could be accounted for and managed.' Issues of privacy and the blurring of public and private interests may be trumped, however, by the suspicion that 'the role of technology in urban life is obvious: It is a money-maker' (<link><marker>Bliss, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0040\"/></link>). For Morozov, ever on the alert for new forms of Internet solutionism, such heavy-handed developments signal 'the end of politics.' He comments that:<br/>Even neoliberal luminaries like Friedrich Hayek allowed for some non-market forms of social organisation in the urban domain. They saw planning as a necessity imposed by the physical limitations of urban spaces: there was no other cheap way of operating infrastructure, building streets, avoiding congestion. For Alphabet, these constraints are no more: continuous data flows can replace government rules with market signals. (<link><marker>Morozov, 2017c</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0215\"/></link>)</p><p>Seen in this light the emergence of high-end 'smart cities' represents a further incursion of technical expertise into the lifeworlds of people, the ethos of cultures and the character of the settlements where much of humanity lives. Greenfield's conclusions therefore speak directly to this process. He finishes with several recommendations that can be summarised as follows.<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The use of algorithms to guide the distribution of public resources should be regarded as a political act.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Claims of perfect competence in relation to 'smart city' rhetoric should be rejected.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Any approach the whole IT domain should include a healthy dose of skepticism.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Commercial attempts to gather ever more data about people should be resisted (<link><marker>Greenfield, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0110\"/></link>).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.2. Taming the ubiquitous algorithm</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0250\"/>Standing at the core of a vast number of IT processes is the ubiquitous algorithm. Its relative obscurity and foundation in mathematics means, however, that for many people it remains a mystery. But this need not continue. Cathy O'Neil was originally employed as a 'quant' in the heart of the New York financial district prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). She saw first-hand, how the algorithms that exploit 'big data' can be used productively or as instruments of power and exploitation. In her view most people are unaware of how these new capabilities have proliferated. Consequently the reliance of bureaucratic systems on them is seldom appreciated. In the US she notes that 'getting into college, getting a job, being assessed as a worker, getting a credit card or insurance, voting, and even policing are in many cases done algorithmically.' She adds that:<br/>Moreover, the technology introduced into these systematic decisions is largely opaque, even to their creators, and has so far largely escaped meaningful regulation, even when it fails. That makes the question of which of these algorithms are working on our behalf even more important and urgent (<link><marker>O'Neil, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>She uses a 'four-layer hierarchy' in relation to what she calls 'bad algorithms.' At the first level are those with 'unintentional problems that reflect cultural biases'. Next are those that 'go bad through neglect.' Third are those that she regards as 'nasty but legal' and finally 'intentionally nefarious and sometimes outright illegal algorithms.' In relation to the latter she adds that:<br/>There are hundreds of private companies, including dozens in the UK, that offer mass surveillance tools. They are marketed as a way of locating terrorists or criminals, but they can be used to target and root out citizen activists. And because they collect massive amounts of data, predictive algorithms and scoring systems are used to filter out the signal from the noise (<link><marker>O'Neil, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>The scam run by Volkswagon to conceal the results of emissions tests is, in her view, perhaps the most well known example, but the sale of surveillance systems to repressive regimes looms larger as a serious future threat. In her 2016 book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Weapons of Math Destruction</emphasis> she looks into numerous context only to find the same dynamic at work. In one case a school district attempted to identify the weakest teachers and designed a set of tests of 'teacher effectiveness' using algorithms. Many of the criteria, however, such as how well students were learning year to year, could not be measured directly. The use of unverifiable proxies resulted in wildly varying results - but teachers were sacked anyway. From this and other cases O'Neil concluded that many algorithms are poorly designed and proxies used in place of real data invisibly distort the results. Another oft-experienced trap is where hidden feedback loops render data meaningless the more often they are run within a system. What is also significant about this account is that the underlying issues are less about mathematics, statistics or data, than they are about transparency (or its lack) power and control. Currently in the US, for example, the well off can usually afford human representation whereas the poor are left with poorly performing data and a bureaucracy they can neither influence nor communicate with. In summary, used well algorithms can be tools that usefully extract value from big data. Used poorly, they can certainly ramp up the efficiency of operations but at the cost of unreliable or unjust results and increasing inequality.</p><p>O'Neil suggests a number of solutions, none of which are short term or particularly easy to implement without wider social support. 'First and foremost', she suggests, 'we need to start keeping track.' For example, 'each criminal algorithm we discover should be seen as a test case. Do the rule-breakers get into trouble? How much? Are the rules enforced, and what is the penalty?' She continues:<br/>Even once we start building a track record of enforcement, we have ourselves an arms race. We can soon expect a fully-fledged army of algorithms that skirt laws, that are sophisticated and silent, and that seek to get around rules and regulations. They will learn from how others were caught and do it better the next time. In other words, it will get progressively more difficult to catch them cheating. Our tactics have to get better over time too (<link><marker>O'Neil, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>Finally she suggests that:<br/>We need to demand more access and ongoing monitoring, especially once we catch them in illegal acts. For that matter, entire industries, such as algorithms for insurance and hiring, should be subject to these monitors, not just individual culprits. It's time to gird ourselves for a fight. It will eventually be a technological arms race, but it starts, now, as a political fight. We need to demand evidence that algorithms with the potential to harm us be shown to be acting fairly, legally, and consistently. When we find problems, we need to enforce our laws with sufficiently hefty fines that companies don't find it profitable to cheat in the first place. This is the time to start demanding that the machines work for us, and not the other way around (<link><marker>O'Neil, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>O'Neil's program for re-purposing algorithms is certainly ambitious but, given the plethora of unresolved issues in this area, it seems entirely appropriate. In her book she also calls for a 'model builder's pledge' (similar to the Hippocratic Oath taken by medical practitioners) a full-scale regulatory system, algorithmic audits and greater investments in research. In light of this she speaks approvingly of Princeton's Web Transparency and Accountability Project and European approaches (noted below) that are, even now, starting to dictate a new raft of terms and conditions that the Internet giants will have to recognise. Ultimately, she returns to the same ground that others have indicated in arguing that such choices are fundamentally moral, hence also ethical and social.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.3. Defensive measures, key questions</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0080\"/>Many options are available to those who are willing to invest the time and effort required. In mid-2017, for example, Australian reporter Rose Donahue interviewed Helen Nissenbaum in New York about what the latter calls the 'obfustication movement.' This was described as a 'David and Goliath' strategy that relied on the fact that the former had more freedom to act than the latter (<link><marker>Donahue, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0080\"/></link>). Donahue noted that Nissenbaum had developed tools specifically designed to disrupt Google's tracking and ad delivery systems. One called 'TrackMeNot' allows users to browse undisturbed under the cover of randomly generated searches. Another dubbed 'AdNauseum' is a tool that collects data from every site visited by the user and stores them in a vault. This vastly overstates the user's activity and therefore serves Google false information. While such tools may at present appeal only to a minority there are undoubtedly many more to come. A high-tech defensive war against the overreach of Internet oligarchs is increasingly likely. Many of these tools will become easier to use and personal agency will be enhanced as more people avail themselves of them.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0015\"/>In summary, the present Internet has evolved - or 'de-evolved' - into its present condition over an extended period. It will therefore not easily be prised from the grasp of giant corporations. Repurposing the Internet will take time. It will take concerted social and political action as well as extensive technical backup. Charles Arthur credits online rights activist Aral Balkan with the following insight: 'If you see technology as an extension of the self, then what is at stake is the integrity of our selves'. He continues: 'Without that - without individual sovereignty - we're looking at a new slavery' (<link><marker>Arthur, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0015\"/></link>).

As the wider implications of IT revolution cause more and more people to focus upon them so new players will need to become more involved in the search for solutions. Governments, city authorities and civic administrators at all levels will need to be open to new forms of social engagement. They, in turn will also need greater support from an informed public.25</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Productive innovation</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.1. Social democracy</emphasis></h><p>Many of the decisions and practices of the high-tech innovators and oligarchs have gained support from prevailing assumptions about the market, the consumer, a minimal role for government and so on. Yet despite its broad influence the durability of neoliberalism as a guiding ideology should not be overstated. An in-depth review of neoliberalism by Metcalf refers to a 2016 paper published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that explicitly connects the former with some of its most significant consequences. These include 'pushing deregulation on economies around the world ... forcing open national markets to trade and capital, and for demanding that governments shrink themselves via austerity or privatisation' (<link><marker>Metcalf, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0195\"/></link>). While such insights may appear unremarkable in themselves they represent a startling admission by the IMF whose policies have long supported such practices. The author also suggests that the ideology should not be seen merely a 'standard right wing wish list' but rather 'a way of reordering social reality, and of re-thinking our status as individuals.' Viewed in this light the main premise - that 'competition is the only legitimate organising principle for human activity' - seems unlikely to remain viable over the longer term since it rules out and overwhelms vital human capacities. These include care, compassion, philanthropy and the like which all healthy societies need in order to function at all. The decline of neoliberal values and assumptions would also mean that previously unthinkable options would emerge, as would new strategies to reform the system. A 'new normal' would have its chance to become established.</p><p>In the UK a resurgent Labour Party raises the possibility that just such a development could be occurring through the rise of social democracy. Rundle summarises what he considers to be some of the wider implications. In this distinctively optimistic view local, national and global societies could:<br/>Be run as a tripartite process of state, market and community institutions, with a \"democratically enabling\" state enforcing limits to the private sector, mandating social-economic spaces into which community/open/free/collective activities can expand, and having democratic socialised ownership, whole or part, of key economic sectors.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0265\"/>Such a shift has major implications for all sectors of the economy - which includes IT systems and the Internet. He continues:<br/>That means ultimately that energy, water, resources, finance capital and communications infrastructure should be seen as social in nature, part-owned by the state, and certainly steered by it, through, for example, elected public boards. It means recognising that when corporations such as Google become monopoly default resources, they have de facto socialised themselves and institutional arrangements should reflect that (<link><marker>Rundle, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0265\"/></link>).</p><p>Raw suggestions in this form have a long way to go before they can be rendered into widespread practice. Yet they make a good deal of sense in the current context. Google/Alphabet, for example, may thus far have avoided the rigours of US anti-trust regulations but this may turn out to be a temporary 'victory' as other governments step in to take actions based on alternative assumptions and views (see below). Rundle's piece also demonstrates yet again why so many observers and critics of the IT revolution argue that the central issues are not primarily technical but social and political. Society as a whole needs to take part in multi-faceted conversations of this kind.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.2. New infrastructure</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0180\"/>There's no shortage of ideas and proposals regarding 'what needs to be done' to re-design and re-direct the Internet and, by extension, high-tech innovation in general. Helen Magretts of the Oxford Internet Institute is no exception. In order to deal with aspects of Internet aggression she suggests that:<br/>Any successful attempt to prevent extremist, abusive and hateful behaviour online must be multifaceted, thoughtful and collaborative. It will involve ethical and legal frameworks to guide as well as mandate good behaviour; working with tech companies rather than making enemies of them; smarter policing of activities that are already illegal; and crowdsourcing safety, so that people and social enterprises play a role (<link><marker>Magretts, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0180\"/></link>).</p><p>Cathy O'Neil puts a strong case for the establishment of a new infrastructure to deal with the uses and misuses of algorithms. She seeks to create reliable records of how these tools are used and by whom. She also knows that to do so will not be easy as powerful organisations normally resist being called to account. She writes that:<br/>We need to demand more access and ongoing monitoring, especially once we catch them in illegal acts... We need to demand evidence that algorithms with the potential to harm us be shown to be acting fairly, legally, and consistently. When we find problems, we need to enforce our laws with sufficiently hefty fines that companies don't find it profitable to cheat in the first place. This is the time to start demanding that the machines work for us, and not the other way around (<link><marker>O'Neil, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>Taplin goes further than most in optimistically proposing what he calls a 'digital renaissance.' This has various features that include:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>a shorter working week and the establishment of a universal basic income (UBI);</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>measures to get the technical and creative communities working together;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>revisions of the 'safe harbour' provisions in the DMCA act;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>the Library of Congress issuing new guidelines as to the 'fair use' of creative and copyrighted material;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>revisions to, and wider application of, anti-trust regulations (to break up monoplies); and,</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>a proliferation of co-operatives, non-profit companies, and what he calls 'zero-marginal-cost distribution systems (<link><marker>Taplin, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0355\"/></link>).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p><anchor id=\"ref0270\"/>In this latter respect Taplin echoes suggestions by Rushkoff that were noted in a previous paper. Rushkoff is interested in exploring a range of social and economic inventions in the context of re-thinking what money is and is for (<link><marker>Rushkoff, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0270\"/></link>). Finally Morozov (whose work has contributed substantially to this enquiry) suggests that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a single data utility</emphasis> would be best placed to make the best use of material from divergent sources. In the light of current experience with commercial entities it would need to be non-commercial and publically owned, much as Rundle has suggested. Given that progressive governments could set up such utilities quite easily the next step would be to ensure that 'whoever wants to build new services on top of that data would need to do so in a competitive, heavily regulated environment while paying a corresponding share of their profits for using it.' He adds that 'such a prospect would scare big technology firms much more than the prospect of a fine' (<link><marker>Morozov, 2017a</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0205\"/></link>).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.3. Effective regulation</emphasis></h><p>When the European Union (EU) handed Facebook a $120\u202fm fine in May 2017 and Google a heavy $2.4bn in June, both for market abuses, many wondered what the next step would be. By mid-2017 the answer came in the form of another acronym - the GDPR (or general data protection regulation). Long time observer of the IT scene, John Naughton, emphasised that GDPR is not a directive but a regulation so it will become law in all EU countries at the same time. Some of the implications are as follows:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The purpose of the new regulation is to strengthen and rationalise data protection for all individuals within the EU. It also covers the export of personal data to outside the bloc. Its aims are to give control back to EU residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying regulation.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The GDPR extends EU data-protection law to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> foreign companies that process the data of EU residents. So even if a company has no premises or presence within the EU, if it processes EU data it will be bound by the regulation. And the penalties for non-compliance or infringement are eye watering, even by Internet standards: fines up to (EURO)20\u202fm and/or 4% of global turnover.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>More significantly, the GDPR extends the concept of \"personal data\" to bring it into line with the online world... The regulation gives important new rights to citizens over the use of their personal information... Valid consent has to be explicitly obtained for any data collected <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and for the uses to which it will be put</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Citizens will now have the right to request the deletion of personal information related to them (<link><marker>Naughton, 2017a</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0235\"/></link>;).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>This is obviously what pundits call a 'game changer' as it fundamentally changes the rules for how these organisations collect, will be able to use and manage private data. Naughton calls it an 'existential threat' to those currently operating beyond the reach of existing data regulation laws. It will certainly help to resolve the present situation in which people's private lives everywhere are regarded as 'fair game' to entities whose sole interests lie in sales, profit and power. And it will go a long way to resolving some, but by no means all, of the concerns expressed so clearly by <link><marker>Zuboff (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0390\"/></link> and others. At the same time it should be recognised that public service sectors such as education and health will have to adjust their own procedures and this will involve considerable costs.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.4. The technical is political - the return of anti-trust</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0210\"/>As the oligarchs have steadily penetrated ever more areas of human and economic life they've become so powerful that they abjure regulation by elected bodies and are frequently said to be way 'ahead' in terms of their products and services. But this is a mistake. If we accept that the technical is political it is harder to confuse technical mastery with other forms of expertise. As ever, Morozov nails the core of this confusion by reference to underlying social interests. He poses the following question:<br/>How could one possibly expect a bunch of rent-extracting enterprises with business models that are reminiscent of feudalism to resuscitate global capitalism and to establish a new New Deal that would constrain the greed of capitalists, many of whom also happen to be the investors behind these firms? (<link><marker>Morozov, 2017b</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0210\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0330\"/>During mid-to-late 2017 it was clear that, while the Internet giants were not about to collapse, social and political forces on both sides of the Atlantic were beginning to line up in broadly the same direction. Signs were emerging that might be called their 'golden age' could be coming to a close. In September, for example, the Guardian editorialised that 'Amazon's dominance of the eBook market may not have raised prices, but it left the sector anaemic and competition floundering'. Another commentator was quoted as saying of the oligarchs that he did not think 'any credible economist who isn't an Ayn Rand lunatic would accept that these are not monopolies'; also that 'Amazon sells 65% of books online now, Google controls 80% of the search market' (McChesney in <link><marker>Solon &amp; Siddiqui, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0330\"/></link>). More people than ever are becoming aware of the fact that something is very wrong with this picture.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0325\"/>During the same month Ben Smith, a well-regarded Buzzfeed writer, was among the first of many to confirm what he called a 'palpable, perhaps permanent, turn against the tech industry.' He added that 'the new corporate leviathans that used to be seen as bright new avatars of American innovation are increasingly portrayed as sinister new centres of unaccountable power.' In his view this constituted 'a transformation likely to have major consequences for the industry and for American politics' (<link><marker>Smith, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0325\"/></link>). He also reported on how politicians of widely differing views were urging 'big tech' to be considered less as private companies than as 'public utilities.' After years of denying the value or relevance of treating the high-tech giants in the same way that Bell Telephone and Microsoft had been treated in earlier years (i.e. broken up into small units) anti-trust legislation was finally back on the agenda. Similarly Washington senators Elizabeth Warren and Claire McCaskill both became involved in making anti-trust regulations part of the Democratic agenda over the next four years. Overall, the gap between ideas and effective action was perceptibly closing.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. Humanising and democratising the IT revolution</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.1. Public goods and moral universals</emphasis></h><p>If anything has become clear during the present enquiry it is that humanising the IT revolution requires something other than technical innovation. It obviously has many technical implications but the key drivers of a multi-faceted shift toward a different <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">modus operandi</emphasis> are not technical but found within human, social and cultural contexts. As Zuboff noted in relation to big data, 'it is not an autonomous process ... it originates in the social, and it is here that we must find it and know it' (<link><marker>Zuboff, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0390\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0130\"/>The current 'de-evolved' Internet and explosion of radically ambivalent high-tech innovations provide clear evidence of an extended and continuing cultural failure. Despite its many positive aspects it's becoming harder to avoid the fact that the US has become enmeshed in its own downward spiral. Countless words have been written on this topic but one core concern is its singular lack of success in creating viable 'public goods' such as free health care, quality education, protection from random violence and public wellbeing on a broad scale. Umair Haque argues that the lack of such goods separates the US from all other advanced nations. The former spring from 'moral universals' that he suggests are largely absent from the US but which are needed to 'anchor a society in a genuinely shared prosperity.' Such universals don't simply 'spread the wealth' but help to civilise people. They 'let people grow to become sane, humane, intelligent human beings' - all characteristics upon which democracy depends. Any society lacking these characteristics simply runs out of steam. In this view, what happened in the US is that:<br/>They have never seen - and still don't see - the benefits: the civilising process that democracy depends on. Thus, in America today, there are no broad, genuine, or accessible civilising mechanisms left. ... The natural consequence of failing to civilise is breaking down as a democracy - democracy no longer exists in the sense of \"people cooperating by voting to give each other greater prosperity\". They have merely learned to take prosperity away from one another (<link><marker>Haque, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0130\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0115\"/>Such suggestions must be treated as debatable, yet Haque is not alone in advancing this general argument. Noted Australian journalist, Peter Greste is in broad agreement. In his opinion 'since America's founding, its leaders have recognised that the country's real authority - as opposed to power - rests on its moral standing.' Yet the routine outpouring of ignorance by the US president has 'placed the US on the same moral plane as some of the world's most ruthless tyrants.' He finds this 'deeply troubling' because 'without a clear moral framework, the world becomes a snake pit of competing national interests' (<link><marker>Greste, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0115\"/></link>). Such sentiments provide yet another factor that helps to account for the debased version of Internet usage and commerce that became normalised over recent years.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.2. Values, worldviews, research</emphasis></h><p>Taken together the above goes a long way toward explaining why the Internet became compromised. It not only failed to deliver on the idealism of its early proponents but also became a source of exploitation, danger and oppression. The many and varied uses of IT are divided between the genuinely helpful and those that are routinely misused. At least two underlying rationales for moving toward the former can be briefly mentioned here. One springs from value and worldview considerations. An outlook typified by greed, selfishness, exploitation and an underlying disregard for real human and social needs will produce, and has produced, applications adapted to these uses. On the other hand positive values such as generosity, care and respect, especially when coupled with socio-centric or world-centric outlooks, will be directed toward more widely useful and constructive uses. This identifies a core difference between, say, monopoly platforms that treat people like mindless sheep by driving them into the arms of the advertising industry, and socially useful innovations such as local currencies, that respect and build local economic and social wellbeing.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0075\"/>As noted above, a different, but related, rationale can be drawn from evidence-based Earth science. The latter makes it abundantly clear that humanity is under real and unrelenting pressure to re-think the conditions of its tenancy of this small planet. Here values such as caring, foresight and obligations to future generations come to the fore. They simply make better sense in this context. Roger Dennis is not alone in suggesting that leaders in technology need broader and deeper views of the world. In fact he suggests that 'the industry doesn't need more programmers, it urgently needs more women, ethicists and philosophers' (<link><marker>Dennis, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0075\"/></link>). Political decision-making about the uses and abuses of all classes of high technology need to be returned from 'defence' contractors, specialised labs and private corporations to well-staffed and properly equipped locations firmly placed within the governance and related structures of civil societies. This process will certainly include private initiatives that draw both on progressive values and emerging technologies to help break the multi-monopolies of currently over-dominant players (<link><marker>Ahmed, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0005\"/></link>). It follows that effective and helpful innovation does not necessarily mean expanding the size of governments per se, but it will certainly require overturning any residual notion that 'markets rule.' Clearly they don't and can't.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0150\"/>Another way to 'humanise the future' is to ensure that sufficient human and economic resources are directed toward high quality evaluation and research. In late 2017, for example, the Oxford Internet Institute found clear statistical evidence that during the previous US election 'the balance between freedom of speech and election interference has been tipped.' Specifically 'Twitter users got more information, polarising and conspiratorial content than professionally produced news' and 'average levels of misinformation were higher in swing stages than in uncontested states' (<link><marker>Howard &amp; Kollanyi, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0150\"/></link>). Junk news is an ideal medium for the further propagation of junk science. So the researchers came up with a short list of actions to deal with the abuses they uncovered. These include:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Up-dating the Uniform Commercial Code ... forcing companies to adhere to basic anti-spam and truth-in-advertising rules;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Ensuring that paid political content on social media is accompanied by the disclosure of backers;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Social media platforms be required to file political advertising and bot networks with election officials; and,</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Bots in general be clearly identified to users (<link><marker>Howard &amp; Kollanyi, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0150\"/></link>).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p><anchor id=\"ref0085\"/>Not long after this the Economist magazine (not particularly well known for having a progressive outlook) ran a 'leader' story that posed the question Do social media threaten democracy? One reason provided was that 'far from bringing enlightenment, social media have been spreading poison' (<link><marker>Economist, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0085\"/></link>). Clearly disquiet with social media is no longer limited to a few marginal sources. During 2017 disruptions to vital democratic processes - especially during the US election and the 'Brexit' referendum - carried out by Russian and other sources had been acknowledged and documented in detail (<link><marker>Cadwalladr, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0055\"/></link>). Given the complexity of issues involved, high quality research and monitoring of such activities becomes vital. It allows knowledge and policy-formulation to be up-dated, miscreants to be identified and, overall, routine reality checking to occur.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.3. Sharing cities, platform cooperativism</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0295\"/>Nowhere is the potential for new kinds of IT-enabled organisations and practices more timely and useful than in relation to cities and cooperatives. For example, in Darren Sharp's view the notion of Sharing Cities - rather than merely 'smart' ones lacking a social contract with citizens - can serve as 'an antidote to top-down technologically deterministic visions of the future.' His vision is one in which existing infrastructure such as wi-fi and spaces within public buildings are made more widely available. He looks to Seoul and Amsterdam for examples of how a sharing approach is actually working. In summary he suggests that 'Sharing Cities create pathways for participation that recognise the city as a commons and give everyone the opportunity to enjoy access to common goods and create new forms of shared value, knowledge and prosperity' (<link><marker>Sharp, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0295\"/></link>). That this is not an isolated example and should be seen in a much wider context is demonstrated in a fine collection of 137 case studies. This is much more than a 'how-to' reference work as it presents <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a vision</emphasis> for cities that situate people (rather than the market, technology or governance) at the core of what cities are and how they operate (<link><marker>Shareable, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0290\"/></link>).</p><p>In a similar vein Rushkoff explores the potential of democratically focused social and economic innovations. Drawing inspiration from existing examples he highlights possible characteristics of IT-enabled 'steady state' enterprises, 'platform cooperatives' and 'genuinely distributist businesses.' Such features include the need to 'reclaim values' in support of 'women's equality, integrative medicine, worker ownership and local currency' (Rushkoff, 2016, 215-37). Platform cooperatives are among the most promising of new IT-enabled and democratically constituted organisational forms. One of the most thorough treatments of this emergent phenomenon is provided by Trebor Scholz. As with many other observers he is clear about the need for change. For example he writes that:<br/>We cannot have a conversation about labour platforms without first acknowledging that they depend on exploited human lives all along their global supply chains, starting with the hardware without which this entire \"weightless\" economy would sink to the bottom of the ocean. ... (Similarly) this isn't merely a continuation of pre-digital capitalism as we know it, there are notable discontinuities - new levels of exploitation and concentration of wealth for which I penned the term crowd fleecing. Crowd fleecing is a new form of exploitation, put in place by four or five upstarts, to draw on a global pool of millions of workers in real time (Scholz, 2016, 3-4).</p><p>In Scholz' view what he calls 'platform cooperativism' is the coming together of three elements: the existing technical know-how of existing monopoly platforms, a sense of solidarity and reframing concepts like 'innovation' with a view to sharing the rewards. He also provides a typology of platform cooperatives and a useful list of guiding principles:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Ownership.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Decent pay and income security.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Transparency and data portability.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Appreciation and acknowledgement.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Co-determined work.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>A protective legal framework.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Portable worker protections and benefits.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Protection against arbitrary behaviour.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Rejection of excessive workplace surveillance.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The right to log off (Scholz, 2016, 18-21).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>For Scholz the core of the issue is 'a new story about sharing, aggregation, openness and cooperation.' Equally significant is that his view of the present incumbents may be iconoclastic but it is certainly not punitive. Rather:<br/>The importance of platform cooperativism does not lie in \"killing the death star platforms.\" It does not come from destroying the dark overlords like Uber but it comes from writing over them in people's minds, and then inserting them back into the mainstream (Scholz, 2016, 26).</p><p>This is clearly a human and social process that seeks to recover values that were cast aside in the single-minded pursuit of growth and profit. This, it seems, is the very foundational work that can help to rehumanise and democratise both the Internet and the IT revolution on which it is founded.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7. Conclusion: values and moral development</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0240\"/>This and the previous papers have commented on certain value and worldview limitations that arguably characterise both the ethos of Silicon Valley and some of its leading figures. More recently John Naughton took up the issue of what he calls the 'astonishing naivety of the tech crowd' himself. For him a plausible explanation can be found in the restricted nature of the latter's educational backgrounds - mainly mathematics, engineering and computer science. He notes that these are 'wonderful disciplines' but then goes on to suggest that:<br/>mastering them teaches students very little about society or history - or indeed about human nature. As a consequence, the new masters of our universe are people who are essentially only half-educated. They have had no exposure to the humanities or the social sciences, the academic disciplines that aim to provide some understanding of how society works, of history and of the roles that beliefs, philosophies, laws, norms, religion and customs play in the evolution of human culture (<link><marker>Naughton, 2017b</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0240\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0370\"/>Some may regard these as contentious topics yet there are quite straightforward ways of addressing them in this context. One is to go back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) that was signed off by the United Nations (UN) back in 1948. Here there are a couple of specific articles that speak directly to the themes of this paper, as follows:<br/>Article 12<br/>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">privacy</emphasis>, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.<br/>Article 22<br/>Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realisation, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organisation and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">dignity</emphasis> and the free development of his personality (<link><marker>United Nations, 1948</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0370\"/></link>;).</p><p>These statements clearly established that the nations of the world were firm in their belief that the privacy and dignity of all human beings were to be respected and maintained in perpetuity. After the horror of two disastrous world wars they were deemed to be of particular value and significance. Yet the high-tech sector almost everywhere seems to have lost sight of these vital commitments. Wendell Bell later took up the theme of 'universal human values' in volume 2 of his masterwork <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Foundations of Futures Studies.</emphasis> Here he suggested that:<br/>Human societies and cultures have many features in common. ... Near-universals do not exist by chance. ... They give us insight about which values may have contributed to the survival and flourishing of human societies over the long haul of human evolution (Bell, 1997, 171).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref60025\"/>He continues by discussing four values that he considers of major importance: 'knowledge, evaluation, justice and cooperation.' He also mentions those from a survey carried out by Kidder: 'love, truthfulness, fairness, freedom, unity, tolerance, responsibility and respect for life' (Bell, 1997, 181). Taken out of context such lists mean very little but they do indicate general orientations that have been highly regarded by most cultures over long periods of time.

Doing right flows from a rational belief in the validity of universal moral principles and having a personal commitment to them.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 5</emphasis>: A rational obligation to be impartial in upholding values and trustworthy in fulfilling voluntarily made contracts, recognising that some general rights such as life and liberty transcend law and majority opinion. Doing right is both fulfilling one's freely agree to obligations and a rational calculation of the greatest good for the greatest number.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 4</emphasis>: A concern with larger social institutions and society as a whole. Doing right is fulfilling one's obligations and being concerned about the welfare of the group.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 3</emphasis>: The need to be a good person in your own and others' eyes. Being mutually loyal... Doing right is living up to the expectations of others.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 2</emphasis>: Serving one's own needs or interests while recognising other people's needs or interests. Doing the right thing still depends on external authority.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 1</emphasis>: Obedience and the avoidance of punishment. Doing right depends on external authority. (Bell, 1997, p. 218)</p><p><anchor id=\"ref60030\"/>It is for the reader to consider the how well or badly the values and human qualities suggested here may apply to specific individuals and organisations that have colonised the Internet for their own limited purposes. But at the very least Bell and Kohlberg provide us with clear and reliable criteria that can legitimately be used as an evaluative scale. So in terms of moral development thus defined, some organisations and their executive leaders may find themselves hard pressed to provide adequate answers. Which has huge social implications. When the question of re-negotiating social contracts is raised - and it will be repeatedly - then interlocutors can legitimately seek evidence for the fulfilment of these criteria at the highest levels. Possibly the most useful guidance and overall summary is provided by Bell himself when he suggests that 'People live best who live for others as well as for themselves' (Bell, 1997, 275). Finally <link><marker>Fig. 6</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60030\"/></link> summarises some of the key suggestions made throughout this series back to an Integral perspective.<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference60030\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref60030\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr6SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr6LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 6 - Humanising and democratising IT.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p>A straightforward four-quadrant analysis illustrates how various right hand quadrant phenomena (including technology, infrastructure and exterior actions) can usefully be related back to various left hand quadrant equivalents (values, worldviews, stages of development etc. as expressed through a variety of cultural norms and conditions). It follows that one way of promoting more humanised and democratic uses of any technology is to simply open to these left-hand quadrant realities and take them fully into account.</p><p>This series has shown how the early Internet was shaped and conditioned by specific human and cultural forces within the U.S. After a fairly benign, government-funded start, a handful of entrepreneurs took over and, with little or no thought for wider consequences, actively fashioned the conditions for their own success. Tax laws were revised. Anti-trust regulations that had earlier been applied to Microsoft and the Bell Telephone Company were set aside. Strategies were undertaken through which private monopoly platforms would grow unhindered into the world-spanning behemoths of today. The rise of neoliberalism then turbo-charged this process. Following Hayek it viewed the government as an impediment to 'progress' and the market as an unquestioned good. These tendencies, along with Rand's nihilistic view of human existence, all helped to bring the present constellation of rootless and invasive entities to its present condition.</p><p>In an alternative world, competent far-sighted governance would have set the conditions for such enterprises and modified them progressively over time. Human rights (including the right to dignity, privacy and freedom from oppression) would have been respected and consciously built into the foundations of the Internet. Corporations would have learned to respect users and therefore to ask before expropriating creative work and private data wholesale for commercial gain. Tax laws that mediated fairly between corporate and social needs would have helped to ensure a steady flow of income for social expenditures. When entities grew too large they would have been broken up or otherwise compelled to adapt. Currently, however, we do not live in that world.</p><p>Yet, as can be seen from some of the many examples outlined above, there are a host of reasons to support informed optimism and hope, the framing of real solutions. Furthermore, it is helpful to remember that some aspects of our situation are by not entirely new. When Martin Luther hammered a copy of his 93 theses onto the Wittenberg church door some five centuries ago, he set himself against the oligarch of the day - the all-powerful Catholic Church. He questioned the legitimacy of that vast institution and, at the same time, began a process that both destroyed its business model and made way for alternatives. Today the underlying dynamic is suggestive but there are also clear differences. Luther's stripped down version of Christianity was a radical change but it still provided people with a sturdy moral framework to guide their thinking and behaviour. Such foundational certainties are more elusive in our own time. On the other hand this very fact arguably provides a rationale for recovering, re-valuing and applying some of the universal human values outlined above. The latter are perhaps among the most viable sources of strength and continuity available during times of transformation and change.</p><p>The legitimacy of the Internet oligarchs is now in doubt from many quarters and for a variety of reasons, so limits are likely to be imposed. Similarly, the business model that daily abuses countless human beings is unlikely to survive without major changes being wrought by newly enfranchised, democratically constituted cooperatives and civil authorities. While government actions may be slow and, at times uncertain, this study has shown that a host of responses, innovations and alternatives is under active development. It is inconceivable that these will not change the nature of digital engagement over time. So it is indeed possible to look ahead with qualified optimism and to anticipate a new and different renaissance. It is one that sets aside technological adventurism and wild, unconstrained innovation, in favour of positive human values and cultural traditions that balance human dignity and rights on the one hand with the enhanced stewardship of natural systems on the other.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Notes</emphasis></h><p>The author would like to thank reviewer 1 for his extensive comments and contributions to the text.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOOTNOTES</emphasis></h><p>The task of grasping some of the interior aspects of social change in the post WW2 era was taken up by interdisciplinary scholars such as Lewis Mumford, Hannah Arendt, Ulrich Beck, Zigmunt Bauman and Jurgen Habermas, among many others. More recent perspectives shedding further light on these matters include accounts of hypernormality (<link><marker>Hooton, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0145\"/></link>), anticipation theory (<link><marker>Poli, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0255\"/></link>), the 'de-growth' movement (<link><marker>Cattaneo et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0065\"/></link>; <link><marker>Videira et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0380\"/></link>) postnormal studies (<link><marker>Sardar, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0280\"/></link>) new economic paradigms (<link><marker>Raworth, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0260\"/></link>) and the wider use of Integral methods (<link><marker>van Egmond &amp; de Vries, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0375\"/></link>).</p><p>The idea that repressing or turning away from human qualities and social phenomena is exceptionally damaging receives powerful support from Masha Gessen in her book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Future is History</emphasis> (<link><marker>Gessen, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0100\"/></link>). Here she shows in tragic detail how, in the decades following the 1917 October revolution, Russian society and its people were radically diminished by the withdrawal of official support for, and interest in, questions of values, personal wellbeing and social coherence. Much of the substance of human and social life drained away with tragic consequences. With neither the language nor conceptual ability to come to grips with their condition the population was unable to grasp or improve it.</p><p>'Social interests' in the sense Greenfield is using the term refers more to a notion of 'economic beneficiary' than Habermas more encompassing and philosophical usage. Yet the two usages are arguably related.</p><p>In 2015 John Naughton reported on work by Doc Searles on what he calls the 'intention economy.' Of direct relevance to the issue of there being human interests beyond the purely technical is the following view. Namely that 'many market problems ... can only be solved from the customer side: by making the customer a fully-empowered actor in the market place, rather than one whose power in many cases is dependent upon exclusive relationships with vendors, by coerced agreement provided entirely by those vendors' (<link><marker>Naughton, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0230\"/></link>).</p><p>A decisive move away from neoliberal assumptions and practices would arguably do more than almost any other measure to facilitate these tasks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><bibliography><bodyText><p><anchor id=\"reference0005\"/><link><marker>Ahmed, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref0005\"/></link> N.

Introduction</emphasis></h><p>The first paper in this series explored several accounts of the IT revolution. Of particular interest was the contrast between those who framed this process in terms of positive outcomes and those who consider that it has been subverted by powerful actors especially in Silicon Valley. The second paper considered two case studies: the Internet of Things (IoT) and the projected rise of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). It briefly employed Integral concepts to identify values and worldviews that appear to characterise leading figures within the IT industry. These interior human characteristics arguably have powerful consequences yet have been widely overlooked in high-tech environments. It concluded that, on the whole, and notwithstanding some obvious practical gains, there is evidence to support the view that the Internet has been undermined and compromised by the power, wealth and reach of vast monopoly enterprises. Yet the second paper also suggested that multiple solutions, or ways forward, already exist in embryo and many more are sure to emerge. So the third and final paper considers ways of challenging the current status quo, of revising assumptions and re-designing (or re-purposing) the Internet and associated IT applications towards more egalitarian and socially viable ends. These are huge and complex topics that shift and change almost daily. So it should be appreciated that a concise account such as this cannot be other than a work in progress.</p><p>The first section picks up the central theme of the series by focusing on ill-considered or compulsive innovation. It questions fatalistic attitudes and argues that, far from being inevitable, concerns such as artificial intelligence (AI) or Chinese surveillance practices need to be brought more fully into the open and subjected to sustained critical enquiry. The rest of the paper takes up the theme of recovery and renewal. Some critical 'blind spots' are briefly outlined (a distinct lack of interest in global challenges; a pervasive tendency to under-value 'the social') and reframed in more positive terms. The notion of 'constitutive human interests' is raised. It's here that the implications of the project become more obvious since many of the concerns raised can also be viewed as positive opportunities for productive innovation and adaptive change.</p><p>A variety of innovations for better managing IT-related innovations and re-purposing the Internet are subsequently discussed. They include working with three scales of innovation, taming algorithms and supporting human agency. The innovation theme continues in the following chapter where wider questions about social democracy, new infrastructure and regulation are discussed. Finally we return to the question of 're-humanising' the IT revolution. Here the discussion includes notions of the public good, moral universals (and their lack) and the vexed, ever-present question of the sheer ambiguity of unconstrained and rapid technical innovation. The overall conclusions of this paper, and indeed, of the whole project, are framed by a growing imperative to 'disrupt the disruptors' by investing in socially democratic actions and processes across the board. These could include changing the terms of business to rein in the oligarchs, breaking up monopolies (or re-constituting them as public utilities), subjecting proposed high-tech innovations to greater informed scrutiny, building new civic infrastructure and supporting the development of further IT capabilities in the public, as opposed to private, interest.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Compulsive innovation</emphasis></h><p><br/>'You can't stop progress'</p><p>One of the themes that emerges from this enquiry is the need and opportunity for large-scale, democratically mediated social design and a commitment to long-term social innovation in the public interest. At first sight it may appear difficult to see how the motivation for such efforts could arise or from whom. But these are early days and motivation can emerge from a variety of sources. To begin with, in a context of radically ambiguous technical innovation, with its accompanying upheavals and disruptions the widely held, but ultimately fatalistic, view that 'you can't stop progress' clearly lacks credibility and should be set aside. Modifying this slightly to 'you can't stop technical innovation' is a small step forward but doesn't take us very far. Of far greater value is a more nuanced understanding of what terms such as 'progress' and 'innovation' actually mean, what values they spring from, whose interests are represented (or extinguished) and what longer term impacts and consequences may plausibly occur.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0195\"/>Such issues are hardly the stuff of common conversation but if society is to regain any say at all in its own prospects they need to be brought to full awareness and debated much more widely. Similarly, the social, political, technical and environmental consequences of neo-liberal formulas, of economic growth as the primary goal along with ever more extreme inequality are no longer in doubt. They are writ large throughout the world. People are becoming ever more concerned about these issues and, moreover, the Earth system itself is responding to multiple human impacts with glacially slow, but unstoppable, momentum. Notions of 'progress' in this context clearly need to be unpacked as they are fraught with ambiguity and increasingly divorced from genuine human interests (<link><marker>Metcalf, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0195\"/></link>). Australia's Gold Coast illustrates this dilemma rather well. Here an immodest, high-rise 'glitter strip' devoted to pleasure seeking and escapism emerges from the edge of a vast ocean that could - and almost certainly will - overpower it at any time. Viewed from above or from the ocean the hubris inherent in these structures becomes obvious. (<link><marker>Fig. 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60005\"/></link>) All it will take to shatter the illusion is increased beach erosion, the steady rise of sea levels, a strong storm surge or perhaps a wayward cyclone. The mode of development on open display is a living testament to a worldview characterised by profit-seeking, denial and short-termism. These are not characteristics that bode well for the future (<link><marker>Slaughter, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0315\"/></link>).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference60005\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref60005\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr1SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr1LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 1 - High-rise hubris, Gold Coast, Australia.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p><anchor id=\"ref0225\"/>'Progress' is often seen as synonymous with technical innovation but such notions do not withstand close scrutiny. Similarly, a continuing free-for-all dialectic of innovation and counter innovation quickly becomes irrational in our currently divided world. In what may be an inexact but tellingly perverse reversal of Moore's Law the stakes grow ever more extreme with each new level of technical capability. Yet business leaders and decision makers seem largely unaware of this. We can see this in the current breakout of IT company investments in powerful real-world applications such as automation and advanced robotics that look set to destroy most, if not all, semi-skilled jobs (<link><marker>Murphy, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0225\"/></link>). We see it in the irrationality of emerging autonomous weapon systems (<link><marker>Begley &amp; Wroe, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0025\"/></link>). We also see it on the mid-term horizon in the systemic threats that plausibly arise from quantum computing (<link><marker>Majot &amp; Yampolskiy, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0185\"/></link>). A more immediate example is the rise of GPS spoofing. The early development of this technology was undoubtedly useful as it introduced precise, reliable navigation into countless transportation applications. Now certain features in its design are being quite deliberately employed to disable it. According to reports anomalous results were first spotted by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PokemonGo</emphasis> players near sensitive sites in Moscow and then began appearing elsewhere. For example, alarms began to sound when the master of a ship in the Black Sea discovered that his position was over 30\u202fkm away from where it was supposed to be. Russia is thought to be one entity experimenting with the technology. But of equal or perhaps greater concern is that spoofing software can now be downloaded from the Internet and employed by anyone with the knowledge and will to do so (<link><marker>Hambling, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0125\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0365\"/>A similar dialectic is can be seen in countless other examples, sometimes even in advance. Actively scanning the environment for signals of change does, in theory, provide time to respond. Separate scanning hits may interact to reveal previously hidden possibilities. For example, public media announce that trials of driverless 'autonomous vehicles' (AVs) will occur along a public motorway. A UK Minister of Transport announces that AVs will be in use by 2021 (<link><marker>Topham, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0365\"/></link>). Such developments are now becoming technically feasible. Yet around the same time a radical group publishes details about how, with a little imagination, vehicle-derailing devices can be easily and cheaply constructed and set in place leaving those responsible to disappear without trace (<link><marker>Thiessen, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0360\"/></link>). Little imagination is required to suggest that both high-, and low-tech devices will be developed to intervene and disrupt the smooth operation of AV technology wherever it is deployed. Once again we are reminded that new technologies are never 'value free;' they always come with hidden weaknesses and costs, winners and 'losers'. Those who put their faith in complex systems will eventually need to recognise that the latter are not infallible. Those with different values and what one might call 'oppositional' social interests will continue to take advantage of any weaknesses or blind spots (<link><marker>Bartlett, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0020\"/></link>). It follows that the 'hidden', non-material side of any technology is at least as significant as its physical form. It therefore requires much closer attention.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.1. Artificial intelligence</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0035\"/>Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking are among many who have warned of the dangers of artificial intelligence (AI) and the very real possibility that it may represent an existential threat to humanity. Fresh impetus to this debate was provided when Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk clashed over this issue (<link><marker>Biggs, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0035\"/></link>). While Musk echoed previously expressed concerns, Zuckerberg would have none of it. For him such talk was 'negative' and 'irresponsible.' He's dead against any 'call for a slowdown in progress' with AI (<link><marker>Frier, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0095\"/></link>). So it fell to director James Cameron, director of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Terminator 2</emphasis> and other movie blockbusters, to inject some reality into the proceedings by reminding everyone of the mammoth in the room. Namely that it is '<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">market forces</emphasis> (that) have put us into runaway climate change, and the sixth mass extinction.' He then added that 'we don't seem to have any great skill at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> experimenting on ourselves in completely unprecedented ways' (<link><marker>Maddox, 2017, emphases added</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0175\"/></link>).</p><p>What is significant here is that it falls to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a movie director</emphasis> to draw attention to links between the products of an advanced techno-economic system and the growing likelihood of irrational outcomes. Such concerns are fundamental to the maintenance of public safety and wellbeing. Yet, as was pointed out in an earlier paper, careful consideration of the social implications of technical change by public authorities has declined even as the need for it has increased. The race to create artificial intelligence is being pursued in many places. Yet up to this point few of the key players have appeared willing to pull back and rigorously assess the risks or seek guidance from wider constituencies. For East or West to passively 'follow the technology wherever it leads' is technological determinism writ large. It's clearly an inadequate basis upon which to make decisions, let alone to gamble with the future of humanity.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0050\"/>We cannot assume that advanced AI will take over the world and either destroy humanity or render it redundant. Such outcomes are certainly possible but there are genuine differences of opinion on these very questions (<link><marker>Brooks, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0050\"/></link>; <link><marker>Caughill, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0070\"/></link>). Of more immediate concern is that various agencies have been looking to AI for military and security 'solutions' for some years. Roboticised figures have been common in the entertainment industry for several decades (<link><marker>Fig. 2</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60010\"/></link>). But wider appreciation of risks involved in their use in real-world situations has been minimal thus far. Now, however, robot soldiers are being designed and tested. At the time of writing, for example, a group called the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots was meeting at the United Nations in New York. Part of the program included a film illustrating the potential of 'assassin drones' to sweep into a crowded area, identify targets using facial recognition, apply lethal force and vanish. Concerned scientists were attempting to 'highlight the dangers of developing autonomous weapons that can find, track and fire on targets without human supervision' (<link><marker>Sample, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0275\"/></link>). This may sound like science fiction (SF) but a leading AI scientist offered at least two reasons for believing that such devices are closer than one might think. In their view:<br/>The technology illustrated in the film is simply an integration of existing capabilities. It is not science fiction. In fact, it is easier to achieve than self-driving cars, which require far higher standards of performance. (Also) because AI-powered machines are relatively cheap to manufacture, critics fear that autonomous weapons could be mass produced and fall into the hands of rogue nations or terrorists who could use them to suppress populations and wreak havoc (<link><marker>Sample, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0275\"/></link>)<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference60010\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref60010\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr2SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr2LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 2 - Augmented and robot figures as entertainment.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p>This is merely one branch of a rapidly evolving area of research and innovation but the prospects are clearly terrifying. They also raise another key question: who or what locus of authority provided the green light to arms manufacturers, the disruptors of Silicon Valley, or indeed anyone else to carry out these unprecedented experiments? Reinventing the world in a high-tech era - whether by innovation or disruption or both - is a non-trivial matter. To routinely and relentlessly create quite new dangers and hazards cannot do other than threaten the viability of humanity and social life. Yet somehow these entities continue to operate openly and with confidence, yet lacking anything remotely like a social license. Some consider that the development of AI could be <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the</emphasis> test case that decides the matter for once and for all. Here is Taplin again on how what he regards as the benign legacy of Engelbart - an Internet pioneer - was turned toward darker ends. He writes that the latter 'saw the computer as primarily a tool to augment - not replace - human capability'. And yet 'in our current era, by contrast, much of the financing flowing out of Silicon Valley is aimed at building machines that can replace humans' (Taplin, 2017, p. 55). At this point, and to anticipate a theme considered below, the ghost of Habermas might well be heard whispering something along the lines of 'whatever happened to our communicative and emancipatory interests?' To what extent does their absence from dominant technical discourses mean they are also missing from the products and outcomes they produce?</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.2. The panopticon returns</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0385\"/>The original panopticon as envisaged by Jeremy Bentham in the 18th Century was a design for a prison in which all the inmates could be continuously monitored without their knowledge. Since they could never know whether they were being observed or not they were constrained to act as if they were at all times. Hence they became adept at controlling their own behaviour (<link><marker>Wikipedia, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0385\"/></link>). During recent years newer versions have arisen that bring this oppressive model to mind. One is in China; the other much more widely distributed. Chinese intentions to use IT for social control are revealed by Paul Mozur in Shanghai. He writes that:<br/>China's ambitions with AI range from the anodyne to the dystopian, according to the new plan. It calls for support for everything from agriculture and medicine to manufacturing. Yet it also calls for the technology to work in concert with homeland security and surveillance efforts. China wants to integrate AI into guided missiles, use it to track people on closed-circuit cameras, censor the Internet and even predict crimes (<link><marker>Mozur, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0220\"/></link>).</p><p>This may not seem like a particularly significant departure from what's already occurring elsewhere. What is different is that China already has totalitarian tendencies since it is ruled by an inflexible party machine that shows no interest in human rights or related democratic norms. While the US has itself long been hamstrung by deadlocked and ineffectual governments it does have a constitution that protects certain core rights (such as free speech). Despite systematic predation (through copyright theft and monopoly power) by Internet oligarchs, the US also retains elements of a free press and it certainly has an independent judiciary. Furthermore, the European Economic Community (EEC) has already taken the first steps to establishing a more credible regime of regulation. In so doing it has shown that it is willing and able to take on the Internet oligarchs and force them to change their behaviour. So in the West there are real prospects of reining in at least some of the excesses.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0155\"/>But China is a very different story. According to reports its oppressive 'grid system' of systematic surveillance has been operating in Beijing since 2007. Aspects of this oppressive new system were summarised as long ago as 2013 in a Human Rights Report. For example:<br/>The new grid system divides the neighborhoods and communities into smaller units, each with a team of at least five administrative and security staff. In some Chinese cities the new grid units are as small as 5 or 10 households, each with a \"grid captain\" and a delegated system of collective responsibility ... Grid management is specifically intended to facilitate information-gathering by enabling disparate sources into a single, accessible and digitized system for use by officials. ... In Tibet the Party Secretary told officials that 'we must implement the urban grid management system. The key elements are focusing on ... really implementing grid management in all cities and towns, putting a dragnet into place to maintain stability. ... By 2012 the pilot system was in 'full swing' (as it had stored) nearly 10,000 basic data' (and collected) hundreds of pieces of information about conditions of the people (<link><marker>Human Rights Watch, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0155\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0305\"/>By 2015 this vast modern panopticon was ready to be rolled out to enable the full-on mass surveillance of China's 1. 4 billion citizens. Another report noted that:<br/>It envisages a national population database linking people's compulsory identity cards with their credit histories, travel records, hotel registrations and social security details. Police and state security agencies will have access to every aspect of a person's life at the click of a keyboard and everyone will be issued with a single 'all-in-one' identity card (<link><marker>Sheridan, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0305\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0045\"/>Since then further details of this oppressive and inescapable surveillance system have emerged. For example a Wired article by Rachel Botsman revealed that two Chinese data giants - China Rapid Finance and Sesame Credit - had been commissioned by the government to create the required infrastructure using copious amounts of big data. Free access to this vast resource means that people can be monitored, rated and evaluated in depth throughout their normal lives. It turns out that 'individuals on Sesame Credit are measured by a score ranging between 350 and 950 points.' While the algorithms remain secret the five factors employed are not - credit history, fulfilment capacity (or ability to abide by contractual arrangements), personal characteristics, behaviour and preferences and, finally, interpersonal relationships. Those with high scores get consumer choices, easy credit and the chance to travel; those with low scores become the new underclass with few meaningful choices at all. These are described as 'private platforms acting essentially as spy agencies for the government.' The author then adds that 'the government is attempting to make obedience feel like gaming. It is a method of social control dressed up in some points-reward system. It's gamified obedience' (<link><marker>Botsman, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0045\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0100\"/>What's particularly curious here is the inevitability of non-trivial perverse outcomes, foremost among which are the immense cultural and human costs. Masha Gessen's mesmerising and sometimes painful account of life in post-revolutionary Russia clearly demonstrates how hard it is to imagine that a cowed and passive population could retain sufficient awareness or creativity to contribute much of value to any culture, however instrumentally powerful it may appear (<link><marker>Gessen, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0100\"/></link>). In Botsman's view 'where these systems really descend into nightmarish territory is that the trust algorithms used are unfairly reductive. They don't take into account context.' Yet without a keen sense of context meaning becomes free-floating and elusive. Finally there's the inevitable emergence of 'reputation black markets selling under-the-counter ways to boost trustworthiness' (<link><marker>Botsman, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0045\"/></link>). Overall, this may turn out to be the world's prime contemporary example of a 'deformed future' in the making.</p><p>A second and equally subversive example is found in the growing use of voice-activated 'digital assistants' over the last few years. Skillfully packaged as mere 'assistants' and 'helpers' they are 'on' all the time and thus set to respond to every request and whim. Some of are equipped with female voices that are intended to exert a distinctly seductive effect as shown in Spike Jonez 2013 film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Her</emphasis>. What is less obvious (at least to the user) is that with each and every use the individuals concerned reveal ever more information about their not-so-private lives. Before long comprehensive profiles are assembled, preferences noted and rich fields of data produced.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0010\"/>As things currently stand, the operators of these systems own this treasure trove of information outright. They are then able to poke, prod and suggest new products and services in the light of those already consumed. Sales go up but consumers become ever more tightly bound to their own induced impulses and proclivities. Thus, instead of having open-ended learning experiences, of responding to challenges, of deepening their knowledge and understanding of their own authentic needs and human qualities, those who succumb can end up having 'feelings' for, and an ersatz fictional bond to, a remote impersonal network that exists only to exploit them. A further consequence of becoming over-reliant on such 'immersive' technologies is that the real-world skills and capacities of human beings start to atrophy. Memory, time keeping, spatial awareness are among the capabilities that wind down over time leaving people ever more dependent and at risk (<link><marker>Aitkin, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0010\"/></link>). In this case, as in many others, people are seduced into becoming a core component of the 'product' being sold. As the human interiors shrink and fall away, identity itself becomes elusive and problematic.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0165\"/>In summary, leaving the high-tech disruptors in any field to their own devices, so to speak, simply means that the human enterprise is subjected to random shocks and abuses that end up placing it in ever-greater peril. For Naomi Klein this is part of a deliberate playbook designed to provide a minority with greater dominance and power (<link><marker>Klein, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0165\"/></link>). But it's also the result of a certain kind of blindness that comes from over-valuing the technical and under-valuing the human and the social. If there's a consistent theme here it's that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">power in the wrong hands creates more problems than it solves</emphasis>. So high-tech innovation needs to be separated from simple notions of 'progress.' It is fundamentally a question of values and power - instrumental, cultural and symbolic. If humanity is to have any change of avoiding Dystopian outcomes human societies will need find new ways to own their own power and give only such of it as they judge necessary to governance structures that meet their real needs. Another way of saying this is that it's time to disrupt the disruptors. They've had their moment in the sun and the clouds are gathering. It's time for them to stand aside so that a different world can emerge.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Blind spots as opportunities</emphasis></h><p>It has been suggested throughout this enquiry that worldview limitations are complicit in supporting a kind of widely shared and selective blindness that prevents many of the key players from perceiving what is strikingly obvious to others. Three brief examples are provided here. One concerns the implications of Earth changes now under way. Another is how unthinking commitments to empiricism, technical determinism and neoliberalism have eroded key modalities of human and social existence. Finally there is a significant, but seldom appreciated, underlying concern regarding the nature and implications of constitutive human interests.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.1. Global context, global limits, global action</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0140\"/>Macro views of the contradictory and unsustainable condition of human civilisation have gained little or no traction with US corporations, the giants of Silicon Valley and their wealthy associates. This 'condition' obviously has multiple facets and there are many ways of coming to grips with it. For some observers a primary concern is the way humanity has laid waste to natural resources as a consequence of having outgrown the physical capacities of the global environment (<link><marker>Higgs, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0140\"/></link>). In this view issues around global warming, the scarcity of fresh water and the sixth extinction loom large. The accumulation of planetary impacts has given rise to the term 'Anthropocene' or era of human-related changes (<link><marker>Carrington, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0060\"/></link>; <link><marker>Slaughter, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0310\"/></link>; <link><marker>Steffen et al., 2015a</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0340\"/></link>). The term has slowly become accepted over recent years as those dedicated to 'Earth science' have provided numerous insights into the nature of large-scale processes of change.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0345\"/>Well-grounded knowledge about changing parameters of the global living space available to humans and other species has become both plentiful and increasingly reliable. It has, for example, provided valuable inputs to policy and decision-making at all levels. Work by Steffen and others on planetary boundaries is of particular salience (<link><marker>Steffen et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0340\"/></link><link><marker>Steffen et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0345\"/></link><link><marker>Steffen et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0335\"/></link>; <link><marker>Stockholm Research Centre, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0350\"/></link>). It shows how humanity has exceeded safe limits in three areas (flows of phosphorus and of nitrogen; loss of genetic diversity) and is set to exceed them in two others (land system change and climate change). Yet vital global concerns of this kind are not only widely overlooked by many high-tech entrepreneurs they are also actively denied by some of their most wealthy backers (<link><marker>Mayer, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0190\"/></link>). The very last thing the latter are prepared to recognise is the reality of global limits (<link><marker>Higgs, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0140\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0200\"/>Coming to grips with limits, the extent of human impacts and the choices and options available to humanity also provide many positive opportunities. Among these is the increased breadth and capability that flows from adopting more progressive values and broader, more inclusive worldviews (see below). Taking global issues seriously then opens up a plethora of actions and strategies that, properly understood, significantly enhances our individual and collective ability to navigate through the rough weather that undoubtedly lies ahead (<link><marker>Monbiot, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0200\"/></link>; <link><marker>Raworth, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0260\"/></link>). The New Economy Network Australia (NENA) is one of many organisations that demonstrate in practical terms how new economic structures and processes can be created both with, and without, official sanction (<link><marker>NENA, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0245\"/></link>). Other examples are discussed below.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.2. Re-valuing the human and social interiors</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref60015\"/>The empirical-analytic methods employed to create powerful technologies and to understand track macro phenomena both emerge from the 'exterior collective' quadrant of Integral enquiry. Yet taken in isolation they cannot grasp the nature of related human and cultural realities since they spring from very different sources and invoke different kinds of knowledge. Integral perspectives seek greater balance by adding an 'interior' dimension to both individual and collective phenomena (<link><marker>Fig. 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60015\"/></link>). The general lack of such distinctions helps explain (and indeed to resolve) some of the confusion and conflict that occurs when, for example, new waves of high-tech innovation (exterior collective) impact on human life worlds (interior individual) and pre-existing ways of life (interior collective). As noted, people, social systems and cultures are all deeply affected. Jobs are destroyed, professions disappear and machines primed to take over operations that were previously understood to exist solely within the domain of human action. Yet the study of history, the foundations of personhood, society and culture are only marginally accessible to empirical enquiry and are therefore routinely dismissed. Which is not to say that they cannot be studied and understood by those with the requisite skills, insight and methods (<link><marker>Esbjorn-Hargens, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0090\"/></link>).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference60015\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref60015\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr3SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr3LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p><anchor id=\"ref0300\"/>Fig. 3 - Four quadrants of Integral enquiry (<link><marker>Slaughter, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0300\"/></link>).</p></caption></nitf:media></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.3. Constitutive human interests</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref60020\"/>German philosopher Jurgen Habermas produced a series of works that made significant demands on readers yet also produced insights of continuing value. Of direct relevance here is his account of 'constitutive human interests.' Unlike much of his work the essence of such interests are easily grasped and usefully illuminate a number of vital social processes that tend to be overlooked in high-tech environments. <link><marker>Fig. 4</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60020\"/></link> provides an outline of Habermas theory. In this account, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the technical interest</emphasis> relates to 'work' and the empirical/analytic sciences that are centrally concerned with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">production and control</emphasis> (i.e. the application of technical rules to instrumental problems). <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The practical interest</emphasis> is about human interaction. Here the concern is not with control, nor with technical processes, but with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">communication and understanding</emphasis>, both of which are grounded in language and culture. The point is to clarify the conditions for clear and unobstructed communication between participating subjects. These are seen as interpretive tasks requiring appropriate skills. The third and perhaps 'highest' interest is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the emancipatory interest</emphasis>.

Rather, what he is set against is the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">over-extension</emphasis> of the technical into areas that he considers illegitimate - as, for example, when decisions about new technologies are made on the basis of 'can it be done?' rather than 'should it be done?' One is a pragmatic issue concerned with technique; the other is value-laden and grounded in ethical considerations. This distinction has been widely overlooked in the present context. Then concerning the practical interest, there are many non-technical factors (such as power, ideology, marketing and direct exploitation) that impede and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">prevent</emphasis> true communication taking place between individuals and groups. The issue then becomes that of defining the conditions under which communication can be optimised. This again is not a technical question but one that relates to the richer and more complex world of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">human intersubjectivity</emphasis>. Finally, the emancipatory interest is engaged in the critique of domination, repression, mystification and institutional inertia. It tries to define the conditions within which people can create <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">an authentic existence</emphasis> for themselves.</p><p>Unfortunately however, questions of limits, of the character and requirements of 'the social' and the whole question of underlying human interests - actual human needs and qualities - mean little or nothing to techno-enthusiasts and Internet entrepreneurs. As we've seen their speech patterns, metaphors, discourses were, and remain, focused on the single-minded pursuit of power, exploitation, expansion and accumulation of immense financial rewards. These features go a long way towards explaining why the Internet and many associated technologies became debased and also why they parted company from authentic human and social needs. The rise of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">homo economicus</emphasis> and the rapid expansion of humanly arid technical systems could not but produce a generalised Dystopian sense that human affairs were spinning out of control. During the second decade of the 21st Century traditional research, scholarship and the scientific method itself were also being undermined by the diminished rationality of technical innovation coupled with denialism on an astonishing scale. Moreover, the tendency of traditional disciplines toward subject compartmentalism made it difficult to address the growing complexities of macro-change.

So long as their own innovations made it to market, these 'straws in the wind' were held to be of little significance. A variety of non-empirical and broad-based approaches to understanding were quietly developing in the background.

Interior drivers, scales of implementation</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0135\"/>Virtually everyone outside the Silicon Valley bubble who has paused to consider the complex tangle of issues thrown up by the IT revolution in general and the Internet in particular tends, at some point, to reach a key conclusion - that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the key issues before us are not primarily technical</emphasis>. Technology provides the physical substrate and software an artificial 'nervous system' that reaches ever more deeply into human lives. But merely following technical capabilities as far as they can be driven appears to confine humanity on a fast train to Dystopia and perhaps the end of human civilisation itself. Juval Harari unintentionally provided a rehearsal, or test case, for that thesis in his book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Homo Deus</emphasis> (<link><marker>Harari, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0135\"/></link>). Here the main driver of change was considered to be the ingenuity of large groups of people and their most significant achievements, indeed, are said to be those associated with high technology. Yet by relentlessly following this technologically determinist path the outlook for what the author refers to as 'unaugmented' humans is that they are expected to fall by the wayside and become the 'road kill' of history. It is severe and uncompromising conclusion but consistent with the starting assumptions. If, on the other hand, the uses of high-tech are shaped and conditioned by progressive social drivers - such as life-affirming values and expanded worldviews - the outcomes would certainly be very different. So in playing a reductionist game with the very forces that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">moderate</emphasis> raw technical power - language, values, worldviews and similar culturally derived sources of meaning and capability - Harari actually demonstrates how vitally necessary they really are (<link><marker>Slaughter, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0320\"/></link>). Nor is this the only source that confirms this vital insight.10</p><p>There are clearly many aspects to this story and a growing number of informed observers of this rapidly changing scene. As mentioned in the previous paper, Greenfield views the IT revolution less as an overwhelming success than a full-on invasion. So he seeks to explore the implications of what he regards as 'the colonisation of everyday life by information processing.' As with other critical approaches he is interested not merely in raw outcomes but also in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">motives</emphasis> of promoters, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ideas</emphasis> behind the hardware and the social <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">interests</emphasis> involved.15 Working at a more fine-grained level and acknowledging such interests helps to re-frame core assumptions within corporate and business environments.20</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0110\"/>Greenfield considers the Internet of Things (IoT) at three scales of implementation: the human body (or the 'quantified self'), the home environment (or 'smart home') and public spaces (the 'smart city') (<link><marker>Greenfield, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0110\"/></link>). Such terms are already in wide circulation but Greenfield wants to probe more deeply into what they mean through actual case studies. As noted above, the marketing of high-tech devices commonly highlight assumed benefits to users but obscure underlying corporate benefits. So at the individual human scale biometric devices such as the Fitbit and the Apple Watch monitor a variety of health and fitness indices. Yet once again the flows of personal data are valued, analysed and used as inputs to advertising and sales. Insurance companies have obvious interests in these skewed transactions and some offer reductions in premiums in exchange for such personal data. Truck and public service drivers are especially vulnerable to the imposition of more heavy-handed versions. Then, unless this trend is halted, the intensive collection of personal data may be required of all drivers and other persons responsible for vehicles and related machinery. The logical end point of this insidious process is nothing less than the imposition of total surveillance.</p><p>At the scale of housing, 'smart homes' are beginning to be promoted on grounds of safety, security and convenience. But the rise of home-based 'digital assistants' requires careful consideration. Greenfield notes that 'although the choices these ... offer to us are presented as neutral, they are built on numerous inbuilt assumptions that many of us would question if we were to truly scrutinise them'. In relation to Amazon's rapid order 'dash button', for example, he adds:<br/>The benefit to the individual customer is tiny compared with what Amazon gains. Sure, you never run out of cat food. But Amazon gets data on the time and place of your need, as well as its frequency and intensity, and that data has value. It is an asset, and you can be sure that Amazon will exploit it in every way its terms and conditions permit - including by using it to develop behavioural models that map our desires in high resolution, so as to target them with even greater efficiency in the future (<link><marker>Greenfield, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0110\"/></link>).</p><p>Then, in relation to the IoT and at the scale of the 'smart city' Greenfield identifies core elements of what he calls the 'guiding ideology' of the Internet. It employs decontextualised and stripped down notions of language and meaning that preclude features such as uncertainty and interpretation. In such a view the world appears 'perfectly knowable' which implies that technical systems can encode it 'without bias or distortion.' Consequently, when applied to cities:<br/>This is effectively an argument that there is one and only one correct solution to each identified need; that this solution can be arrived at algorithmically, via the operations of a technical system furnished with the proper inputs; and that this solution is something that can be encoded in public policy, without distortion (<link><marker>Greenfield, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0110\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0040\"/>That these observations are not merely theoretical is confirmed by the emergence of 'Google Urbanism,' an ambitious plan by the company's Alphabet subsidiary to reconfigure cities in its own image. Its pilot project on the Toronto waterfront seeks to 'reimagine urban life in five dimensions - housing, energy, mobility, social services and shared public spaces.' But what is causing most concern is a proposed 'data-harvesting, wi-fi beaming digital layer' that would provide a 'single unified source of information about what is going on.' This would gather 'an astonishing level of detail' such that 'each passing footstep and bicycle tire could be accounted for and managed.' Issues of privacy and the blurring of public and private interests may be trumped, however, by the suspicion that 'the role of technology in urban life is obvious: It is a money-maker' (<link><marker>Bliss, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0040\"/></link>). For Morozov, ever on the alert for new forms of Internet solutionism, such heavy-handed developments signal 'the end of politics.' He comments that:<br/>Even neoliberal luminaries like Friedrich Hayek allowed for some non-market forms of social organisation in the urban domain. They saw planning as a necessity imposed by the physical limitations of urban spaces: there was no other cheap way of operating infrastructure, building streets, avoiding congestion. For Alphabet, these constraints are no more: continuous data flows can replace government rules with market signals. (<link><marker>Morozov, 2017c</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0215\"/></link>)</p><p>Seen in this light the emergence of high-end 'smart cities' represents a further incursion of technical expertise into the lifeworlds of people, the ethos of cultures and the character of the settlements where much of humanity lives. Greenfield's conclusions therefore speak directly to this process. He finishes with several recommendations that can be summarised as follows.<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The use of algorithms to guide the distribution of public resources should be regarded as a political act.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Claims of perfect competence in relation to 'smart city' rhetoric should be rejected.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Any approach the whole IT domain should include a healthy dose of skepticism.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Commercial attempts to gather ever more data about people should be resisted (<link><marker>Greenfield, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0110\"/></link>).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.2. Taming the ubiquitous algorithm</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0250\"/>Standing at the core of a vast number of IT processes is the ubiquitous algorithm. Its relative obscurity and foundation in mathematics means, however, that for many people it remains a mystery. But this need not continue. Cathy O'Neil was originally employed as a 'quant' in the heart of the New York financial district prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). She saw first-hand, how the algorithms that exploit 'big data' can be used productively or as instruments of power and exploitation. In her view most people are unaware of how these new capabilities have proliferated. Consequently the reliance of bureaucratic systems on them is seldom appreciated. In the US she notes that 'getting into college, getting a job, being assessed as a worker, getting a credit card or insurance, voting, and even policing are in many cases done algorithmically.' She adds that:<br/>Moreover, the technology introduced into these systematic decisions is largely opaque, even to their creators, and has so far largely escaped meaningful regulation, even when it fails. That makes the question of which of these algorithms are working on our behalf even more important and urgent (<link><marker>O'Neil, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>She uses a 'four-layer hierarchy' in relation to what she calls 'bad algorithms.' At the first level are those with 'unintentional problems that reflect cultural biases'. Next are those that 'go bad through neglect.' Third are those that she regards as 'nasty but legal' and finally 'intentionally nefarious and sometimes outright illegal algorithms.' In relation to the latter she adds that:<br/>There are hundreds of private companies, including dozens in the UK, that offer mass surveillance tools. They are marketed as a way of locating terrorists or criminals, but they can be used to target and root out citizen activists. And because they collect massive amounts of data, predictive algorithms and scoring systems are used to filter out the signal from the noise (<link><marker>O'Neil, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>The scam run by Volkswagon to conceal the results of emissions tests is, in her view, perhaps the most well known example, but the sale of surveillance systems to repressive regimes looms larger as a serious future threat. In her 2016 book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Weapons of Math Destruction</emphasis> she looks into numerous context only to find the same dynamic at work. In one case a school district attempted to identify the weakest teachers and designed a set of tests of 'teacher effectiveness' using algorithms. Many of the criteria, however, such as how well students were learning year to year, could not be measured directly. The use of unverifiable proxies resulted in wildly varying results - but teachers were sacked anyway. From this and other cases O'Neil concluded that many algorithms are poorly designed and proxies used in place of real data invisibly distort the results. Another oft-experienced trap is where hidden feedback loops render data meaningless the more often they are run within a system. What is also significant about this account is that the underlying issues are less about mathematics, statistics or data, than they are about transparency (or its lack) power and control. Currently in the US, for example, the well off can usually afford human representation whereas the poor are left with poorly performing data and a bureaucracy they can neither influence nor communicate with. In summary, used well algorithms can be tools that usefully extract value from big data. Used poorly, they can certainly ramp up the efficiency of operations but at the cost of unreliable or unjust results and increasing inequality.</p><p>O'Neil suggests a number of solutions, none of which are short term or particularly easy to implement without wider social support. 'First and foremost', she suggests, 'we need to start keeping track.' For example, 'each criminal algorithm we discover should be seen as a test case. Do the rule-breakers get into trouble? How much? Are the rules enforced, and what is the penalty?' She continues:<br/>Even once we start building a track record of enforcement, we have ourselves an arms race. We can soon expect a fully-fledged army of algorithms that skirt laws, that are sophisticated and silent, and that seek to get around rules and regulations. They will learn from how others were caught and do it better the next time. In other words, it will get progressively more difficult to catch them cheating. Our tactics have to get better over time too (<link><marker>O'Neil, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>Finally she suggests that:<br/>We need to demand more access and ongoing monitoring, especially once we catch them in illegal acts. For that matter, entire industries, such as algorithms for insurance and hiring, should be subject to these monitors, not just individual culprits. It's time to gird ourselves for a fight. It will eventually be a technological arms race, but it starts, now, as a political fight. We need to demand evidence that algorithms with the potential to harm us be shown to be acting fairly, legally, and consistently. When we find problems, we need to enforce our laws with sufficiently hefty fines that companies don't find it profitable to cheat in the first place. This is the time to start demanding that the machines work for us, and not the other way around (<link><marker>O'Neil, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>O'Neil's program for re-purposing algorithms is certainly ambitious but, given the plethora of unresolved issues in this area, it seems entirely appropriate. In her book she also calls for a 'model builder's pledge' (similar to the Hippocratic Oath taken by medical practitioners) a full-scale regulatory system, algorithmic audits and greater investments in research. In light of this she speaks approvingly of Princeton's Web Transparency and Accountability Project and European approaches (noted below) that are, even now, starting to dictate a new raft of terms and conditions that the Internet giants will have to recognise. Ultimately, she returns to the same ground that others have indicated in arguing that such choices are fundamentally moral, hence also ethical and social.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.3. Defensive measures, key questions</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0080\"/>Many options are available to those who are willing to invest the time and effort required. In mid-2017, for example, Australian reporter Rose Donahue interviewed Helen Nissenbaum in New York about what the latter calls the 'obfustication movement.' This was described as a 'David and Goliath' strategy that relied on the fact that the former had more freedom to act than the latter (<link><marker>Donahue, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0080\"/></link>). Donahue noted that Nissenbaum had developed tools specifically designed to disrupt Google's tracking and ad delivery systems. One called 'TrackMeNot' allows users to browse undisturbed under the cover of randomly generated searches. Another dubbed 'AdNauseum' is a tool that collects data from every site visited by the user and stores them in a vault. This vastly overstates the user's activity and therefore serves Google false information. While such tools may at present appeal only to a minority there are undoubtedly many more to come. A high-tech defensive war against the overreach of Internet oligarchs is increasingly likely. Many of these tools will become easier to use and personal agency will be enhanced as more people avail themselves of them.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0015\"/>In summary, the present Internet has evolved - or 'de-evolved' - into its present condition over an extended period. It will therefore not easily be prised from the grasp of giant corporations. Repurposing the Internet will take time. It will take concerted social and political action as well as extensive technical backup. Charles Arthur credits online rights activist Aral Balkan with the following insight: 'If you see technology as an extension of the self, then what is at stake is the integrity of our selves'. He continues: 'Without that - without individual sovereignty - we're looking at a new slavery' (<link><marker>Arthur, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0015\"/></link>). So key issues include the following.<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>What kind of society do we want to live in?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>What visions of human life, society and culture do we believe in?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>What kinds of futures arise from our collective decisions?</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>It will not escape readers of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Futures</emphasis> that these are exactly the kinds of questions that have driven futures/foresight thinking and practice for several decades. As the wider implications of IT revolution cause more and more people to focus upon them so new players will need to become more involved in the search for solutions. Governments, city authorities and civic administrators at all levels will need to be open to new forms of social engagement. They, in turn will also need greater support from an informed public.25</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Productive innovation</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.1. Social democracy</emphasis></h><p>Many of the decisions and practices of the high-tech innovators and oligarchs have gained support from prevailing assumptions about the market, the consumer, a minimal role for government and so on. Yet despite its broad influence the durability of neoliberalism as a guiding ideology should not be overstated. An in-depth review of neoliberalism by Metcalf refers to a 2016 paper published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that explicitly connects the former with some of its most significant consequences. These include 'pushing deregulation on economies around the world ... forcing open national markets to trade and capital, and for demanding that governments shrink themselves via austerity or privatisation' (<link><marker>Metcalf, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0195\"/></link>). While such insights may appear unremarkable in themselves they represent a startling admission by the IMF whose policies have long supported such practices. The author also suggests that the ideology should not be seen merely a 'standard right wing wish list' but rather 'a way of reordering social reality, and of re-thinking our status as individuals.' Viewed in this light the main premise - that 'competition is the only legitimate organising principle for human activity' - seems unlikely to remain viable over the longer term since it rules out and overwhelms vital human capacities. These include care, compassion, philanthropy and the like which all healthy societies need in order to function at all. The decline of neoliberal values and assumptions would also mean that previously unthinkable options would emerge, as would new strategies to reform the system. A 'new normal' would have its chance to become established.</p><p>In the UK a resurgent Labour Party raises the possibility that just such a development could be occurring through the rise of social democracy. Rundle summarises what he considers to be some of the wider implications. In this distinctively optimistic view local, national and global societies could:<br/>Be run as a tripartite process of state, market and community institutions, with a \"democratically enabling\" state enforcing limits to the private sector, mandating social-economic spaces into which community/open/free/collective activities can expand, and having democratic socialised ownership, whole or part, of key economic sectors.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0265\"/>Such a shift has major implications for all sectors of the economy - which includes IT systems and the Internet. He continues:<br/>That means ultimately that energy, water, resources, finance capital and communications infrastructure should be seen as social in nature, part-owned by the state, and certainly steered by it, through, for example, elected public boards. It means recognising that when corporations such as Google become monopoly default resources, they have de facto socialised themselves and institutional arrangements should reflect that (<link><marker>Rundle, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0265\"/></link>).</p><p>Raw suggestions in this form have a long way to go before they can be rendered into widespread practice. Yet they make a good deal of sense in the current context. Google/Alphabet, for example, may thus far have avoided the rigours of US anti-trust regulations but this may turn out to be a temporary 'victory' as other governments step in to take actions based on alternative assumptions and views (see below). Rundle's piece also demonstrates yet again why so many observers and critics of the IT revolution argue that the central issues are not primarily technical but social and political. Society as a whole needs to take part in multi-faceted conversations of this kind.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.2. New infrastructure</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0180\"/>There's no shortage of ideas and proposals regarding 'what needs to be done' to re-design and re-direct the Internet and, by extension, high-tech innovation in general. Helen Magretts of the Oxford Internet Institute is no exception. In order to deal with aspects of Internet aggression she suggests that:<br/>Any successful attempt to prevent extremist, abusive and hateful behaviour online must be multifaceted, thoughtful and collaborative. It will involve ethical and legal frameworks to guide as well as mandate good behaviour; working with tech companies rather than making enemies of them; smarter policing of activities that are already illegal; and crowdsourcing safety, so that people and social enterprises play a role (<link><marker>Magretts, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0180\"/></link>).</p><p>Cathy O'Neil puts a strong case for the establishment of a new infrastructure to deal with the uses and misuses of algorithms. She seeks to create reliable records of how these tools are used and by whom. She also knows that to do so will not be easy as powerful organisations normally resist being called to account. She writes that:<br/>We need to demand more access and ongoing monitoring, especially once we catch them in illegal acts... We need to demand evidence that algorithms with the potential to harm us be shown to be acting fairly, legally, and consistently. When we find problems, we need to enforce our laws with sufficiently hefty fines that companies don't find it profitable to cheat in the first place. This is the time to start demanding that the machines work for us, and not the other way around (<link><marker>O'Neil, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0250\"/></link>).</p><p>Taplin goes further than most in optimistically proposing what he calls a 'digital renaissance.' This has various features that include:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>a shorter working week and the establishment of a universal basic income (UBI);</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>measures to get the technical and creative communities working together;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>revisions of the 'safe harbour' provisions in the DMCA act;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>the Library of Congress issuing new guidelines as to the 'fair use' of creative and copyrighted material;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>revisions to, and wider application of, anti-trust regulations (to break up monoplies); and,</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>a proliferation of co-operatives, non-profit companies, and what he calls 'zero-marginal-cost distribution systems (<link><marker>Taplin, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0355\"/></link>).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p><anchor id=\"ref0270\"/>In this latter respect Taplin echoes suggestions by Rushkoff that were noted in a previous paper. Rushkoff is interested in exploring a range of social and economic inventions in the context of re-thinking what money is and is for (<link><marker>Rushkoff, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0270\"/></link>). Finally Morozov (whose work has contributed substantially to this enquiry) suggests that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a single data utility</emphasis> would be best placed to make the best use of material from divergent sources. In the light of current experience with commercial entities it would need to be non-commercial and publically owned, much as Rundle has suggested. Given that progressive governments could set up such utilities quite easily the next step would be to ensure that 'whoever wants to build new services on top of that data would need to do so in a competitive, heavily regulated environment while paying a corresponding share of their profits for using it.' He adds that 'such a prospect would scare big technology firms much more than the prospect of a fine' (<link><marker>Morozov, 2017a</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0205\"/></link>).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.3. Effective regulation</emphasis></h><p>When the European Union (EU) handed Facebook a $120\u202fm fine in May 2017 and Google a heavy $2.4bn in June, both for market abuses, many wondered what the next step would be. By mid-2017 the answer came in the form of another acronym - the GDPR (or general data protection regulation). Long time observer of the IT scene, John Naughton, emphasised that GDPR is not a directive but a regulation so it will become law in all EU countries at the same time. Some of the implications are as follows:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The purpose of the new regulation is to strengthen and rationalise data protection for all individuals within the EU. It also covers the export of personal data to outside the bloc. Its aims are to give control back to EU residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying regulation.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The GDPR extends EU data-protection law to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">all</emphasis> foreign companies that process the data of EU residents. So even if a company has no premises or presence within the EU, if it processes EU data it will be bound by the regulation. And the penalties for non-compliance or infringement are eye watering, even by Internet standards: fines up to (EURO)20\u202fm and/or 4% of global turnover.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>More significantly, the GDPR extends the concept of \"personal data\" to bring it into line with the online world... The regulation gives important new rights to citizens over the use of their personal information... Valid consent has to be explicitly obtained for any data collected <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and for the uses to which it will be put</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Citizens will now have the right to request the deletion of personal information related to them (<link><marker>Naughton, 2017a</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0235\"/></link>;).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>This is obviously what pundits call a 'game changer' as it fundamentally changes the rules for how these organisations collect, will be able to use and manage private data. Naughton calls it an 'existential threat' to those currently operating beyond the reach of existing data regulation laws. It will certainly help to resolve the present situation in which people's private lives everywhere are regarded as 'fair game' to entities whose sole interests lie in sales, profit and power. And it will go a long way to resolving some, but by no means all, of the concerns expressed so clearly by <link><marker>Zuboff (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0390\"/></link> and others. At the same time it should be recognised that public service sectors such as education and health will have to adjust their own procedures and this will involve considerable costs.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.4. The technical is political - the return of anti-trust</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0210\"/>As the oligarchs have steadily penetrated ever more areas of human and economic life they've become so powerful that they abjure regulation by elected bodies and are frequently said to be way 'ahead' in terms of their products and services. But this is a mistake. If we accept that the technical is political it is harder to confuse technical mastery with other forms of expertise. As ever, Morozov nails the core of this confusion by reference to underlying social interests. He poses the following question:<br/>How could one possibly expect a bunch of rent-extracting enterprises with business models that are reminiscent of feudalism to resuscitate global capitalism and to establish a new New Deal that would constrain the greed of capitalists, many of whom also happen to be the investors behind these firms? (<link><marker>Morozov, 2017b</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0210\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0330\"/>During mid-to-late 2017 it was clear that, while the Internet giants were not about to collapse, social and political forces on both sides of the Atlantic were beginning to line up in broadly the same direction. Signs were emerging that might be called their 'golden age' could be coming to a close. In September, for example, the Guardian editorialised that 'Amazon's dominance of the eBook market may not have raised prices, but it left the sector anaemic and competition floundering'. Another commentator was quoted as saying of the oligarchs that he did not think 'any credible economist who isn't an Ayn Rand lunatic would accept that these are not monopolies'; also that 'Amazon sells 65% of books online now, Google controls 80% of the search market' (McChesney in <link><marker>Solon &amp; Siddiqui, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0330\"/></link>). More people than ever are becoming aware of the fact that something is very wrong with this picture.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0325\"/>During the same month Ben Smith, a well-regarded Buzzfeed writer, was among the first of many to confirm what he called a 'palpable, perhaps permanent, turn against the tech industry.' He added that 'the new corporate leviathans that used to be seen as bright new avatars of American innovation are increasingly portrayed as sinister new centres of unaccountable power.' In his view this constituted 'a transformation likely to have major consequences for the industry and for American politics' (<link><marker>Smith, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0325\"/></link>). He also reported on how politicians of widely differing views were urging 'big tech' to be considered less as private companies than as 'public utilities.' After years of denying the value or relevance of treating the high-tech giants in the same way that Bell Telephone and Microsoft had been treated in earlier years (i.e. broken up into small units) anti-trust legislation was finally back on the agenda. Similarly Washington senators Elizabeth Warren and Claire McCaskill both became involved in making anti-trust regulations part of the Democratic agenda over the next four years. Overall, the gap between ideas and effective action was perceptibly closing.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. Humanising and democratising the IT revolution</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.1. Public goods and moral universals</emphasis></h><p>If anything has become clear during the present enquiry it is that humanising the IT revolution requires something other than technical innovation. It obviously has many technical implications but the key drivers of a multi-faceted shift toward a different <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">modus operandi</emphasis> are not technical but found within human, social and cultural contexts. As Zuboff noted in relation to big data, 'it is not an autonomous process ... it originates in the social, and it is here that we must find it and know it' (<link><marker>Zuboff, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0390\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0130\"/>The current 'de-evolved' Internet and explosion of radically ambivalent high-tech innovations provide clear evidence of an extended and continuing cultural failure. Despite its many positive aspects it's becoming harder to avoid the fact that the US has become enmeshed in its own downward spiral. Countless words have been written on this topic but one core concern is its singular lack of success in creating viable 'public goods' such as free health care, quality education, protection from random violence and public wellbeing on a broad scale. Umair Haque argues that the lack of such goods separates the US from all other advanced nations. The former spring from 'moral universals' that he suggests are largely absent from the US but which are needed to 'anchor a society in a genuinely shared prosperity.' Such universals don't simply 'spread the wealth' but help to civilise people. They 'let people grow to become sane, humane, intelligent human beings' - all characteristics upon which democracy depends. Any society lacking these characteristics simply runs out of steam. In this view, what happened in the US is that:<br/>They have never seen - and still don't see - the benefits: the civilising process that democracy depends on. Thus, in America today, there are no broad, genuine, or accessible civilising mechanisms left. ... The natural consequence of failing to civilise is breaking down as a democracy - democracy no longer exists in the sense of \"people cooperating by voting to give each other greater prosperity\". They have merely learned to take prosperity away from one another (<link><marker>Haque, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0130\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0115\"/>Such suggestions must be treated as debatable, yet Haque is not alone in advancing this general argument. Noted Australian journalist, Peter Greste is in broad agreement. In his opinion 'since America's founding, its leaders have recognised that the country's real authority - as opposed to power - rests on its moral standing.' Yet the routine outpouring of ignorance by the US president has 'placed the US on the same moral plane as some of the world's most ruthless tyrants.' He finds this 'deeply troubling' because 'without a clear moral framework, the world becomes a snake pit of competing national interests' (<link><marker>Greste, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0115\"/></link>). Such sentiments provide yet another factor that helps to account for the debased version of Internet usage and commerce that became normalised over recent years.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.2. Values, worldviews, research</emphasis></h><p>Taken together the above goes a long way toward explaining why the Internet became compromised. It not only failed to deliver on the idealism of its early proponents but also became a source of exploitation, danger and oppression. The many and varied uses of IT are divided between the genuinely helpful and those that are routinely misused. At least two underlying rationales for moving toward the former can be briefly mentioned here. One springs from value and worldview considerations. An outlook typified by greed, selfishness, exploitation and an underlying disregard for real human and social needs will produce, and has produced, applications adapted to these uses. On the other hand positive values such as generosity, care and respect, especially when coupled with socio-centric or world-centric outlooks, will be directed toward more widely useful and constructive uses. This identifies a core difference between, say, monopoly platforms that treat people like mindless sheep by driving them into the arms of the advertising industry, and socially useful innovations such as local currencies, that respect and build local economic and social wellbeing.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0075\"/>As noted above, a different, but related, rationale can be drawn from evidence-based Earth science. The latter makes it abundantly clear that humanity is under real and unrelenting pressure to re-think the conditions of its tenancy of this small planet. Here values such as caring, foresight and obligations to future generations come to the fore. They simply make better sense in this context. Roger Dennis is not alone in suggesting that leaders in technology need broader and deeper views of the world. In fact he suggests that 'the industry doesn't need more programmers, it urgently needs more women, ethicists and philosophers' (<link><marker>Dennis, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0075\"/></link>). Political decision-making about the uses and abuses of all classes of high technology need to be returned from 'defence' contractors, specialised labs and private corporations to well-staffed and properly equipped locations firmly placed within the governance and related structures of civil societies. This process will certainly include private initiatives that draw both on progressive values and emerging technologies to help break the multi-monopolies of currently over-dominant players (<link><marker>Ahmed, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0005\"/></link>). It follows that effective and helpful innovation does not necessarily mean expanding the size of governments per se, but it will certainly require overturning any residual notion that 'markets rule.' Clearly they don't and can't.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0150\"/>Another way to 'humanise the future' is to ensure that sufficient human and economic resources are directed toward high quality evaluation and research. In late 2017, for example, the Oxford Internet Institute found clear statistical evidence that during the previous US election 'the balance between freedom of speech and election interference has been tipped.' Specifically 'Twitter users got more information, polarising and conspiratorial content than professionally produced news' and 'average levels of misinformation were higher in swing stages than in uncontested states' (<link><marker>Howard &amp; Kollanyi, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0150\"/></link>). Junk news is an ideal medium for the further propagation of junk science. So the researchers came up with a short list of actions to deal with the abuses they uncovered. These include:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Up-dating the Uniform Commercial Code ... forcing companies to adhere to basic anti-spam and truth-in-advertising rules;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Ensuring that paid political content on social media is accompanied by the disclosure of backers;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Social media platforms be required to file political advertising and bot networks with election officials; and,</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Bots in general be clearly identified to users (<link><marker>Howard &amp; Kollanyi, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0150\"/></link>).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p><anchor id=\"ref0085\"/>Not long after this the Economist magazine (not particularly well known for having a progressive outlook) ran a 'leader' story that posed the question Do social media threaten democracy? One reason provided was that 'far from bringing enlightenment, social media have been spreading poison' (<link><marker>Economist, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0085\"/></link>). Clearly disquiet with social media is no longer limited to a few marginal sources. During 2017 disruptions to vital democratic processes - especially during the US election and the 'Brexit' referendum - carried out by Russian and other sources had been acknowledged and documented in detail (<link><marker>Cadwalladr, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0055\"/></link>). Given the complexity of issues involved, high quality research and monitoring of such activities becomes vital. It allows knowledge and policy-formulation to be up-dated, miscreants to be identified and, overall, routine reality checking to occur.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.3. Sharing cities, platform cooperativism</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0295\"/>Nowhere is the potential for new kinds of IT-enabled organisations and practices more timely and useful than in relation to cities and cooperatives. For example, in Darren Sharp's view the notion of Sharing Cities - rather than merely 'smart' ones lacking a social contract with citizens - can serve as 'an antidote to top-down technologically deterministic visions of the future.' His vision is one in which existing infrastructure such as wi-fi and spaces within public buildings are made more widely available. He looks to Seoul and Amsterdam for examples of how a sharing approach is actually working. In summary he suggests that 'Sharing Cities create pathways for participation that recognise the city as a commons and give everyone the opportunity to enjoy access to common goods and create new forms of shared value, knowledge and prosperity' (<link><marker>Sharp, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0295\"/></link>). That this is not an isolated example and should be seen in a much wider context is demonstrated in a fine collection of 137 case studies. This is much more than a 'how-to' reference work as it presents <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a vision</emphasis> for cities that situate people (rather than the market, technology or governance) at the core of what cities are and how they operate (<link><marker>Shareable, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0290\"/></link>).</p><p>In a similar vein Rushkoff explores the potential of democratically focused social and economic innovations. Drawing inspiration from existing examples he highlights possible characteristics of IT-enabled 'steady state' enterprises, 'platform cooperatives' and 'genuinely distributist businesses.' Such features include the need to 'reclaim values' in support of 'women's equality, integrative medicine, worker ownership and local currency' (Rushkoff, 2016, 215-37). Platform cooperatives are among the most promising of new IT-enabled and democratically constituted organisational forms. One of the most thorough treatments of this emergent phenomenon is provided by Trebor Scholz. As with many other observers he is clear about the need for change. For example he writes that:<br/>We cannot have a conversation about labour platforms without first acknowledging that they depend on exploited human lives all along their global supply chains, starting with the hardware without which this entire \"weightless\" economy would sink to the bottom of the ocean. ... (Similarly) this isn't merely a continuation of pre-digital capitalism as we know it, there are notable discontinuities - new levels of exploitation and concentration of wealth for which I penned the term crowd fleecing. Crowd fleecing is a new form of exploitation, put in place by four or five upstarts, to draw on a global pool of millions of workers in real time (Scholz, 2016, 3-4).</p><p>In Scholz' view what he calls 'platform cooperativism' is the coming together of three elements: the existing technical know-how of existing monopoly platforms, a sense of solidarity and reframing concepts like 'innovation' with a view to sharing the rewards. He also provides a typology of platform cooperatives and a useful list of guiding principles:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Ownership.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Decent pay and income security.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Transparency and data portability.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Appreciation and acknowledgement.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Co-determined work.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>A protective legal framework.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Portable worker protections and benefits.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Protection against arbitrary behaviour.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Rejection of excessive workplace surveillance.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The right to log off (Scholz, 2016, 18-21).</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>For Scholz the core of the issue is 'a new story about sharing, aggregation, openness and cooperation.' Equally significant is that his view of the present incumbents may be iconoclastic but it is certainly not punitive. Rather:<br/>The importance of platform cooperativism does not lie in \"killing the death star platforms.\" It does not come from destroying the dark overlords like Uber but it comes from writing over them in people's minds, and then inserting them back into the mainstream (Scholz, 2016, 26).</p><p>This is clearly a human and social process that seeks to recover values that were cast aside in the single-minded pursuit of growth and profit. This, it seems, is the very foundational work that can help to rehumanise and democratise both the Internet and the IT revolution on which it is founded.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7. Conclusion: values and moral development</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0240\"/>This and the previous papers have commented on certain value and worldview limitations that arguably characterise both the ethos of Silicon Valley and some of its leading figures. More recently John Naughton took up the issue of what he calls the 'astonishing naivety of the tech crowd' himself. For him a plausible explanation can be found in the restricted nature of the latter's educational backgrounds - mainly mathematics, engineering and computer science. He notes that these are 'wonderful disciplines' but then goes on to suggest that:<br/>mastering them teaches students very little about society or history - or indeed about human nature. As a consequence, the new masters of our universe are people who are essentially only half-educated. They have had no exposure to the humanities or the social sciences, the academic disciplines that aim to provide some understanding of how society works, of history and of the roles that beliefs, philosophies, laws, norms, religion and customs play in the evolution of human culture (<link><marker>Naughton, 2017b</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0240\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0370\"/>Some may regard these as contentious topics yet there are quite straightforward ways of addressing them in this context. One is to go back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) that was signed off by the United Nations (UN) back in 1948. Here there are a couple of specific articles that speak directly to the themes of this paper, as follows:<br/>Article 12<br/>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">privacy</emphasis>, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.<br/>Article 22<br/>Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realisation, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organisation and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">dignity</emphasis> and the free development of his personality (<link><marker>United Nations, 1948</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0370\"/></link>;).</p><p>These statements clearly established that the nations of the world were firm in their belief that the privacy and dignity of all human beings were to be respected and maintained in perpetuity. After the horror of two disastrous world wars they were deemed to be of particular value and significance. Yet the high-tech sector almost everywhere seems to have lost sight of these vital commitments. Wendell Bell later took up the theme of 'universal human values' in volume 2 of his masterwork <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Foundations of Futures Studies.</emphasis> Here he suggested that:<br/>Human societies and cultures have many features in common. ... Near-universals do not exist by chance. ... They give us insight about which values may have contributed to the survival and flourishing of human societies over the long haul of human evolution (Bell, 1997, 171).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref60025\"/>He continues by discussing four values that he considers of major importance: 'knowledge, evaluation, justice and cooperation.' He also mentions those from a survey carried out by Kidder: 'love, truthfulness, fairness, freedom, unity, tolerance, responsibility and respect for life' (Bell, 1997, 181). Taken out of context such lists mean very little but they do indicate general orientations that have been highly regarded by most cultures over long periods of time. As such they are not to be readily dismissed. The picture becomes clearer still when Bell reviews Kohlberg's stages of moral development, summarised in <link><marker>Fig. 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60025\"/></link> (<link><marker>Kohlberg, Levine, &amp; Hewer, 1983</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0170\"/></link>).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference60025\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref60025\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr5SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr5LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p><anchor id=\"ref0030\"/>Fig. 5 - Social perspectives at six stages of moral development (<link><marker>Bell, 1997</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0030\"/></link>; <link><marker>Kohlberg et al., 1983</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0170\"/></link>).</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p>Bell summarises some of the features of these stages in the following way.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 6</emphasis>: Universal principles of justice, the equality of human rights, and respect for each individual's human dignity are the most important, more important even than the law. Doing right flows from a rational belief in the validity of universal moral principles and having a personal commitment to them.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 5</emphasis>: A rational obligation to be impartial in upholding values and trustworthy in fulfilling voluntarily made contracts, recognising that some general rights such as life and liberty transcend law and majority opinion. Doing right is both fulfilling one's freely agree to obligations and a rational calculation of the greatest good for the greatest number.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 4</emphasis>: A concern with larger social institutions and society as a whole. Doing right is fulfilling one's obligations and being concerned about the welfare of the group.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 3</emphasis>: The need to be a good person in your own and others' eyes. Being mutually loyal... Doing right is living up to the expectations of others.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 2</emphasis>: Serving one's own needs or interests while recognising other people's needs or interests. Doing the right thing still depends on external authority.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage 1</emphasis>: Obedience and the avoidance of punishment. Doing right depends on external authority. (Bell, 1997, p. 218)</p><p><anchor id=\"ref60030\"/>It is for the reader to consider the how well or badly the values and human qualities suggested here may apply to specific individuals and organisations that have colonised the Internet for their own limited purposes. But at the very least Bell and Kohlberg provide us with clear and reliable criteria that can legitimately be used as an evaluative scale. So in terms of moral development thus defined, some organisations and their executive leaders may find themselves hard pressed to provide adequate answers. Which has huge social implications. When the question of re-negotiating social contracts is raised - and it will be repeatedly - then interlocutors can legitimately seek evidence for the fulfilment of these criteria at the highest levels. Possibly the most useful guidance and overall summary is provided by Bell himself when he suggests that 'People live best who live for others as well as for themselves' (Bell, 1997, 275). Finally <link><marker>Fig. 6</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference60030\"/></link> summarises some of the key suggestions made throughout this series back to an Integral perspective.<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference60030\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref60030\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr6SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000093600163287v100sCS0016328717304500mainassetsgr6LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 6 - Humanising and democratising IT.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p>A straightforward four-quadrant analysis illustrates how various right hand quadrant phenomena (including technology, infrastructure and exterior actions) can usefully be related back to various left hand quadrant equivalents (values, worldviews, stages of development etc. as expressed through a variety of cultural norms and conditions). It follows that one way of promoting more humanised and democratic uses of any technology is to simply open to these left-hand quadrant realities and take them fully into account.</p><p>This series has shown how the early Internet was shaped and conditioned by specific human and cultural forces within the U.S. After a fairly benign, government-funded start, a handful of entrepreneurs took over and, with little or no thought for wider consequences, actively fashioned the conditions for their own success. Tax laws were revised. Anti-trust regulations that had earlier been applied to Microsoft and the Bell Telephone Company were set aside. Strategies were undertaken through which private monopoly platforms would grow unhindered into the world-spanning behemoths of today. The rise of neoliberalism then turbo-charged this process. Following Hayek it viewed the government as an impediment to 'progress' and the market as an unquestioned good. These tendencies, along with Rand's nihilistic view of human existence, all helped to bring the present constellation of rootless and invasive entities to its present condition.</p><p>In an alternative world, competent far-sighted governance would have set the conditions for such enterprises and modified them progressively over time. Human rights (including the right to dignity, privacy and freedom from oppression) would have been respected and consciously built into the foundations of the Internet. Corporations would have learned to respect users and therefore to ask before expropriating creative work and private data wholesale for commercial gain. Tax laws that mediated fairly between corporate and social needs would have helped to ensure a steady flow of income for social expenditures. When entities grew too large they would have been broken up or otherwise compelled to adapt. Currently, however, we do not live in that world.</p><p>Yet, as can be seen from some of the many examples outlined above, there are a host of reasons to support informed optimism and hope, the framing of real solutions. Furthermore, it is helpful to remember that some aspects of our situation are by not entirely new. When Martin Luther hammered a copy of his 93 theses onto the Wittenberg church door some five centuries ago, he set himself against the oligarch of the day - the all-powerful Catholic Church. He questioned the legitimacy of that vast institution and, at the same time, began a process that both destroyed its business model and made way for alternatives. Today the underlying dynamic is suggestive but there are also clear differences. Luther's stripped down version of Christianity was a radical change but it still provided people with a sturdy moral framework to guide their thinking and behaviour. Such foundational certainties are more elusive in our own time. On the other hand this very fact arguably provides a rationale for recovering, re-valuing and applying some of the universal human values outlined above. The latter are perhaps among the most viable sources of strength and continuity available during times of transformation and change.</p><p>The legitimacy of the Internet oligarchs is now in doubt from many quarters and for a variety of reasons, so limits are likely to be imposed. Similarly, the business model that daily abuses countless human beings is unlikely to survive without major changes being wrought by newly enfranchised, democratically constituted cooperatives and civil authorities. While government actions may be slow and, at times uncertain, this study has shown that a host of responses, innovations and alternatives is under active development. It is inconceivable that these will not change the nature of digital engagement over time. So it is indeed possible to look ahead with qualified optimism and to anticipate a new and different renaissance. It is one that sets aside technological adventurism and wild, unconstrained innovation, in favour of positive human values and cultural traditions that balance human dignity and rights on the one hand with the enhanced stewardship of natural systems on the other.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Notes</emphasis></h><p>The author would like to thank reviewer 1 for his extensive comments and contributions to the text.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOOTNOTES</emphasis></h><p>The task of grasping some of the interior aspects of social change in the post WW2 era was taken up by interdisciplinary scholars such as Lewis Mumford, Hannah Arendt, Ulrich Beck, Zigmunt Bauman and Jurgen Habermas, among many others.

Here she shows in tragic detail how, in the decades following the 1917 October revolution, Russian society and its people were radically diminished by the withdrawal of official support for, and interest in, questions of values, personal wellbeing and social coherence. Much of the substance of human and social life drained away with tragic consequences.

But academics have been asleep at the wheel, leaving the responsibility for this education to well-paid lobbyists and employees who\u2019ve abandoned the academy.</p><p>That means our main source of information on the downside of bad technology \u2014 often after something\u2019s gone disastrously awry, such as when we learned that fake news dominated our social media feeds before last year\u2019s presidential election, threatening our democracy \u2014 is the media. But this coverage often misses everyday issues and tends to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21728614-machines-read-faces-are-coming-advances-ai-are-used-spot-signs\">far too credulous</url> when it does exists. Much of what should concern us is more nuanced and small scale \u2014 and much less understood \u2014 than what we see in the headlines. Moreover, we shouldn\u2019t have to depend on journalism to do the tedious, serious work of understanding the problems with algorithms any more than we depend on it to pursue the latest questions in sociology or environmental science.</p><p>We need academia to step up to fill in the gaps in our collective understanding about the new role of technology in shaping our lives. We need robust research on hiring algorithms that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-workplace-personality-tests-fair-1412044257\">seem to filter out people</url> with mental health disorders, sentencing algorithms that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing/\">fail twice as often</url> for black defendants as for white defendants, statistically flawed       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-15/don-t-grade-teachers-with-a-bad-algorithm\">public teacher assessments</url> or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/starbucks-workers-scheduling-hours.html\">oppressive scheduling algorithms</url>. And we need research to ensure that the same mistakes aren\u2019t made again and again. It\u2019s absolutely within the abilities of academic research to study such examples and to push against the most obvious statistical, ethical or constitutional failures and dedicate serious intellectual energy to finding solutions. And whereas professional technologists working at private companies are not in a position to critique their own work, academics theoretically enjoy much more freedom of inquiry.</p><p>To be fair, there are real obstacles. Academics largely don\u2019t have access to the mostly private, sensitive personal data that tech companies collect; indeed even when they study data-driven subjects, they work with data and methods that typically predict much more abstract things like disease or economics than human behavior, so they\u2019re na\u00efve about the effects such choices can have. The academics who do get close to the big companies in terms of technique get quickly plucked out of academia to work for them, with much higher salaries to boot. That means professors working in computer science and robotics departments \u2014 or law schools \u2014 often find themselves in situations in which positing any skeptical message about technology could present a professional conflict of interest.</p><p>The many data science institutes around the country, which have created lucrative master\u2019s programs to train data scientists, are more focused on trying to get a piece of the big data pie \u2014 in the form of collaborations and jobs for their graduates \u2014 than they are on asking how the pie should be made. We won\u2019t find any help there. Indeed, while West Coast schools like Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley, are renowned for creating factories that churn out the future engineers and data scientists of Silicon Valley, there are very few coveted permanent, tenure-track jobs in the country devoted to algorithmic accountability.</p><p>A final hurdle: There is essentially no distinct field of academic study that takes seriously the responsibility of understanding and critiquing the role of technology \u2014 and specifically, the algorithms that are responsible for so many decisions \u2014 in our lives. That\u2019s not surprising. Which academic department is going to give up a valuable tenure line to devote to this, given how much academic departments fight over resources already?</p><p>There\u2019s one solution for the short term. We urgently need an academic institute focused on algorithmic accountability.</p><p>First, it should provide a comprehensive ethical training for future engineers and data scientists at the undergraduate and graduate levels, with case studies taken from real-world algorithms that are choosing the winners from the losers. Lecturers from humanities, social sciences and philosophy departments should weigh in.</p><p>Second, this academic institute should offer a series of workshops, conferences and clinics focused on the intersection of different industries with the world of A.I. and algorithms. These should include experts in the content areas, lawyers, policymakers, ethicists, journalists and data scientists, and they should be tasked with poking holes in our current regulatory framework \u2014 and imagine a more relevant one.</p><p>Third, the institute should convene a committee charged with reimagining the standards and ethics of human experimentation in the age of big data, in ways that can be adopted by the tech industry.</p><p>There\u2019s a lot at stake when it comes to the growing role of algorithms in our lives. The good news is that a lot could be explained and clarified by professional and uncompromised thinkers who are protected within the walls of academia with freedom of academic inquiry and expression. If only they would scrutinize the big tech firms rather than stand by waiting to be hired.</p><p>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion\">Facebook</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/NYTOpinion\">Twitter (@NYTopinion)</url>, and sign up for the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday/\">Opinion Today newsletter</url>. <br/></p><p>Cathy O\u2019Neil is a data scientist and author of the book \u201cWeapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy.

Here's some of the things we may be talking about today. Leaked government documents show migrant kids crammed into an Arizona baby jail[1] have been retaliated against by guards for reporting unsanitary and overcrowded living conditions,and one 15-year-old reported being sexually assaulted. These awful conditions aren't a fault of Trump's concentration camps border facilities, they're a feature. </p><p>In a related story, border arrests were down[2] 28 percent last month, likely due to Mexican authorities cracking down on migrants.A federal judge took a steamy dump all over Trump's plans to force a citizenship question[3] on the 2020 Census via executive order when the judge rejected the administration's attempt to swap lawyers.[4] In a statement, US District Judge Jesse Furman took issue with the administration's less than \"satisfactory reasons\" to suddenly switch out DOJ lawyers, noting that the administration was already insisting on fast-tracking the case, adding, \"If anything, that urgency \u2014 and the need for efficient judicial proceedings \u2014 has only grown since that time.\" Furman said the administration could not pass Go or collect its $200, and would need to try again with \"unequivocal assurances\" that the legal team won't just fuck everything up (again). The Washington Post writes that ALLEGED human sex slaver and accused pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's rolodex[5] is full of the super rich and famous, and he liked to flaunt his money as a way of making more money and connections. Yesterday Trump said he \"barely\" knew the guy,[6] a phrase he often uses when one of his friends turns out to be a crook, or a pedophile, or all of the above.Over in Trump World, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has been pushing for Labor Secretary Alex Acosta to be \"You're Fired,\"[7] but not because of his sweet heart deal to accused kid-toucher Jeffrey Epstein. Mulvaney sees Acosta as an obstacle to his (and the administration's) poor-fucking agenda, but Politico gossips that some Senate Republicans like Acosta, since they find him easy to work with. Axios gossips the \"Presidential Social Media Summit\"[8] will include mostly conservative cry babies and \"free speech\" grifters[9] who jerk themselves off with the First Amendment, which doesn't actually apply to private companies. Google, Facebook, and Twitter haven't been invited to participate in the \"family conversation,\" and it's likely to serve as a testing ground for Trump's \"us versus them\" strategy[10] in 2020. Fed chair Jerome Powell is scheduled for a grilling on Capitol Hill[11] this week. Powell is likely to get bitched out by the House Financial Services Committee later this morning, and the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow, but the real question many bean counters want to know is whether or not the Fed will cave to Trump's demands cut interest rates later this month.Meanwhile, Trump is worried that a strong dollar poses a risk to his reelection strategy, so he's been leaning on his Fed nominees to shit all over the buying power of the US dollar.[12] #MAGA. After learning that he was the descendant of slaveholders,[13] Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to liken himself to former President Barack Obama as a convoluted way to oppose slavery reparations.[14] Since 2007 it's been known that Obama is a descendant[15] of former slave owners, and in 2016 Obama told Ta-Nehisi Coates that he'd support robust social welfare programs to alleviate the epidemic of poverty over reparations. But in a scene straight out of The Jerk,[16] Mitch McConnell said nobody know's the troubles he's seen, and that America shouldn't have to give a bloody cent to any black people since slavery happened a long, long time ago in a Kentucky far, far away. Democrats are now hoping to cast McConnell as the villain[17] in the 2020 elections in their attempt to win back the Senate. At the forefront of that effort is retired Marine Lt. Col. Amy McGrath, who yesterday announced her bid to unseat McConnell in the Senate, as well as 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who know they won't be able to do a damn thing unless they swing the Senate. The Republican-controlled Virginia state legislature suddenly adjourned after 90 minutes in order to avoid voting on any gun control bills[18] ahead of a state election. The special legislative session had been called by Virginia's Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam following the May 31 mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building that left 12 people dead. Instead of actually doing its job, the state legislature said it would refer some 30 proposed bills to the Virginia State Crime Commission for a study, THEN consider their votes on Nov. 18. The US wants to build a coalition of the willing to block Iranian threats to commercial shipping[19] in the Persian Gulf, the only problem is they can't find anyone that's actually \"willing.\" Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford says the Uncle Sam's mission will be to leer at all the other boats[20] and shake our fists, and that the mission will be \"scalable\" in the event anyone else wants to tag along. In a related story, the US wants to send the International Atomic Energy Agency into Iran[21] to poke around for nuclear material, but the move is being scoffed at by other countries who think Trump shouldn't have thrown a fucking tantrum and nuked the JCPOA. Axios gossips that Israel's ultra right-wing Minister of Education Rafi Peretz said the intermarriage of US Jews is \"like a second Holocaust\"[22] in a closed closed door meeting on trends in Jewish communities around the world.The UK Parliament is still trying to stop a no-deal Brexit,[23] regardless of what the child-punching potential Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants. Over the last several days Johnson has threatened to suspend Parliament if he's elected Prime Minister, in order to force the UK's immediate withdrawal from the EU, but anti-Brexit politicos are threatening to sue -- a threat that actually carries weight in the UK.  Geeks over at The Verge noticed it's been one year since the repeal of net neutrality.[24] While it's true the internet apocalypse hasn't happened (yet), the FCC's \"light touch\" approach to regulatory responsibility has allowed broadband providers to quietly cut away consumer protections to bleed customers dry (metaphorically, and fiscally). [Podcast[25]]The NRA has been bragging about making money this year, but Bloomberg took a look at their books and found the gun fetishists are using fuzzy math[26] to juice up their numbers. This comes as yet another prominent gun nut issued a public call to \"de-fund\" the NRA amid a spiraling scandal related to the group's shady business practices. Politico has a long, gossipy palace intrigue thing about how Trump survived the Access Hollywood tape.[27] It's a good piece if you're into masochisim and slamming your forehead into hard large, heavy objects. TLDR: Mike Pence (and Jesus) sobbed in a letter that Mother wouldn't let him come out and play, so the campaign blamed everything on Bill Clinton. The End. #SavedYouAClickTrump's TV lawyers are desperate to keep House Democrats from poking around his personal bank vault.[28] The two will appear in a federal appeals court Friday to argue that lawmakers have no right to start nosing around Trump's finances, but House Democrats contend they have a legislative responsibility to see poke around the historically sketchy books. Public and private companies looking to blast off to infinity and beyond are hoping to harvest water from Earth's moon for fuel.[29] Space nerds aren't exactly sure how much water is on the moon, let alone how to harvest it, so it's only natural that big businesses are already rubbing big money boners now that NASA is getting ready for an unmanned test flight[30] of the Orion spacecraft. With the 50 year anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing approaching, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum is partnering up with the Interior Department and some defense contractors to project a 363-foot image of a Saturn V rocket onto the Washington Monument[31] for several days next week.

About a quarter of S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, but analysts say now that Big Tech has reported, the earnings season will be a less-important driver of markets in the coming week. Politics is moving to the foreground as Republicans and Democrats need to come together to approve a stimulus package that will help the millions of out-of-work Americans.  The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday's July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.   The focus will also be squarely on  politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.   The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.   Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.   Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500  finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.    \"August has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.   According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.   In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.    There are also about one-fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks \u2014 Apple , Amazon and Facebook \u2014 surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.  Earnings scorecard  \"We're only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,\" said Stovall. \"I think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We're not seeing that.\"   Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.   Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn't disappoint. But they didn't manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.    Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.  Politics now in play  \"The earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,\" said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research.  \"Obviously, it's volatility season, but it's also an election year. ... We're more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won't hold us up.\"   Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.   \"If he hasn't made headway by then, it's likely he's done.That's about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that's the case,\" Knapp said.   The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.   The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.  The economy  Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.   Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.   \"I think the macro data is going to be fine next week,\" said Knapp. \"I'm not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.\"   NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. \"You look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,\" he said. \"The Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.\"  A trade to watch  Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.   Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.   Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.    Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv's Lipper,  inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD)  in the last week, Lipper said.   During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.   Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.   \"I think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,\" said Knapp. \"The big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You're already seeing it in import prices.\"  Week ahead calendar  Monday    Vehicle sales   Earnings:   AIG,  Clorox, Cirrus Logic, KLA, Rambus, Virgin Galactica, Take-Two Interactive, Mosaic,

Barr has sought to intervene in one of the most high-profile assaults against big tech by the Trump administration  The Justice Department is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google as soon as this month, according to two people familiar with the matter, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled dozens of federal attorneys who signaled the U.S. government was not ready to bring such a landmark case.   The competition inquiry, which , focuses on Google\u2019s sprawling search and advertising empire and the extent to which it harms rivals and consumers. Federal officials have sought to expedite their work in recent weeks, aiming to file a case ideally before the 2020 presidential election, said the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a law-enforcement proceeding.   The fast-track timeline initially appeared to worry some career lawyers at DOJ: This  summer, more than 30 attorneys communicated their thoughts in an informal poll about the probe, and the vast majority said at the time they were not ready to file a case yet against Google, according to a third person familiar with the matter. The DOJ has forged ahead with its work since then under Barr\u2019s direction.   The timeline illustrates the extent to which Barr has sought to mount one of the most high-profile assaults against big tech by the Trump administration. Other details about Barr\u2019s involvement \u2014 and that fractious nature of the Google probe at the DOJ in Washington and throughout the U.S. \u2014 were first reported earlier Thursday by the New York Times.   A spokesman for Barr did not respond to a request for comment. DOJ declined comment. Google declined to comment.   An antitrust lawsuit against Google would mark the second major entanglement between the U.S. government and the tech giant over its corporate footprint. Federal regulators under former president Barack Obama similarly probed the tech giant, but his administration ultimately concluded its investigation in 2013 without pursuing significant, structural changes at Google, including a break up of the company.   Seven years later, U.S. officials have returned to the issue out of a  that Google and its digital peers in Silicon Valley have become too big and powerful, making it more difficult for entrepreneurs to launch rival services and consumers to use the web without putting their digital livelihoods at risk. Amazon, Apple and Facebook have undergone similar scrutiny at either DOJ or its sister agency, the Federal Trade Commission, as well as on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are exploring a rewrite of the country\u2019s competition laws.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. \"SPECIAL REPORT\" is up next with Bret.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks, Jesse. This is a Fox News Alert. I'm Bret Baier in Washington. Breaking tonight, the Justice Department is opening an investigation of major digital tech firms to see if they engage in anti-competitive practices.</p><p>No company names were announced today, but the DOJ is referring to what it calls search social media and some retail services online. Correspondent Kristin Fisher has details on what could be the start of a really big investigation. Kris.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It could be a big investigation and it could really pose a big threat to companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, none of them were specifically mentioned in the press release from the Department of Justice, which dropped less than an hour ago.</p><p>But the release makes it very clear that it's looking into the dominant tech firms of the day to see if they are unlawfully reducing competition, stifling innovation or harming consumers and consumers really seem to be the driving force here, because according to the press release, it reads \"the Department's review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs have expressed about search social media and some retail services online.\"</p><p>Now remember, this probe comes as a growing number of lawmakers and even President Trump have called for stricter regulation. Some lawmakers have even called for the breaking up of some of the big tech companies, including some Democratic 2020 contenders.</p><p>As of right now, most of those companies are not commenting. We've had nothing so far from Amazon or Facebook according to The Associated Press. Apple did get back to the AP and referred them to recent comments from CEO, Tim Cook who told CBS last month that he doesn't think anybody reasonable would call Apple a monopoly.</p><p>But we will have to wait and see, if the Attorney General Bill Barr feels the same way. Bret, this really signals the Attorney General's intent to investigate these big tech companies, full steam ahead.</p><p>BAIER: You know we should point out that this is dual track because DOJ has this on the anti-competitive side. And in this investigation, we don't really know the scope of it as you point out. But on Capitol Hill, it's an entirely different investigation with multiple committees on privacy, on this front, on antitrust. And we don't know the scope of that yet.</p><p>FISHER: Don't know the scope, when it just goes to show you how much Washington is going to be a threat to these big tech companies down the road. This really is by all accounts just the beginning.</p><p>BAIER: Yes. And it'll come up in 2020 I'm sure as well. Kristin, thank you.</p><p>FISHER: Thanks, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: While much of political Washington counts down the hours to one of the biggest days of congressional hearings in years, President Trump is focusing not on former special counsel Robert Mueller, but on what has been his signature issue during the rise to political prominence, immigration. And he's pushing new enforcement of an old law to get illegal immigrants out of the country faster.</p><p>Chief White House Correspondent, John Roberts has details tonight from the North Lawn. Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. With the southern border in crisis, the White House reached all the way back to the Clinton administration to tell illegal migrants as the acting DHS Secretary put it. If you have no legal right to be here, we will remove you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We're building the wall so, they come out, Donald Trump has built almost the wall. What a lie that is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: immigration was on President Trump's mind today talking to teens at a Turning Point USA Summit just as his Department of Homeland Security announced it was expanding its ability to quickly deport people sneaking into the country.</p><p>Under a 1996 law signed by President Clinton, certain people who entered the country illegally can be removed without seeing a judge. The current enforcement has been limited to people in the country less than 14 days and within 100 miles of the border. DHS is expanding the timeframe to two years and will apply the policy across the country.</p><p>In a statement Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan is saying, we are past the breaking point and must take all appropriate action to enforce the law along the U.S. border and within the country's interior.</p><p>Though the authority to expand the criteria is allowed in the original bipartisan bill, Democrats railed against the change. The ACLU told DHS; we'll see you in court.</p><p>For the first time today, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released statistics from its expanded interior enforcement operations begun just after the 4th of July. Out of 2200 people targeted for immediate removal, ICE arrested just 18. Another 17 people were found to be in the country illegally and were arrested.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These are a couple of ICE officers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: This scene in Nashville illustrates the challenge to enforce removals. ICE agents had come to arrest a man, but his neighbors formed a human chain to keep the agents away from the man and his son. The agents eventually left, the man and his son fled to find new accommodations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Homeownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump still hit the members of the so-called squad on his mind today. Specifically, a video of Rashida Tlaib being removed from the President's 2016 speech to the Detroit Economic Club.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: She's vicious. She's like a crazed lunatic. This maniac Tlaib screaming and shouting and I think it's why we're going to have a tremendous victory in 2020.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: At a town hall today, squad member Ilhan Omar indicated the President's criticisms will not silence them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): Right now, even when we're talking about the President. People will say, you know, his remarks are racist, and we'll forget the inherent racism that has always been part of him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump also unveiled a new nickname for the so-called squad today, calling them AOC plus three where Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it's a moniker that he will use to stick the squad to candidates who are emerging as the Democratic front runners as we head toward 2020. Because the President wants AOC plus three to represent the values of the Democratic Party. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: And John, the over under that he actually watches the hearings tomorrow?</p><p>ROBERTS: I'd say it's probably pretty probable. He will be watching at least some of it.</p><p>BAIER: There you go. John Roberts live on the North Lawn. John, thanks. President Trump is suing the House Ways and Means Committee and some New York state officials to prevent the release of his state tax returns. The committee is suing the administration, meantime to obtain his federal tax records.</p><p>New York State has passed a law that could result in the President's state returns being made public. The state's Attorney General says she will vigorously defend that law. You may remember last month, the President said in an interview with ABC that he hoped lawmakers would eventually get all the documents.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They're after my financial statement, the Senate. They'd like to get my financial statement. At some point, I hope they get it.</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: You're going to turn it over.</p><p>TRUMP: No, at some point I might, but at some point, I hope they get it, because it's a fantastic financial statement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The infamous cough there. Trump Attorney Jay Sekulow says the lawsuits are being filed to end what he calls presidential harassment.</p><p>Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller may bring along a plus one to at least one of his congressional hearing's tomorrow. And Republicans are not happy about that. Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge is here with the breaking details. Catherine?</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bret tonight, the highly anticipated hearing is in flux after House Democrats announced a surprise addition. Special Counsel Robert Mueller will have his attorney and longtime associate Aaron Zebley at his side.</p><p>Democrats told Fox, Zebley will be at the witness table with Mueller, which is not standard. Zebley was also a senior attorney on the special counsel case handling some of the most sensitive issues. The House Judiciary Committee led by Democratic Chairman Jerry Nadler host the first round of testimony tomorrow.</p><p>Democrat Adam Schiff, who leads the House Intelligence Committee, host the second round. Schiff told reporters today he received a similar request from Mueller to swear in Zebley as a witness. But Schiff did not want the Mueller hearing converted into a hearing with someone else.</p><p>The senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins laid down a marker, \"a last-minute addition to the witness list would now jeopardize whether tomorrow's hearing complies with the rules of the House. This apparent stunt is unsurprising in light of the Democrats repeated attempts to circumvent, misrepresent and set the rules and procedures governing this committee's business.\"</p><p>Separately, a senior Justice Department official advised Mueller in writing to limit his testimony to the Russia report. In his public statement two months ago after the investigation closed. \"The Department understands that testimony regarding the work of the special counsel's office will be governed by the terms you outlined on May 29th.</p><p>Specifically, that the information you discussed during your testimony appears in and does not go beyond the public version of your March 22, 2019 report to the Attorney General or your May 29th public statement.</p><p>Speaking to Fox News, Attorney General William Barr said, Mueller's team went the left and right boundaries spelled out before the hearing.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: They asked us for guidance in writing to explain or to tell them what our position was. So, we responded in writing. The Department sent the guidance they had requested.</p><p>HERRIDGE: House Democrats want more to bring the report to life and reenergize calls for impeachment. But polls indicate most Americans have not read the 448-page, report Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Catherine, thank you.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>BAIER: Full day coverage starting tomorrow at 8:00. Great Britain soon to be new Prime Minister likes to quip in Latin has a mop of blonde hair and is referring to his constituents today as dude.</p><p>But the most important thing to know about Boris Johnson tonight is that he is promising to do what current Prime Minister Theresa May could not, get Britain out of the European Union.</p><p>Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Greg Palkot reports tonight from London.</p><p>GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The UK just got a new prime minister, almost, the flamboyant Boris Johnson winning a ballot of governing Conservative Party members to be their leader. He'll take over tomorrow after current Prime Minister Theresa May leaves Downing Street and the Queen ask him to form a new government. He sounds up to the task.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, PRIME MINISTER OF UK: Deliver, unite and defeat was not the perfect acronym for an election campaign, since, unfortunately, it spells Dud. But they forgot the final E my friends, E for Energize. And I'd say to all the doubters, dude, we are going to energize the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PALKOT: Johnson will first have to get Britain to exit the European Union or Brexit. He led that winning referendum three years ago. He promises the UK will leave by October 31st with or without a deal, he'll have to win over skeptical EU officials.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEREMY HUNT, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY: He's got optimism, enthusiasm. He puts a smile on people's face, and he has total unshakeable confidence in our amazing country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PALKOT: Still, as London mayor and foreign secretary, some criticized him for making gaffes and not having a grip on policy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JO SWINSON, LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PARTY LEADER: I should think what matters is that we're getting somebody in Downing Street who is not up to the job. He's not the kind of serious politician that we need for serious times.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PALKOT: Johnson does have a good friend in the White House, President Trump is no fan or Prime Minister May. The special relationship was strained. Observers say Johnson's populist and nationalist take on issues makes him a better fit with the President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Really good man is going to be the Prime Minister of the UK now, Boris Johnson. Good man. He is tough and he's smart. They're saying Britain Trump, they call him Britain Trump, and people are saying that's a good thing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PALKOT: In fact, the British are divided on Johnson after years of drift. Some say he might be worth a try.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The country needs a source and hopefully he'll be the person to do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PALKOT: There is talk of Johnson visiting the White House in the near future. Bo Jo, as he's called here still has battles to fight on the UK. Fence mending to do in Europe. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Greg Palkot in London. Greg, thanks. The U.S. Senate has passed new funding for 9/11 first responders who have major health issues, the vote, 97 to 2, the bill now goes to the President's desk. He is expected to sign it. This measure extends this fund through the year 2092.</p><p>Conservatives are warning a new budget and debt deal between the administration and House leaders will continue spending practices that are unsustainable. But a coalition of Democrats and GOP defense hawks are behind this plan. Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel takes a look tonight.</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Despite grumblings from some conservatives, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is all in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (D-KY): I make no apologies for this to your caps deal. I think it's the best we could have done in a time of divided government. The alternatives were much worse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Capitol Hill tried selling Republicans on the budget deal he cut with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The agreement would raise federal spending by $320 billion with $77 billion in offsets to help pay for it.</p><p>But the CBO says that number is optimistic and notes the savings don't kick in for eight years. Some Republicans are highlighting that the agreement includes $20 billion more in defense than non-defense spending over two years. It would also suspend the debt limit for two years through July 2021.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): That's why we've got $22 trillion worth of debt and climbing. And we're just like Thelma and Louise and that car heading toward the cliff.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: It's been called the final nail in the Tea Party movement's coffin. And some of President Trump's closest allies in Congress, Congressman Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan, are No. North Carolina conservative Congressman Mark Walker tweeted out an image from The Dark Knight of the Joker standing next to a burning pile of cash.</p><p>Republican Whip Steve Scalise and his team are expected to start asking GOP members to support the measure, encouraging Yes votes. The Senate Democratic leaders sounded ecstatic that the spending restrictions would be removed with this deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The deal permanently ends the threat of sequester. It's gone and all the suffering that occurred because of the sequester is gone as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Oklahoma Senator James Lankford told Fox today a big part of the problem is looking to trim any defense for entitlement spending is toxic. So, addressing the major drivers of the debt does not happen, which is why the deficit will top $1 trillion this year. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Mike Emanuel live on the Hill. Mike, thanks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will be Shannon Bream's guest tonight 11 PMM Eastern Time, Fox News at night.

First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 5 in New York, as New York Mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Bill de Blasio says it is time to think about other options. After two major power failures from Con Edison and days, de Blasio says the company is shedding no light on what it is going to do to fix the problems going forward.</p><p>Con Ed is a private investor owned utility.

We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee today some form of white supremacy is behind most of the domestic terrorism investigations by his agency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: A majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we've investigated are motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Wray says, the Bureau has made about 100 arrests in domestic terrorism cases through the third quarter of the fiscal year. The Trump administration is proposing tighter automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program. It's a change that could affect about 3.1 million people.</p><p>The Agriculture Department says, the rule would close a loophole enabling people to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines.

Tonight, Biden wants to scrap much of a criminal justice reform law he helped write 25 years ago. Correspondent Peter Doocy on the latest on the Democratic campaign tonight.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: A big part of Joe Biden's pitch is electability. And he's the guy who can beat Trump in 2020. But Biden isn't so sure he could have beaten Trump in 2016. The New York Times asked, and Biden answered, I don't know. Everybody says that. But look, I don't know. You've got to be in the game.

Up next, what Venezuela's disputed president says, the U.S. is really behind a massive power blackout in his troubled country.</p><p>BAIER: Breaking tonight, former Army Secretary, Mark Esper is now the new Defense Secretary of the United States. Esper was sworn in just a few minutes ago in the Oval Office, as you see here.</p><p>Earlier today, he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in a 90 to 8 vote. His entry into the job after seven months without a Defense Chief ends the longest period, the Pentagon has gone without a confirmed leader in its history.

Iran insists it did not lose any of its drones.</p><p>Critics have disputed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro are questioning the government's explanation for a massive blackout last night. Officials are blaming what they call an electromagnetic attack. Correspondent Phil Keating has the latest tonight.</p><p>PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Venezuela's undependable power grid again failed last night, leading to a nationwide blackout. Maduro socialist government is blaming the blackout on a criminal electromagnetic attack but provided no evidence or details as to who or how that alleged attack was carried out.</p><p>This comes just days after U.S. Southern Command says a Venezuelan fighter jet aggressively shadowed a U.S. EP3 aircraft, which it says was in international airspace over the Caribbean.</p><p>The U.S. recognized Venezuelan President Juan Guaido met outside today with the Powerless National Assembly, he heads, the strategic meeting intent on figuring out what to do next. Six months of street protests and clashes with police have failed to remove disputed President Nicolas Maduro. Guaido encouraged more anti-Maduro demonstrations today, urging his people not to give up. Earlier this month, the United NationsCommission on Human Rights accused the regime of sending death squads into the homes of political opponents and killing more than 6,000 people in the past 18 months.</p><p>OTTO REICH, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO VENEZUELA: There are no simple solutions.</p><p>KEATING: Otto Reich, former U.S. ambassador to Venezuela for President Reagan, believes reports that administration officials are considering giving Maduro a golden bridge to exile if he steps down.</p><p>REICH: They are corrupt and they are incompetent and they are brutal.

That's according to officials in Seoul. Russia says its planes were on a routine flight over neutral waters and did not enter South Korean territory.</p><p>Videos have gone viral showing New York City police officers being soaked with water while trying to do their jobs. Those images reinforce how difficult it is to be a police officer, and lately, how difficult it is for cities to find people willing to do that job. One such city is Seattle. Correspondent Dan Springer is there tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Police in New York were doused by onlookers. The lack of respect was even worse across town where an officer was hit by a bucket as he made an arrest. In a tweet today, Vice President Pence called the conduct disgraceful. Anti-cop sentiment appears on the rise and may be thinning the blue line from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine. According to the Department of Justice, there's been an 11 percent drop in cop's per capita since 1997, and 23,000 fewer sworn officers than 2013. The good economy may be one reason, but increasingly officers point to something else -- politics and a lack of support for those who wear the badge.</p><p>MIKE SOLAN, SEATTLE POLICE OFFICERS GUILD: Police officers now are being held to an unreasonable standard, and the scrutiny is immense.</p><p>CARMEN BEST, SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF: We are losing good people, and we know that it's because they feel like they are not supported by public officials.</p><p>SPRINGER: A war of words has broken out in Portland, which has 124 officer vacancies.

And so that's support. That's a big support.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPRINGER: The biggest challenge is hiring new officers. Pay is getting better, but this dangerous job is made tougher by America's opioid crisis and mental illness, not to mention the ever-changing political winds. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Dan Springer in Seattle. Dan, thank you.</p><p>The Mueller hearings are just hours away. We will get predictions from the panel when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL, (D-CA) HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: We can't just assume that most Americans know what happened. We have to, I would say, frame this in a way that they are learning for the first time from someone who had a front row seat to all of these witnesses.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: They also think you're stupid, America, that you can't read the report for yourself.</p><p>JIM HIMES, (D-CT) HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: There's a difference between reading the book and seeing the movie, and part of the objective here is that Bob Mueller bring this thing to life.</p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I don't know how many times we want to see this movie again, but I think the American people have moved on past this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: We are going to see it tomorrow, two big hearings on Capitol Hill. We'll have coverage here on FOX. A bit of a surprise today as we learned that there will be a plus one for Special Counsel Robert Mueller. That is Aaron Zebley. He is the Special Counsel's attorney, also a longtime associate. He was the senior attorney on the case handling some of the sensitive issues, and he will be at the table, we're told, at the House Judiciary Committee, at least, and that has thrown Republicans into a tizzy, and questions about how this is all going to go.</p><p>Let's bring in our panel, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for \"Reuters,\" and former CIA analyst and nationally syndicated radio host Buck Sexton. OK, Ben, thoughts on this late addition and kind of laying out the blueprint here?</p><p>BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I think that to have a late addition like this is consistent with everything that we seem along the process of the way this report has been handled publicly, which is that it has increased, I think, no one's faith in the institutions involved of an approach that is going to be responsible and that's going to stay away from being a real circus.</p><p>The fact is that Mueller is going to come before the Congress and say -- stick to I think most of the report, but I can't see any situation where this is not going to end up being shaded in ways that are trying to damage the president further to get him to try to go further than what the report said. Democrats are going to try to do that over and over again. It's just going to be a circus-like atmosphere, and it's not going to be the kind of thing that the American people deserve.</p><p>BAIER: Jeff, the DOJ wrote this letter saying that he should -- Mueller should stick to the report and kind of what's in the report. There was a back and forth with Jerry Nadler, and then the attorney general weighed in on it. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERROLD NADLER, (D-NY) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I think it's incredibly arrogant of the department to try to instruct him as to what to say. It's part of the ongoing cover-up by the administration to keep information away from the American people.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Bob had said that he intended to stick with the public report and not go beyond that, and in conversations with the department, his staff was reiterating that that was their position. And they asked us for guidance in writing to explain, or to tell them what our position was. So we responded in writing. The department sent the guidance they had requested.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So Mueller actually requested it?</p><p>BARR: Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: So the cover by the administration was actually requested by Mueller. But either way, this looks like it's kind of going to stick to the guidelines.</p><p>JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, REUTERS: The truth is Mr. Mueller said early on before he even agreed to do any testimony that if he were to speak to Congress, he would stick within the confines of his report. And he said that the report contained his essential testimony. It contained the statement that he and his investigators had to make and the evidence that they had to show from the two-year investigation. So there's some back-and-forth about that right now, but it's completely in line with what he has said before if he stays pretty closely to that report.</p><p>BAIER: Democrats just want to soundbites, right? They want the report, and yes, no, is this true, is this not, down the line?</p><p>BUCK SEXTON, FORMER CIA ANALYST: The likelihood of a major revelation here is I think really low. That would be the consensus going into this. But I think as much of what is not said is going to what's focused on here. I think that there will be moments where questions are asked and Mueller stays within the boundaries of the report and doesn't give an answer. People try to make that into a shouldn't he give us more information of this. And there will be arguments as to what the boundaries of the reports are.</p><p>This is all just a way of saying, yes, people are looking for soundbites for their specific narratives here. I think it will be easy for him to deflect on what Republicans really want to know, which is likely to come out in the inspector general report in September. Democrats really just want the reiteration of all of this to the point that was made by the congressman before, one of the congressmen before. They just want this brought to life once again. But I think they may find that this doesn't have quite the impact that they were hoping.</p><p>Also, by the way, the last time around when Mueller appeared on T.V., it was not a great performance. A lot of people started to think how involved was he really at the very top level of the biggest decisions day-to-day, and does he really act as the messenger for the Democrats here that they'd like them to be? I think the answer is no.</p><p>BAIER: There's some serious stuff obviously in these 400-plus pages, and a lot of it deals with what Russia did, what they tried to do, and the reaction to it. Republicans are hoping it backfires. Here's Rush Limbaugh today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: This is a recipe for one of the biggest backfires. Mueller can't go outside the report. He has testified to it. He has put his name on it. It is what it is. It can't be changed, and it's explicit.</p><p>Charging decisions are made by the attorney general, not the special prosecutor. It was Comey's firing that got everybody all hot and bothered on obstruction, and that's what Mueller began investing. The point is, Mueller knew there was no collusion on May 17th.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: And that's one of the questions Republicans will ask, when did you know?</p><p>DOMENECH: I think this is a situation where Mueller could have approached this in a number of different ways. He could have said, look, my report speaks for itself. You've all read it, you've all had the ability to go and check out the background information about this. I'm just going to let it stand.</p><p>He also could have come to the Congress with no preconditions and said, look, I will take any question, I will approach this in a way that will allow every little radical to be going down. Instead we have this situation where nobody's going to be happy with the result. Democrats will wish that he was stronger against the president in all likelihood. Republicans will wish he would've been more open about various potential FISA abuse and other aspects of this investigation that they would like to hear him talk about, and everybody's going to walk away mad at each other.</p><p>BAIER: OK, thanks for that. We will have coverage tomorrow either way.</p><p>I want to turn to this story that we led the show with, and that is the DOJ putting out this letter saying the department's review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online. An antitrust investigation that seems, Jeff, pretty wide in scope. We don't really have the confines of where this is going.</p><p>MASON: Absolutely, very wide, and it didn't specifically name any companies, but the companies that one can assume are involved are alphabets Google, potentially Apple, Facebook, the companies that Americans, people around the world use and rely on for social media, for communicating with each other. They are massive, massive technology companies in this country.</p><p>BAIER: This tracks with congressional efforts to look into these companies. I was anchoring \"FOX News Sunday\" for Chris last month, and I asked one of the Democrats in charge of one of these committees about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE, (D-RI): One of the things I think we are very concerned about is the impact on consumers. When you say they're free, the true is the data that is collected, and their attention is then used to generate revenue. So it's not really free. There have been significant reductions in privacy. There has been substantial evidence of misuse of data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Point being, Buck, that this is the black hat now for Washington, Republicans and Democrats.</p><p>SEXTON: This is also politics driving the way people are going to see the economics of this or the specific definitions about monopoly and antitrust. The major companies that are at issue here had the opportunity to operate more as utilities. They did get their hand stuck in the door here doing stuff that's obviously political. They initially said this isn't really happening. I think now that case is too hard for them to make, and so that's pushing a lot of people to say, well, communications are regulated across the board. I work in radio, there's all kinds of regulations there. They look at murders, they look at what you can say. Why should these companies, especially Google, Facebook, the major ones we're talking about, be able to operate in this space where they are able to get away with a lot of stuff that other companies wouldn't. And I think that's where you're going to see the regulation come in. And I do think that conservatives feel like this is an issue of what's right now. And this is finally -- accountability is needed.</p><p>BAIER: Quickly, this seems like the beginning of the beginning.</p><p>DOMENECH: Yes, it does. And there is a wait right here between the pro- business attitudes that a lot of conservatives have and a lot of their skepticism about this comprehensive digital wokeness that we see driving Silicon Valley's activity in recent months.</p><p>BAIER: We'll follow it. Next up, fast tracking immigration enforcement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEW ALBENCE, ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: Of the 899 that we arrested because May 13th and July 11th, 605 were convicted criminals and 93 had pending criminal charges. What we're looking with these charges are a whole host of individuals crimes ranging from domestic violence to all other sorts of violent offenses.</p><p>KEN CUCCINELLI, USCIS ACTING DIRECTOR: This regulation really just takes us back to the original statute, will help them do their jobs more smoothly, more easily, and safer for the officers as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Expediting of getting illegal immigrants out of the country, the acting DHS secretary saying if you have no legal right to be here we will remove you. We're back with the panel. Buck, what about this move and what it means?</p><p>SEXTON: The president is right that they need to up the deportations, and they also need to start exacting a political price abroad for countries like Mexico, like Guatemala, northern triangle countries that are not doing enough to help with this issue.</p><p>BAIER: You just got back from there.</p><p>SEXTON: Just traveling with the Secretary Pompeo to Mexico City and El Salvador. El Salvador sounds like there are very on board to try to stop the migrant flow. They take responsibility for it as a problem that they are creating, at least within their own borders. Mexico is obviously taking a slightly different approach. They've sent some troops, but they are not doing the third safe country agreement.</p><p>The problem with the Trump administration right now is they keep saying we're going to have these ICE raids and these deportations, and they don't materialize. And people are starting to wonder is that from lack of will or capability, or what is going on here. If you're going to say this is going to happen, and you are negotiating with people on the premise that they better act or else, you need to actually do the things you're going to say, and this administration needs to step up and get those deportations going.</p><p>BAIER: Gallup, the most important problem in the U.S., July 2019, 27 percent say it's immigration is the most important problem. That surpasses any other problem last month. And if you look at the years, basically immigration is taking over as the issue.</p><p>MASON: Yes. And that's something that the president is clearly very aware of because he's talking so much about it. He did in 2016, he will continue to going into 2020. But there might be some vulnerability there if some people from his base or others who are concerned that he's not actually fulfilling the promises that he's made. The big sign at all of his rallies has to do with promises made, promises kept. But he's showing some sensitivity to the fact that there's some criticism that maybe he hasn't been able to make the wall happen in the way that he promised in 2016. Certainly, Mexico is not paying for it. And some of these deportations are not leading to the numbers that he suggested would come.</p><p>BAIER: \"The Washington Examiner\" had a headline, \"Trump is not built a single mile of new border fence after 30 months in office.\" And the president tweeted out, \"When an old wall at the southern border that's crumbling and falling over built in an important section to keep out problems is replaced with brand-new, 30-foot high steel concrete wall, the media says no new wall has been built. Fake news! Building lots of wall!\" Trying to say he's replacing lots of wall with new wall.</p><p>DOMENECH: The problem that we're facing here is much bigger than just a question of a wall. You mentioned Guatemala. Guatemala is a country of about 17 million people. In the last nine months the Border Patrol has acquired and had to process more than 235,000 Guatemalans. That's 1.4 percent of the country all showing up at our southern border. This is a problem that's going to require a lot more than just wall building. It's going to require policies on the part of these Central American countries that are fundamentally different from the ones they are currently advocating for that are pushing people into the arms of human traffickers.</p><p>BAIER: And yet as we get ready for another round of Democratic debates, it seems like there's not a unified message on immigration from the Democrats. In fact, the hand raising that illegal immigrants should get health care, essentially Medicare.</p><p>SEXTON: It's pretty close to open borders, Bret. Every time the administration takes any enforcement measure or even says they're going to take enforcement measures, you can count on all the Democrats on stage, all the Democrats across the party to oppose those enforcement measures. So it's really a de facto open border status. Certainly, if you show up with a child at the southern border you are effectively going to get into the country.</p><p>It has been disheartening to watch the Democrats able to focus on treatment of people at the border specifically as the only issue here, as though we weren't in the midst of hundreds of thousands of people, as Ben points out, getting into this country who plan to stay here illegally, and by the way, are breaking the law in the process coming into the country in the first place.</p><p>BAIER: We will see how it goes down in Detroit at those debates. Panel, thank you.</p><p>A Marine veterans long journey leads to an emotional reunion. We'll bring you that next.</p><p>BAIER: Breaking tonight, you are looking live at the Rayburn House Office Building. These are environmental protesters who have super glued themselves to the door to prevent lawmakers from getting to the capital for votes. You see there's two guys here. Apparently, there's a couple other guys at other doorways. Police are trying to move them out. They've super-glued themselves there. Not sure what chemicals are going to be used to get them unstuck. Maybe not environmentally friendly, but they are doing it, live. We'd thought we'd bring that to you. You can't make this up in Washington.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019072301cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-77J1-DXH2-62WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7551\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The department began work on the matter after brokering an agreement with the government's other antitrust agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to take the lead on antitrust oversight of Google, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.</p><p>The probe could threaten Google with a harsh examination of its sprawling digital empire, which includes its dominant position in search and advertising, its Android mobile operating system and newer gambits such as self-driving cars and drones. Its expansive, data-hungry footprint increasingly has drawn the attention of Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, who say that Google - and some of its peers in Silicon Valley - have become too large and should potentially be broken up.</p><p>The DOJ declined to comment, citing its policy against confirming or denying investigations. The FTC did not respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Some Democrats seeking the presidency in 2020, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have explicitly threatened more oversight of the tech industry if they win the White House.</p><p>Google and other big tech companies \"have too much power and they're using that power to hurt small businesses, stifle innovation, and tilt the playing field against everyone else,\" Warren said in a statement late Friday. \"It's time to fight back.\"</p><p>The Trump administration has also studied Silicon Valley: The Justice Department convened state attorneys general last year to explore the competition concerns posed by Google and other big tech companies. Some of those state attorneys general expressed their own interest in banding together and opening an antitrust investigation of Google at the time.</p><p>In Google's previous tangle with antitrust regulators, FTC officials sought to determine whether the company's search algorithms - and its practice of devoting better screen real estate to its services over those of rivals - threatened competitors. The FTC also investigated Google's advertising practices, as well as the means by which the company licensed to its rivals some of the critical patents involving mobile phones.</p><p>But the FTC opted in 2013 against forcing Google to alter broad aspects of its business, including the way it displays search results. The agency also decided not to pursue a breakup of Google. The decision by the agency, at the time under President Barack Obama, drew the ire of critics who felt the agency should have challenged Google in a way similar to when the government sued Microsoft in the 1990s in one of the last major U.S. antitrust cases. The government at the time alleged that Microsoft broke federal antitrust laws to protect its dominant operating system, Windows, and crush competitors.</p><p>In contrast, Google has faced greater antitrust scrutiny abroad. The European Union has been a leading force in actions against the tech giant, and regulators there have imposed roughly $9 billion in fines against the company in the past three years. Those rulings include findings of violations of competition rules in the way Google presents search results. E.U. rulings also faulted the company for how it licenses its Android smartphone operating system to device makers. E.U. officials also have threatened additional investigations and potential penalties, spurred on by allegations from some of Google's competitors, such as the reviews site Yelp.</p><p>At the Justice Department, a full-fledged antitrust probe of Google could present another major test for an agency that has most recently been scrutinizing the tech and telecom industries. Last year, the department unsuccessfully challenged AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner, and in recent weeks, antitrust lawyers there have raised concerns about the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile.</p><p>Makan Delrahim, who currently leads Justice's antitrust division, is on his second tour of duty at the agency. Delrahim previously represented corporate clients including Google during its purchase of the ad giant DoubleClick in 2007.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-a1cf59d00ef34e6785dc8c389778c7de</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7K-MC21-DXKP-J2GX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><timeReceived>1:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 1, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Federal enforcement agencies rarely announce, or even confirm, ongoing investigations into people or companies. The move was likely a response to growing political pressure, antitrust experts said. Ironically, it may be good news for the tech giants. </p><p>Click here for more BI Prime stories[2]. The US Department of Justice's surprise press release[3] Tuesday of its Big Tech investigation was designed to send a signal to a lot of groups \u2014 but tech companies were not really one of them.  The announcement was an unusually public performance by a federal regulator which typically prizes confidentiality in such matters. That's because it was basically a notice, intended particularly to a key figure in Congress, that the Justice Department will now be spearheading the antitrust investigations into the big tech companies, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington D.C. with decades of experience working for and with competition regulators officials there. For tech companies, the DOJs' announcement was if anything, a subtle indication that the government may not come down as hard on them as it might seem, he said. \"This is good news for the companies,\" Balto said. That may seem a bit ironic, given the substance of the announcement. In its statement[4], the Justice Department said it would review the market power of the \"leading online platforms\" to see if they have thwarted competition or harmed consumers. The agency vowed to \"seek redress\" if it found violations, essentially threatening to sue the companies. Read this: The Department of Justice just launched a broad probe into whether big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and others illegally harm competition[5] The announcement came as something of a surprise. Numerous reports have indicated that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission were starting to look into the competitive practices of the big tech companies. But the agencies had declined to comment on the record for those reports. In fact, federal enforcement agencies rarely acknowledge ongoing investigations into particular people or companies.The agency is likely responding to political pressureUnusual as it was, the Justice Department's move didn't come out of nowhere. Political figures on the left and right, including senators Elizabeth Warren[6] and Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump, have been calling for increased scrutiny of the market power of the big tech companies and even, in many cases, for breaking them up. \"There is enormous political pressure on the agencies in Washington to be seen as doing something about big tech,\" said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school who focuses on antitrust issues. He continued: \"This is their way of responding to the political pressure.\" But Balto thinks there something more going on. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported[7] that the FTC and the Justice Department had divvied up oversight over the tech giants. Under the agreement, the FTC was to get authority over Facebook[8] and Amazon[9], while the Department of Justice would oversee Apple[10] and Google parent Alphabet.[11] The problem with that arrangement was that Mike Lee, who serves as chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights, objected to it, Balto noted. In an opinion piece published by the Washington Examiner[12] last month, Lee lambasted the idea that the agencies would split oversight duties over the big tech companies. The two agencies risked duplicating efforts and causing a divergence in enforcement, he said.\"These investigations will clearly cover much of the same ground,\" Lee said in his op-ed. \"Splitting antitrust investigations of these firms between two agencies,\" he continued, \"is just analytically inefficient.\"The Justice Department is saying it's in chargeLee's subcommittee was scheduled to hold a hearing on Tuesday with top antitrust regulators in the Trump administration at which he was expected to question them over the decision[13] to split up oversight of the tech companies. That hearing ended up being postponed[14], but, in Balto's view, the Justice Department's announcement was its way of responding to Lee's concerns by staking out its turf. \"This is really the (Justice Department) saying, 'thank you, it's my football, and I plan to play with it,'\" he said. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Justice Department's review would not pre-empt the investigations already underway by the FTC into the companies under its purview. Balto says that while the Justice Department may leave some issues to the FTC, Tuesday's announcement indicates that the DOJ is laying claim to all inquiries involving online platform and marketplace issues \u2014 the core of the antitrust charges made against the big tech companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have raised concerns about how those companies use their control over their platforms and marketplaces to give their own products and services a leg up over rivals. \"These issues are incredibly complex, time consuming, and really difficult, and to have two agencies looking at the same conduct really didn't make sense,\" Balto said. Lee's office did not respond to calls or an email seeking comment. Likewise, the Justice Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.The move could be good news for the tech giantsThe news that the Justice Department was opening up its review was seen as a negative sign on Wall Street Tuesday. The big four companies' stock prices all fell following the announcement. But having the Justice Department take point on antitrust review is actually a good thing for the tech companies, Balto said. The Department of Justice hasn't filed a major suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act since the Microsoft case two decades ago. And the agency actually has fewer legal options when it comes to policing competition than does the FTC, he said. \"I don't think anybody's going to lose any more sleep that this is all with the Justice Department,\" Balto said. \"If anything, they'll feel more comfortable in their legal position.\"For his part, Crane is dubious that anything much will come of the investigations in the near future, regardless of which agency is leading the charge. When it comes to antitrust enforcement, the FTC's track record is not much better than the Department of Justice in recent decades, despite theoretically having enhanced enforcement powers, he said. The courts have made it difficult for regulators to win antitrust cases, and even when such cases are successful, they tend to take many years to play out. Because of that, there's little chance the big tech companies will be broken up anytime soon, despite the political pressure on them, he said. \"The kind of blockbuster, 'let's break them up' case that is being trumpeted politically, I just don't see that being in the offing,\" Crane said.

That might change soon. This week, Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broader Oversight and Regulations on Data (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/414097245/Data-Value-Transparency-SIL19753\">Dashboard</url>) Act, which would require tech platforms with more than 100 million users to show consumers the value of their own data. Over the last few years, tech companies have been plagued by allegations of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2019/05/mark-zuckerberg-2020-election-ads-facebook/\">election meddling</url>, anti-conservative bias and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2019/05/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-elizabeth-warren-big-tech-breakup/\">monopolistic behavior</url>-a consistent target of congressional scrutiny. But unlike many of the current regulatory proposals, such as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2019/03/28/elizabeth-warrens-plan-to-bust-up-big-tech-offers-bad-solutions-to-real-problems/\">antitrust</url>, the Dashboard Act would actually help tech build a more civil internet culture while still protecting competition and innovation.</p><p>Large tech companies profit off their ability to use data to curate online experiences, target ads and develop cutting-edge technologies. Big Tech platforms like <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2019/06/sheryl-sandberg-cannes-lions-facebook/\">Facebook</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2019/06/google-lobbying-firms-antitrust-probe/\">Google</url> are vital access points for much of the internet, giving them control over mountains of data and enabling them to be gatekeepers over a crucial resource for innovation. But the people giving them this goldmine, their users, lack a clear understanding of how their data is being used-allowing technology companies to leverage their data in ways that users may not like if they had more of a voice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2018/09/google-20-birthday-major-milestones/\">A Complete Timeline of Google's Path to World Domination</url></emphasis></p><p>The Dashboard Act simply asks that these companies report the aggregate value of user data to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and inform users of exactly how their data is being used. This will help raise awareness about the value of personal data and push us toward more changes, such as making the value of <url normalizedValue=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01805\">each individual user's contribution</url> fully transparent.</p><p>Transparency is crucial in fixing America's digital landscape and boosting innovation. The reign that tech companies currently have over data allows them to crush competitors like smaller start-ups and university labs in the innovation space-particularly in data-intensive fields such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/academia-corporate-research-ai-9d525070-303d-47fd-b822-0fbffcac6740.html\">artificial intelligence</url>. Making users aware of the value of their data would motivate action to return control over data back to its creators, challenging these dynamics.</p><p>In fact, \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2018/09/a-blueprint-for-a-better-digital-society\">data dignity</url>\" advocates have long argued that this shift would fundamentally change society for the better. Users who are aware of the value of their data would be empowered to bargain with the tech platforms that profit off what they produce-allowing a functioning data market to arise. Eventually, users could feasibly license their own data directly to third parties. This would rightfully strip Big Tech of its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2019/05/apple-app-store-antitrust-case-supreme-court-ruling/\">monopolistic gatekeeper status</url>, introducing more competition in data access and allowing innovation everywhere to flourish.</p><p>Interestingly enough, this would also make the internet a much nicer place to be. A great deal of the most <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2019/05/alex-jones-pepe-the-frog-battle-co-opting-symbols/\">toxic online content</url> is hosted on \"free\" sites that rely on advertising to make a profit. These sites encourage passive consumption with algorithms that want the most user attention by showing them content without requiring their engagement. Research       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/07/492871024/facebook-and-mortality-why-your-incessant-joy-gives-me-the-blues\">shows</url> this kind of apathetic internet use translates into worsening mental health. But active consumption, where users seek out the content they consume, encourages healthy online interactions. We see this already on pay-to-use sites, which are rarely the source of the same kind of scandal as free platforms. Knowing the value of data will help us move away from the toxic, \"free\" business models of today.</p><p>For its part, the Dashboard Act could work well. But it's true that, in many ways, it's merely a plea for Congress to help build a better digital society. It's also true that no one should be against the legislation, because it actually demands very little from tech companies. And encouraging a more personal attachment to the value of our online behavior is nothing but a positive. We're going to live in a digital future, so it's important that we shape it to be the kind of future we want.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Khurana is executive director of the Institute for Advancing Prosperity and a Young Voices contributor.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYOBSR-Sat29Jun2019133009+0000TheKeytoDefeatingBigTechTellUsersHowMuchTheirDataIsWorth</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYOBSR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFN-DVK1-JBRW-X2XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241959</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"720\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Observer, L.P.

Will it help or hurt her in 2020?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the early 1980s, the University of Texas law school boasted a good-sized faculty of some 60 professors, only a handful of whom were women. At a time when the legal teaching field was egregiously male-dominated, Texas was no exception; yearbooks from the era show an array of grave-looking older male faculty members in sober suits and horn-rimmed eyeglasses; a sprinkling of flashier young guys with mustaches and long hair; and the occasional female hairbob few and far between. \"You could start a law school with all the women Texas turned down, and it would be so stellar, you couldn't believe it,\" recalls Patricia Cain, who in 1974 had become the first tenure-track woman hired.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the years after Cain broke the hiring barrier, she watched intently as a half-dozen or so women came on. She pushed for more, but the boys' club was alive and well. Then, in 1981, the school agreed to try out a dynamic young woman named Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>On the face of it, Warren and Cain had surprisingly little in common. Cain was a classic boundary-breaker of the era: a liberal, a lesbian and an unabashed feminist. Even now, nearly 50 years later, she still has her copy of the inaugural issue of Ms. Magazine. Warren was a product of the tradition-minded Midwest, a mother of two and the kind of mainstream woman-in-a-man's-world who didn't make feminism a \"thing,\" as Cain puts it. Perhaps because of this, when Warren first came to the University of Texas as a visiting professor-the tryout role for potential hires-their paths didn't much cross. A movement was coalescing called \"feminist legal theory,\" which held that the law, rather than being an instrument of justice, historically was a weapon used to consign women to subordinate status, and Cain gravitated toward another visiting professor who was advancing that theory. Of Warren, she recalls: \"She just wasn't in a position to kind of coalesce with the feminist side of the aisle,\" though, \"I think she was evolving.\" </p><p>Cain and Warren did, eventually, forge a connection. In 1983, Warren came to Texas as a full-time faculty member, and they bonded over logistics-and love. Cain was in a relationship with a law professor at the University of California, Davis, while Warren was married to Bruce Mann, a legal historian teaching at Washington University in St. Louis. \"I had the same kind of commuting relationship she had with Bruce. We kind of shared that misery together,\" Cain says. She was impressed by how supportive Mann was of Warren's career. She also admired Warren for volunteering to teach bankruptcy law, a complex topic that was-and remains-a very male domain. \"I thought that was very brave of her,\" Cain says.</p><p>During these conversations, moreover, there were signs that Warren was paying closer attention than it might appear to gender inequities in their field. \"She had thought about it-how we were being treated by this institution,\" Cain remembers. Warren's view was that their male peers, struggling to learn how to deal with women as colleagues and equals, coped by assigning them familiar female roles. Cain recalls Warren venturing that one of the other female professors \"more fit into the mother image-they sort of knew how to deal with her, because they all had mothers.\" She felt the men found Cain harder to peg. And Warren? \"She described herself,\" Cain says, \"as probably the kid sister.\"</p><p>It could have been an offhand remark, but as the 2020 race unfolds, with Warren as the leading female candidate, the question of just how a woman should pursue an office that has only been occupied by a man has swirled around her. It is a tough truth that full-throated feminism could help Warren in the Democratic primary but hurt her in the general election. And although she might strike voters as similar to Hillary Clinton-a fellow lawyer who came of age in the same era, policy-driven and hyperprepared-Warren's approach to feminism, and to what it means to run as a woman in 2019, is harder to define. But her history in Texas and afterward offers clues.</p><p>Warren, who was born in 1949, was a kid sister growing up in post-war Oklahoma. \"She has three older brothers, which is significant,\" says her friend Elizabeth Vale, who worked with Warren at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency Warren launched after the financial crisis. That Warren, during her formative years, was obliged to play in what we might call male spaces, is-Vale speculates-part of the key to who she became. Rather than build a feminist critique of the power structure or set about dismantling the patriarchy by taking on sex discrimination cases, Warren chose to enter male fields and compete toe-to-toe.</p><p>Another Texas colleague, Jay Westbrook, uses the phrase \"tomboy\" to describe her: the kind of scrappy, two-fisted girl who enjoys competing with the boys, loath to complain about getting scratched and scraped in the fray. By adopting this approach, Warren has lived a compelling story of confronting and surmounting just about every impediment the past seven decades have presented to high-achieving women-but it's a story that could seem to have unfolded in a world parallel to, and apart from, the organized feminist movement. For much of her career, she has not been a vocal champion of women's rights, her rhetoric more muted than candidates like New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand or Hillary Clinton. \"I don't think she has a specific gender lens,\" Vale says. </p><p>More recently, though, a new Warren has emerged. In a statement to Politico Magazine, Warren said that while the financial and economic topics she focuses on aren't always talked about as \"women's issues,\" when she ran for the Senate in 2012, she detected \"a renewed focus on reproductive rights and violence against women\" and \"felt a new sense of energy among women I met on the campaign trail.\" And as one of only two viable women candidates remaining in the Democratic presidential primary field, she invokes gender-its advantages and outrages-with increasing fierceness. When the Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, accused her earlier this fall of having an \"angry, unyielding viewpoint,\" Warren fired off a fundraising email saying, \"Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.\" She has a ritual slogan for girls who come to her events: \"Running for president-that's what girls do,\" she says, coaxing them to \"pinky swear\" that they'll take this idea to heart. Her campaign website offers a line of feminist merchandise, including \"That's What Girls Do\" T-shirts and a \"Pinky Promise\" baby onesie. She has vowed to wear a Planned Parenthood scarf to her inauguration and, alluding to fighting climate change, said, \"I will do everything-oh, I love saying this-a president can do all by herself.\"</p><p>Warren also has started appealing to groups that identify around gender, with three key speeches evoking the advocacy of 19th- and 20th-century working-class women-seamstresses, garment workers and laundresses. And she has begun talking more about hardships she encountered in her own career, such as the harassment she suffered as a young professor at the University of Houston law school, where a more senior male colleague relentlessly made dirty jokes and commented on her looks, then invited her to his office where, she told NBC, he \"slammed the door and lunged for me.\"</p><p>That she is amping up the feminist volume might be because she feels freer, even obliged, to do so in a post-#MeToo era. Part of it, too, is surely because she must distinguish herself from her male rivals in a competitive primary. But maybe Warren's enhanced outspokenness is not quite the pivot it seems. Without saying so, Warren long has practiced a kind of stealth feminism, gravitating toward the epicenter of male power in order to attack it from within. As both a law professor and a politician, her key targets-banks, billionaires and Big Tech-represent the chief remaining bastions of male privilege and wealth, while fields like law and medicine have been thoroughly feminized. Warren's signature issue-a \"wealth tax\"-would fall harder on men, insofar as there are more male billionaires than female ones. If \"angry\" is the code word lobbed at powerful women, Warren deploys \"billionaire\" as code for powerful men.</p><p>When one of those billionaires, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, entered the presidential race just as California Senator Kamala Harris was dropping out, Warren's campaign fired off another email pointing out that two women senators \"have been forced out of this race, while billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg have been allowed to buy their way in.\" She reiterated the point in a thread of tweets on December 6, vowing to carry on Gillibrand's work on paid leave and Harris' on reproductive rights.</p><p>As Warren's surge in the polls fades, she faces an existential moment. She remains one of the top four Democratic candidates, and the only woman among them; Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar has been stuck in the single digits. Klobuchar has permitted herself to blame her own standing at least in part on sexism, noting, \"Women are held to a higher standard.\" Which is true, but not entirely: There are new and very real advantages to being a female candidate in America today. Yet, it would be a mistake to underestimate the extent to which female authority figures trigger hostility in sectors of the electorate. And women themselves are hardly monolithic; when Warren tweeted about billionaires, there materialized a thread of responses accusing her of pandering-presumably, to female voters-and others accusing her of not pandering enough. As she attempts to find her voice on women's rights, Warren seems to be defining feminism as confronting the male ruling class, especially its economic entitlement, head-on, but not always in an explicitly gendered way. And she is showing how that is done.</p><p>'Her brand of feminism then was to ... look at the data'</p><p>Not everybody saw Elizabeth Warren, early on, as standing apart from the organized women's movement. To some of her male colleagues, she seemed plenty feminist, especially given the culture against which she was contending. \"It wasn't so much that she sat around talking all the time about what will we do with women's issues, but whenever it came up, in terms of her life and hiring women, she was very strong and vocal,\" says her University of Texas colleague Jay Westbrook. \"She was also someone who didn't become Janie-one-note on that score, as a fair number of women-understandably at that time-did.\" Westbrook adds, \"My not necessarily advanced colleagues-they respected that.\"</p><p>In some ways, even this degree of restraint is astonishing, given the sexism Warren faced coming of age before the feminist movement had begun to illuminate a path for smart, ambitious women. Warren's own early traditionalism can doubtless be traced to her mother, who-as Warren recalls in her 2014 memoir, A Fighting Chance-warned her daughter not to become \"one of those crazy women's libbers.\" Instead, she wanted \"Betsy\" to marry a good provider, a goal that reflected the family's own acute economic insecurity. As she often recounts, Warren's coming-of-age moment-and core life trauma-happened when she saw her distraught mother wiggle into a too-small dress in order to apply for a job answering phones at Sears, after her father had a heart attack and lost his job, creating deep financial stress of which she was all too aware.</p><p>But at a time when discrimination was so rife, and so legal, that some high schools wouldn't let a girl run for student council president, Warren won a spot as anchor on her high school debate team, where, she writes, she learned that \"I could fight-not with my fists, but with my words.\" When she won a debating scholarship to George Washington University, Warren remembers being warned, \"It was harder for a woman with a college education to find a husband.\" She struggled to escape that mindset, at first unsuccessfully: At 19, she left college to come back home and marry her high school boyfriend, Jim Warren. She resumed her undergraduate work in Houston; then, when her new husband's work took them to New Jersey, started working in a public school. But once she became pregnant, she wrote, she was not asked back. While some news outlets have pushed back against her account of pregnancy discrimination, it is all too believable in an era when this was laughably routine.</p><p>A mother now, she tried to resign herself to a life of house-wifery, but there was a different Elizabeth Warren screaming to emerge. \"The women's movement was exploding around the country, but not in our quiet New Jersey suburb and certainly not in our little family,\" she writes. \"I wanted to be a good wife and mother, but I wanted to do something more.\" Her husband agreed she could enter law school at Rutgers. Upon graduation, she says, law firms looked askance at the fact that she was pregnant with their second child, but she found her way into teaching legal writing, first in New Jersey, then back in Texas after her husband was transferred again. But Jim Warren resented her nondomesticity-she was a terrible cook-and the time she spent grading papers. Child care was a nightmare until her Aunt Bee arrived, but that didn't fix the underlying problem. Warren asked him whether he wanted a divorce, and he said yes. Fighting her way out of a constrictive marriage was a first step in self-transformation; at a legal conference, she fell in love with Bruce Mann, who was light years ahead of his time in his willingness to commute when Warren got a permanent teaching job at UT.</p><p>In Texas, Warren set about building a name for herself as a woman in a man's field-commercial law-where, perhaps without knowing it, she brought a distinctively female viewpoint. \"I headed straight for the money courses,\" she wrote. Up to then, bankruptcy law tended to focus on the perspectives of banks and corporations; the prevailing view was that Americans who declared bankruptcy were deadbeats and lavish spenders. But along with Westbrook and sociologist Teresa Sullivan, Warren examined court records and found that-contrary to stereotype-most Americans declaring bankruptcy were middle-class citizens set back by a medical bill, job loss or other financial disaster. Not only that, but Warren would later observe that women suffer more severely from restrictive bankruptcy rules and regulations due to their greater economic vulnerability, related to pay inequities, single parenthood and child care responsibilities. In her book The Two-Income Trap, published in 2003 with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, Warren pointed out that mothers and fathers alike were affected by drastic changes in the American economy, but \"it is mothers who have been the special targets of change.\" Women had entered the work force en masse, retained responsibility for most housework and still had to \"preserve the remnants of family in the aftermath of divorce.\"</p><p>Although she was calling attention to women's unique financial plight, it's fair to say that Warren did much of her work outside the feminist movement. At the University of Pennsylvania-where she relocated in 1987, when the school hired her and Mann as a couple-and elsewhere, feminist scholars were endeavoring to make the culture of legal education more hospitable to women and students of color. The 1990s were \"a vibrant time,\" recalls one of Warren's students, Melissa Jacoby, in part because female students were now pouring in. One target was the storied Socratic classroom method, which-to oversimplify-consists of calling on students in a formal, intimidating atmosphere, often to expose how much they do not yet know. Warren, recalls Jacoby, took a different approach: She employed a tough questioning style, but worked to make sure everybody in the class was called on, often more than once, approaching class discussions like an orchestra conductor. \"It was honestly one of the most empowering classrooms I've ever been in. ... It really does equalize voices in a law school classroom,\" Jacoby says. \"It was a very lively and electric class,\" adds Charles Fried, who served as Ronald Reagan's solicitor general and was Warren's colleague in her next job, at Harvard.</p><p>A number of women students followed Warren into commercial and bankruptcy law, without having started with that in mind. \"I spent a lot of time with her as a student,\" recalls Abbye Atkinson, who studied with Warren at Harvard and worked as an assistant on what by now had become a long-running bankruptcy research project; Atkinson now teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, looking at the impact of debt and credit on the economically disenfranchised. \"Her brand of feminism then was to really look on the ground, look at the data, look at how debt was affecting Americans generally. How women fared,\" Atkinson says. </p><p>In 2002, when Warren was asked to contribute an article for the 25th anniversary of the Harvard Women's Law Journal, she wrote an essay making what had become a central argument and insight: Bankruptcy and related issues-debt, credit, mortgages, payday and student loans-should be seen as women's issues. The term should not just be reserved for matters involving women's bodies or family-related topics. In her essay, Warren called out Senator Joe Biden, who, she argued, was carrying water for \"the CEOs of the credit industry,\" which was headquartered in his home state of Delaware, by backing a bill that would make it harder for people to seek bankruptcy relief. She took aim at Biden's claims to be a strong voice on behalf of women, as evidenced by his championing of the Violence Against Women Act: \"He is simply the most visible example of legislators who daily weigh the effect of proposed legislation on women and on other interest groups, deciding when to stand up for women and when to take a pass,\" she wrote tartly. And she argued that the group most likely to be adversely affected by the proposed new law were \"women, particularly women heads of households supporting children.\" </p><p>She also criticized the way some feminists had ignored this demographic. \"The women who are struggling the hardest to maintain some semblance of middle-class lives for themselves and their children are not always on the agenda of their most politically active sisters.\" Unspoken here is that the feminist movement often was largely upper-middle class, a failing that has been called out many times. Warren's feminism was, in a way, radical for being more economically inclusive.</p><p>She brought these ideas with her into politics. In her statement, Warren said: \"In 2012, I focused my Senate campaign on middle-class economic security and crumbling infrastructure. Those are issues that profoundly-and sometimes disproportionately-affect women. But no one called them 'women's issues.'\"</p><p>'She is being much more authentically herself'</p><p>Warren became a much more public feminist symbol inadvertently in 2017-when, as the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts, she was speaking during the confirmation hearing of Jeff Sessions to be U.S. attorney general, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shushed her. Or rather, tried to. The senator from Massachusetts would not be shushed, much to McConnell's dismay and disdain. \"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,\" he fussed. With that memorable phrase, a thousand hashtags bloomed. \"She really became this icon for women and women's empowerment,\" says Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers.</p><p>When Warren entered the presidential race-at the outset one of six female Democratic primary contenders-it was Gillibrand who worked to present herself as a feminist first and foremost. In some ways, this was because all the candidates were jostling to differentiate themselves, with Harris presenting more as a candidate of color, Klobuchar as a champion of bipartisanship and Warren as a generator of a zillion policy proposals, including on child care, abortion rights and maternal mortality. With Gillibrand and Harris now out of the race, it can be expected that Warren and Klobuchar will increasingly speak about women's issues. When Klobuchar complained about women being held to a higher standard, for example, she was alluding to scholarship suggesting female politicians must prove their competence and likability, a burden that doesn't fall on, say, Bernie Sanders or Pete Buttigieg. Warren, so far, seems to be skirting the more negative aspects of gender: At an African American women's event in Houston this past spring, she spoke powerfully about her life story, but, asked point-blank whether women face greater problems getting elected, Warren delivered a comic side-eye and then started talking about her mother and how you fight for people you love.</p><p>At the same time, \"she is being much more authentically herself than we have seen,\" Walsh says. Not that long ago, female candidates were told to downplay their roles as wives and mothers and-essentially-run as men. In the run-up to her 2008 presidential campaign, consultant Mark Penn warned Hillary Clinton that the country wasn't ready for \"someone who would be the first mama,\" but that voters were \"open to the first father being a woman.\" His approach was to urge Clinton to, in effect, \"quote-unquote neutralize\" gender, says Kelly Dittmar, a scholar with the Center for American Women and Politics. So that's how Clinton ran the first time: \"She would clearly say, I'm not running as a woman, almost to the point where you saw voters get frustrated with it, particularly woman voters,\" Dittmar says. By 2016, Clinton felt freer to campaign as a woman, though she encountered starkly sexist moments, as when Donald Trump stalked behind her on the debate stage.</p><p>By the 2018 midterm cycle, a new crop of female candidates were able to bring their whole selves to their races, touting their careers-as fighter pilots, military officers, spies-and their roles as daughters and mothers. Moreover, in the post #MeToo era, talking about the discrimination and harassment they overcame is a way for women to prove they are tough. A recent analysis by the Barbara Lee Foundation said voters respond well when women run as \"360 degree candidates,\" showcasing their full range of life experience and touting their expertise while also \"embracing family.\" </p><p>Not to mention that Democratic voters are becoming more female. Women cast 60 percent of Democratic votes in the 2018 midterm elections, and the gender gap between the parties has widened in the past several years. Over that time, the Republican Party has tacked in an antifeminist direction (remember Todd Akin and \"legitimate rape?\" Virginia Republicans and \"transvaginal ultrasound?\") culminating in the election of a president against whom a number of women have charged sexual harassment or assault. As a result, Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg says, \"Post-2016, there is a strong desire by Democratic women to vote for women candidates.\" Rather than the feminization of the Democratic Party, Greenberg calls it the \"feministing of the party.\" That is to say, it's not just that the party is increasingly female; it's increasingly feminist.</p><p>The problem is, studies also show that gender remains, as ever, polarizing, and that \"hostile sexism,\" which is to say, antipathy toward feminism, is one impulse that drove conservative voters to vote for Trump, for whom a majority of white women cast ballots. Studies also show that voters have a harder time voting women into executive leadership; there are more women than ever in Congress but only nine serving as governors. And, this fall, a New York Times poll of voters in battleground states found that 41 percent of voters who supported Biden but not Warren said they see most of the women running for president as unlikable. \"I wish she'd say less about fighting,\" worries Westbrook, her old colleague.</p><p>If Warren makes it past the hurdles in her own party, there remains Trump, the most \"gendered\" opponent imaginable. Warren in the past has needled his masculinity, tweeting during the 2016 campaign that he and future Vice President Mike Pence were \"small, insecure, weak men,\" and calling Trump \"a pathetic coward who can't handle the fact that he's losing to a girl.\" Were Warren to win the nomination, she might be better situated to call out Trump for sexism than Hillary Clinton was because she doesn't have the baggage of being married to Bill Clinton. \"I think she can hit a lot harder,\" says Jennifer Lawless, a politics professor at the University of Virginia. </p><p>Whether taking on the boy's club will help or hurt her, it's indisputable that Warren has been training all her life to challenge the purported billionaire man currently occupying the White House. The presidency is the ultimate male-dominated field-just the kind of arena Warren has spent her career trying to crack into-and the 2020 contest will put her now-not-so-stealth feminism to the test. If Trump were to stalk behind Warren during a debate, says Walsh, \"I would expect a level of fearlessness from her. She is not going to be cautious with him.\"</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-1234260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVV-3G31-F118-93W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4218\"/><timeReceived>11:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 24, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUNDMzNDMDk5NDEzNEFBMUFBMERBMTM0NzMwQzk0MkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REJBMzExNTBFQTI1NDdFM0E0NUZDNjYzRTcyOTA2MjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Labor &amp;

Her approach to companies such as Google and Apple is having a ripple effect around the globe, influencing regulatory action not only in the US but in countries including Brazil, India and Russia.</p><p>The EU has established a reputation in recent years for being one of the world's toughest enforcers of anti-trust law. On the technology front, Brussels and individual European governments have gone after companies in areas such as competition, taxation, privacy and hate speech.</p><p>European nations are preparing to enforce a strict new data-protection law, and EU regulators are increasingly interested in the potential abuse of data and -algorithms.</p><p>The US, which for years regulated the internet only lightly, is now starting to reconsider its -approach. In recent weeks, -indignation over Facebook's disclosure that a British-owned firm improperly tapped and retained information on millions of Facebook users has led US federal and state authorities to announce investigations of the social media company and raised the spectre of new US legislation.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will appear before a House committee next week. During her nearly four years as the EU's competition commissioner, Vestager has completed multiple investigations into US tech companies. Many probes began under her predecessor, but it was under her watch that the EU fined Google, ordered Apple to repay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in alleged unpaid taxes to Ireland, and this year hit Qualcomm with a nearly \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn fine for payments it made to Apple that the EU said were illegal.</p><p>That hasn't made her popular in Silicon Valley, where corporate executives complain that she has unfairly singled out big US technology firms to make examples of them. Some tech firm officials also grumble that Vestager appears keenly interested in how her cases play in the press.</p><p>Google has appealed the EU's ruling against it, saying its logic and conclusions are flawed. In a 2016 interview with an Irish newspaper, Apple chief executive Tim Cook called the EU's allegation that the company had paid an -ultra low tax rate in Ireland \"total political crap\", adding \"they just picked another number from I don't know where\".</p><p>Apple and Ireland both -appealed against the EU's decision, contending Apple paid all the tax it owed and received no special treatment. Qualcomm also has said it would appeal.</p><p>Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based think tank backed by technology companies including Google, says US tech companies \"make big, juicy targets\" for Vestager. \"This is a very popular position for her to take in Europe.\" Since 2010, when the EU began probing Google's alleged abuse of its dominant search engine and, later, its Android mobile operating system, Brazil, India and Russia all opened their own anti-trust investigations into the company. Russia and India have issued fines. (Google settled the Russian case and is considering whether to appeal in India.) Four Brazilian investigations into Google are pending.</p><p>\"You get to learn from a lot of work that's being done over there,\" says Eduardo Frade, former general superintendent of Brazil's anti-trust regulator, who helped open the country's probes into Google in 2013.</p><p>Last month, South Korea's anti-trust regulator - which Google's security filings suggest is also investigating the company - said it is considering updating its merger review criteria, now based on revenue thresholds, so it can review deals involving companies with high valuations but little sales, such as when Facebook bought WhatsApp for $US22bn in 2014. Vestager in 2016 advocated a similar change, which the European Commission is considering.</p><p>Vestager has sway beyond -Europe's borders in part because of the EU's administrative law system, which empowers her to issue punishments and order remedies before any judicial review.</p><p>That gives her more leeway than anti-trust enforcers in other countries. In the US, anti-trust enforcers have to go to court to seek financial penalties for anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>The US and Canada have closed anti-trust investigations against Google without charges.</p><p>\"Because the (European) system allows that broader discretion, you see more of these cases being tested,\" says Antonio Capobianco, senior competition expert at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which hosts an annual global meeting of competition enforcers. \"A lot of jurisdictions have tended to look at Europe more than the US as a model.\" Vestager has used that power to try to stretch competition law to cover issues unique to the internet age. In her decisions, she has emphasised the EU legal doctrine that dominant companies have a special responsibility not to abuse their power.</p><p>That differs from the approach taken by US anti-trust enforcers. They advocate taking action against companies only in cases where consumers are harmed, so as not to stifle innovation, particularly in the digital space.</p><p>\"Where there is no demonstrable harm to competition and consumers, we are reluctant to impose special duties on digital platforms,\" Justice Department's anti-trust chief Makan Delrahim said at a recent speech in Brussels.</p><p>In 2015, Barack Obama said in an interview with the website -Recode that the EU's investigations into US tech companies such as Google and Facebook were \"more commercially driven than anything else\". \"Their service providers - who, you know, can't compete with ours - are essentially trying to set up some roadblocks for our companies to operate effectively there.\" Senior EU officials deny that the decisions are designed to target US companies, saying tech companies that want access to -Europe's 500 million consumers must play by the bloc's rules. Vestager has said she can find no evidence of anti-US bias in her investigations.</p><p>Since assuming her position in late 2014, Vestager has defended her competition investigations into large tech companies as a means to ensure fairness for smaller rivals and average citizens. \"If people see that the law is actually enforced for everyone, then I, being maybe a small player, have a fair fighting chance,\" she says.</p><p>Vestager is known in Brussels for communicating priorities in a plain-spoken manner - a contrast to the regulatory jargon often thrown around by members of the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm. She bakes cinnamon rolls for her team, has sewn her own gala dress and was seen earlier this year knitting on an airport floor. She regularly flies back to Denmark to see her husband, a high school maths teacher, and three daughters.</p><p>She grew up in rural Denmark, the eldest of four children of two Lutheran pastors. She has nodded to her religious upbringing when discussing her views on business and competition. \"What is at stake is as old as Adam and Eve,\" she said in a recent speech.</p><p>\"It all comes down to greed.\" She studied economics at the University of Copenhagen, where she became politically active. She entered politics at age 29, rose to lead her centrist party and, in 2011, helped form a coalition government. Her early embrace of social media led many Danes to call her The Queen of Twitter.</p><p>In 2014, when EU members named delegates to five-year terms on the European Commission, Denmark's prime minister sent Vestager. She was appointed competition commissioner. -Al-ready on her desk were prominent and politically sensitive cases began by her predecessor, including anti-trust investigations into Google and Russian state-owned natural gas company, Gazprom, and probes into Apple and Amazon's tax arrangements with European governments.</p><p>She came out swinging. In April 2015, she intensified a long-running Google probe, which her predecessor had tried to settle, by issuing formal charges. Her office accused Google of abusing the dominance of its search engine to send traffic to its own shopping ads while burying results for rival shopping sites. (News Corp, owner of The Australian, is an interested third party in the case and has formally complained to the EU about Google's handling of news articles in search results.) It was a departure from the US approach to big tech at that time. The Federal Trade Commission in 2013 closed a probe into Google's search practices after the company agreed to voluntary changes.</p><p>Days after issuing charges, Vestager flew to Washington for a gathering of anti-trust enforcers hosted by the American Bar -Association. She took the stage with other top enforcers in front of several hundred people. The US Justice Department and FTC gave recaps of their year's work, according to people present.</p><p>Vestager presented her argument for taking on global businesses, noting that she is \"willing to see them in court when necessary,\" according to a transcript of the event. She acknowledged differences with the US approach and made the case for international co-operation and intervention against big firms when necessary. \"As businesses have grown global, I think it has been a challenge for society, for law enforcement, to follow,\" she said. \"We will use every tool in the toolbox in order to get a fair and level playing field.\" Silicon Valley executives began visiting Brussels to gauge Vestager's approach and attempt to sway cases she was pursuing.</p><p>Apple's Cook visited in January 2016, eight months before Vestager ordered Apple to pay Ireland \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in taxes the EU says the company would have owed if not for a favourable deal with Dublin.</p><p>Apple representatives realised going into that meeting that the EU's tab could be large, a source says. The discussion got somewhat heated, this person says, and Cook interrupted Vestager several times as he sought to argue that the bulk of the company's profits were generated in - and therefore should be attributed to - the US, not Ireland.</p><p>When it filed its appeal later that year, Apple said: \"It's been clear since the start of this case there was a predetermined outcome.\" That November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai met Vestager. He spent much of the one-hour meeting exchanging pleasantries, seemingly in an effort to build a rapport, says a source.</p><p>Then he pivoted to the Google arguments in the case.</p><p>Vestager strongly implied that her team -already aimed to decide against the company, according to sources.</p><p>As proof that Google elbowed aside rival shopping services, Vestager's team in their decision cited data they said showed rivals' online \"visibility\" plunged in search results. Last June, days before Vestager announced the decision against Google, analysis firm Sistrix, which supplied some data, suggested its information was misinterpreted and said it could find no evidence Google put competitors at a disadvantage.</p><p>\"In my view, the EU Commission doesn't understand the fundamental contexts of internet search,\" Sistrix CEO Johannes Beus said in a blog post.</p><p>The commission's 215-page finding against Google cited data sources besides Sistrix, including confidential Google data that Brussels reviewed. Google has said its products help consumers and comply with competition laws.</p><p>Vestager, whose five-year mandate ends next year, already has raised her hand to serve a second term, which would be unusual. The move was partly intended to ratchet down media speculation that Vestager could be a contender to become president of the next European Commission, a source said.She recently appointed three competition professors to advise her for the next year on digital -issues such as the competition implications of artificial intelligence. She has multiple cases pending, including at least two against Google.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-77e26bb8394511e8bfbccc68e75d300a671cf86308f59d54f88d4de9d1829e98</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1X-HH01-F0JP-W4TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2052\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 7, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>QCOM (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Energy &amp;

The Known Citizen: A History of Privacy in Modern America. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. 569 pp. US$35.00. Hardcover. ISBN: 978674737501.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sarah E. Igo's impressive The Known Citizen: A Histon&gt; of Privacy in Modern America is less a history of \"privacy\" per se and more a demonstration of how privacy has become foundational to Americans' sense of personhood and national identity. It is more about \"privacy talk\" as an \"index to changing ideas about society itself' (8). She doesn't define privacy; that would be inappropriate and unnecessary. Rather, the volume serves as a documentation of how new \"privacy talk\" replaces old \"privacy talk\" and of how the discourse has been shaped and manipulated to frame and understand varied social and political conflicts over the extent to which citizens are, or should be, known to others.</p><p>The book is elegantly written and extensively documented with sources from a variety of academic disciplines and media outlets. The story told is a messy and contradictory one. Each chapter documents a different national conversation about privacy and disclosure and explores how privacy is invoked to challenge and understand quite different social and technological problems. These different episodes do not accumulate into a coherent and linear story in which one phase of privacy discourse gives way to another. Rather, the book stands as a testament to the versatility of the concept and, thus, its endurance in the popular imagination. Privacy stands as a \"counterweight to a knowing society, an attempt to calibrate the balance between the knowers and the known\" (19).</p><p>To be sure, Igo offers some interesting insights about shifts in discourse and understanding. The first chapter (\"Technologies of Publicity\") demonstrates how privacy shifted from a property-based to a personalitybased concept. Chapter Two (\"Documents of Identity\") offers a fascinating account of the early processes of bureaucratic identification through the use of the social security number and the Social Security Administration. These early efforts of citizen identification were not so much resisted as overly intrusive government surveillance but embraced as a claim of national membership, and as beneficent and positive identification as a \"known citizen\" (97). Chapter Three (\"The Porous Psyche\") documents the growing rhetoric about \"privacy invasion\" and the \"vanishing boundary between the self and the social world\" (99) as well as the growing sense of suffocation and normalization within the emerging consumer culture and suburbanization of American life in the 1950s.</p><p>Chapter Four (\"A Right to be Let Alone\") contains an interesting account of the entry of a right to privacy into US constitutional law through Griswold v. Connecticut and its \"progeny.\" The history demonstrates how \"people\" rather than \"places\" became the locus of privacy rights and shows the shaky and contested ground upon which those rights continue to be based, regardless of the uncontested influence of the 1890 formulation of a \"right to be let alone\" by Warren and Brandeis. Chapter Five (\"Codes of Confidentiality and Consent\") shifts focus to academic research and explores the ethics of privacy that entered the scholarly community after the furores over controversial social science studies such as The Tearoom Trade (1970) by Laud Humphreys. Chapter Six (\"The Record Prison\") traces concerns about national databanks in the 1960s, the emergent rhetoric about the \"surveillance society,\" and the limited and fragmentary statutory responses. Chapter Seven (\"The Ethic of Transparency\") explores the culture of exposure emerging from \"reality TV\" programs and widespread obsession with the private lives of public figures.</p><p>The book culminates in a chapter (\"Stories of One's Self') on the contemporary \"confessional culture.\" The current obsession with self-disclosure through social media has its roots in a whole genre of television programs that propelled private stories to the public arena-the PBS documentary series An American Family (1973) being the most notable. Igo correctly refuses to read the confessional culture as a testament to the disappearance of privacy. Rather, she sees it as a re-orientation of privacy. Privacy and the \"right to tell one's story\" are two sides of the same coin. Privacy is no longer about finding a place to hide or securing a \"right to be let alone\" but about the right to control the circulation of one's information and image.</p><p>Her concluding chapter does not try for any overall synthesis but instead attempts to interpret the contemporary angst about the networked self within the context of ubiquitous connectivity and in terms of these historic contestations. Perhaps there is no appropriate conclusion to this incomplete, episodic, and complex story. Rather, the reader gets the impression of quite separate privacy conversations, with tenuous overlap or cross-fertilization. The \"privacy talk\" about the \"right to be let alone\" rarely influences the debate about research ethics. The constitutional debates about privacy in the penumbra of the Constitution seem to have little to do with the statutory protections about administrative record-keeping. The emergence of confessional culture occurs despite a growing privacy advocacy lobby and the widespread availability of privacy-enhancing technologies to the average citizen.</p><p>The book also gives the impression that the \"American\" privacy discourse is an insular one, rarely influenced by conversations on similar issues from overseas or by the larger forces of globalization. This message may not have been an intended, but the text contains few references to social and political events, or scholarly and cultural writings, outside the boundaries of the United States. This may infuriate some readers within the surveillance studies community, which is, of course, inherently transnational in its profile and orientation.</p><p>In some respects, the American privacy story is different from that elsewhere. Issues that would barely raise alarm in other countries are matters of intense dispute in the US. But Igo rarely reflects on these comparative differences. This is essentially and deliberately an American story told by a skilled American historian.</p><p>Igo self-consciously admits that the text contains few lessons for those who wish to challenge \"surveillance capitalism\" and the platform economy. Those who are looking for sustained analysis of the surveillance state and the power of big tech corporations, like Google and Facebook, are likely to be disappointed. Edward Snowden gets just one brief mention. But I believe there may be a lesson here that perhaps deserves a more sustained concluding analysis. Privacy is \"broad, abstract and ambiguous\" according to US Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 1965). Its malleability accounts for its position as a powerful device through which so many American social trends and conflicts are framed. But that malleability also permits the concept to be (mis)appropriated and repackaged through meaningless tropes. The platitude \"Your privacy is important to us,\" repeated and repackaged in so many \"privacy\" policies, stands as a telling indication that privacy is perhaps everywhere in American culture-and yet nowhere.</p><p>Thus, some might read this work as testament to the broader thesis within the surveillance studies literature that \"privacy,\" both as a discourse and a scheme of regulation, is profoundly inadequate to challenge the structural effects of surveillance (see, e.g., Bennett 2011). Igo does not engage with that larger argument except to say that the many questions framed by the privacy debate are as salient today as they were when Warren and Brandeis allegedly invented the idea in 1890-which, of course, they did not. She merely insists that the particular information constellation of the twenty-first century, where \"profit, security and selfdefinition mingle indiscriminately\" (357), can be better understood if viewed through the lens of historical efforts to render citizens transparent.</p><p>Therefore, there is no \"end of privacy,\" and pronouncements about its death are misleading and self-serving. Rather, privacy shapes an enduring, tense, and uncertain conversation. And, as much as surveillance scholars resist privacy discourse and privacy regulation as the antidote to surveillance, the word, with its many ambiguities and connotations, is not going away-at least not in the United States.</p><p>References</p><p>Bennett, Colin J. 2011.

Tech industry executives ''argued that they were capable of regulating themselves and that government intervention would be costly and counterproductive.'' Civil libertarians warned that the companies' data capabilities posed ''an unprecedented threat to individual freedom.'' One observed, ''We have to decide what human beings are in the electronic age. Are we just going to be chattel for commerce?'' A commissioner asked, ''Where should we draw the line?'' The year was 1997.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The line was never drawn, and the executives got their way. Twenty-three years later the evidence is in. The fruit of that victory was a new economic logic that I call ''surveillance capitalism.'' Its success depends upon one-way-mirror operations engineered for our ignorance and wrapped in a fog of misdirection, euphemism and mendacity. It rooted and flourished in the new spaces of the internet, once celebrated by surveillance capitalists as ''the world's largest ungoverned space.'' But power fills a void, and those once wild spaces are no longer ungoverned. Instead, they are owned and operated by private surveillance capital and governed by its iron laws. </p><p>  The rise of surveillance capitalism over the last two decades went largely unchallenged. ''Digital'' was fast, we were told, and stragglers would be left behind. It's not surprising that so many of us rushed to follow the bustling White Rabbit down his tunnel into a promised digital Wonderland where, like Alice, we fell prey to delusion. In Wonderland, we celebrated the new digital services as free, but now we see that the surveillance capitalists behind those services regard us as the free commodity. We thought that we search Google, but now we understand that Google searches us. We assumed that we use social media to connect, but we learned that connection is how social media uses us. We barely questioned why our new TV or mattress had a privacy policy, but we've begun to understand that ''privacy'' policies are actually surveillance policies.</p><p>  And like our forebears who named the automobile ''horseless carriage'' because they could not reckon with its true dimension, we regarded the internet platforms as ''bulletin boards'' where anyone could pin a note. Congress cemented this delusion in a statute, Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, absolving those companies of the obligations that adhere to ''publishers'' or even to ''speakers.''</p><p>  Only repeated crises have taught us that these platforms are not bulletin boards but hyper-velocity global bloodstreams into which anyone may introduce a dangerous virus without a vaccine. This is how Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, could legally refuse to remove a faked video of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and later double down on this decision, announcing that political advertising would not be subject to fact-checking.</p><p>  All of these delusions rest on the most treacherous hallucination of them all: the belief that privacy is private. We have imagined that we can choose our degree of privacy with an individual calculation in which a bit of personal information is traded for valued services -- a reasonable quid pro quo. For example, when Delta Air Lines piloted a biometric data system at the Atlanta airport, the company reported that of nearly 25,000 customers who traveled there each week, 98 percent opted into the process, noting that ''the facial recognition option is saving an average of two seconds for each customer at boarding, or nine minutes when boarding a wide body aircraft.''</p><p>  In fact the rapid development of facial recognition systems reveals the public consequences of this supposedly private choice. Surveillance capitalists have demanded the right to take our faces wherever they appear -- on a city street or a Facebook page. The Financial Times reported that a Microsoft facial recognition training database of 10 million images plucked from the internet without anyone's knowledge and supposedly limited to academic research was employed by companies like IBM and state agencies that included the United States and Chinese military. Among these were two Chinese suppliers of equipment to officials in Xinjiang, where members of the Uighur community live in open-air prisons under perpetual surveillance by facial recognition systems.</p><p>  Privacy is not private, because the effectiveness of these and other private or public surveillance and control systems depends upon the pieces of ourselves that we give up -- or that are secretly stolen from us.</p><p>  Our digital century was to have been democracy's Golden Age. Instead, we enter its third decade marked by a stark new form of social inequality best understood as ''epistemic inequality.'' It recalls a pre-Gutenberg era of extreme asymmetries of knowledge and the power that accrues to such knowledge, as the tech giants seize control of information and learning itself. The delusion of ''privacy as private'' was crafted to breed and feed this unanticipated social divide. Surveillance capitalists exploit the widening inequity of knowledge for the sake of profits. They manipulate the economy, our society and even our lives with impunity, endangering not just individual privacy but democracy itself. Distracted by our delusions, we failed to notice this bloodless coup from above.</p><p>  The belief that privacy is private has left us careening toward a future that we did not choose, because it failed to reckon with the profound distinction between a society that insists upon sovereign individual rights and one that lives by the social relations of the one-way mirror. The lesson is that privacy is public -- it is a collective good that is logically and morally inseparable from the values of human autonomy and self-determination upon which privacy depends and without which a democratic society is unimaginable.</p><p>  Still, the winds appear to have finally shifted. A fragile new awareness is dawning as we claw our way back up the rabbit hole toward home. Surveillance capitalists are fast because they seek neither genuine consent nor consensus. They rely on psychic numbing and messages of inevitability to conjure the helplessness, resignation and confusion that paralyze their prey. Democracy is slow, and that's a good thing. Its pace reflects the tens of millions of conversations that occur in families, among neighbors, co-workers and friends, within communities, cities and states, gradually stirring the sleeping giant of democracy to action.</p><p>  These conversations are occurring now, and there are many indications that lawmakers are ready to join and to lead. This third decade is likely to decide our fate. Will we make the digital future better, or will it make us worse? Will it be a place that we can call home?</p><p>  Epistemic inequality is not based on what we can earn but rather on what we can learn. It is defined as unequal access to learning imposed by private commercial mechanisms of information capture, production, analysis and sales. It is best exemplified in the fast-growing abyss between what we know and what is known about us.</p><p>  Twentieth-century industrial society was organized around the ''division of labor,'' and it followed that the struggle for economic equality would shape the politics of that time. Our digital century shifts society's coordinates from a division of labor to a ''division of learning,'' and it follows that the struggle over access to knowledge and the power conferred by such knowledge will shape the politics of our time.</p><p>  The new centrality of epistemic inequality signals a power shift from the ownership of the means of production, which defined the politics of the 20th century, to the ownership of the production of meaning. The challenges of epistemic justice and epistemic rights in this new era are summarized in three essential questions about knowledge, authority and power: Who knows? Who decides who knows? Who decides who decides who knows?</p><p>  During the last two decades, the leading surveillance capitalists -- Google, later followed by Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft -- helped to drive this societal transformation while simultaneously ensuring their ascendance to the pinnacle of the epistemic hierarchy. They operated in the shadows to amass huge knowledge monopolies by taking without asking, a maneuver that every child recognizes as theft. Surveillance capitalism begins by unilaterally staking a claim to private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Our lives are rendered as data flows.</p><p>  Early on, it was discovered that, unknown to users, even data freely given harbors rich predictive signals, a surplus that is more than what is required for service improvement. It isn't only what you post online, but whether you use exclamation points or the color saturation of your photos; not just where you walk but the stoop of your shoulders; not just the identity of your face but the emotional states conveyed by your ''microexpressions''; not just what you like but the pattern of likes across engagements. Soon this behavioral surplus was secretly hunted and captured, claimed as proprietary data.</p><p>  The data are conveyed through complex supply chains of devices, tracking and monitoring software, and ecosystems of apps and companies that specialize in niche data flows captured in secret. For example, testing by The Wall Street Journal showed that Facebook receives heart rate data from the Instant Heart Rate: HR Monitor, menstrual cycle data from the Flo Period &amp; Ovulation Tracker, and data that reveal interest in real estate properties from Realtor.com -- all of it without the user's knowledge.</p><p>  These data flows empty into surveillance capitalists' computational factories, called ''artificial intelligence,'' where they are manufactured into behavioral predictions that are about us, but they are not for us. Instead, they are sold to business customers in a new kind of market that trades exclusively in human futures. Certainty in human affairs is the lifeblood of these markets, where surveillance capitalists compete on the quality of their predictions. This is a new form of trade that birthed some of the richest and most powerful companies in history.</p><p>  In order to achieve their objectives, the leading surveillance capitalists sought to establish unrivaled dominance over the 99.9 percent of the world's information now rendered in digital formats that they helped to create. Surveillance capital has built most of the world's largest computer networks, data centers, populations of servers, undersea transmission cables, advanced microchips, and frontier machine intelligence, igniting an arms race for the 10,000 or so specialists on the planet who know how to coax knowledge from these vast new data continents.</p><p>  With Google in the lead, the top surveillance capitalists seek to control labor markets in critical expertise, including data science and animal research, elbowing out competitors such as start-ups, universities, high schools, municipalities, established corporations in other industries and less wealthy countries. In 2016, 57 percent of American computer science Ph.D. graduates took jobs in industry, while only 11 percent became tenure-track faculty members. It's not just an American problem. In Britain, university administrators contemplate a ''missing generation'' of data scientists. A Canadian scientist laments, ''the power, the expertise, the data are all concentrated in the hands of a few companies.''</p><p>Google created the first insanely lucrative markets to trade in human futures, what we now know as online targeted advertising, based on their predictions of which ads users would click. Between 2000, when the new economic logic was just emerging, and 2004, when the company went public, revenues increased by 3,590 percent. This startling number represents the ''surveillance dividend.'' It quickly reset the bar for investors, eventually driving start-ups, apps developers and established companies to shift their business models toward surveillance capitalism. The promise of a fast track to outsized revenues from selling human futures drove this migration first to Facebook, then through the tech sector and now throughout the rest of the economy to industries as disparate as insurance, retail, finance, education, health care, real estate, entertainment and every product that begins with the word ''smart'' or service touted as ''personalized.''</p><p>  Even Ford, the birthplace of the 20th-century mass production economy, is on the trail of the surveillance dividend, proposing to meet the challenge of slumping car sales by reimagining Ford vehicles as a ''transportation operating system.'' As one analyst put it, Ford ''could make a fortune monetizing data. They won't need engineers, factories or dealers to do it. It's almost pure profit.''</p><p>  Surveillance capitalism's economic imperatives were refined in the competition to sell certainty. Early on it was clear that machine intelligence must feed on volumes of data, compelling economies of scale in data extraction. Eventually it was understood that volume is necessary but not sufficient. The best algorithms also require varieties of data -- economies of scope. This realization helped drive the ''mobile revolution'' sending users into the real world armed with cameras, computers, gyroscopes and microphones packed inside their smart new phones. In the competition for scope, surveillance capitalists want your home and what you say and do within its walls. They want your car, your medical conditions, and the shows you stream; your location as well as all the streets and buildings in your path and all the behavior of all the people in your city. They want your voice and what you eat and what you buy; your children's play time and their schooling; your brain waves and your bloodstream. Nothing is exempt.</p><p>  Unequal knowledge about us produces unequal power over us, and so epistemic inequality widens to include the distance between what we can do and what can be done to us. Data scientists describe this as the shift from monitoring to actuation, in which a critical mass of knowledge about a machine system enables the remote control of that system. Now people have become targets for remote control, as surveillance capitalists discovered that the most predictive data come from intervening in behavior to tune, herd and modify action in the direction of commercial objectives. This third imperative, ''economies of action,'' has become an arena of intense experimentation. ''We are learning how to write the music,'' one scientist said, ''and then we let the music make them dance.''</p><p>  This new power ''to make them dance'' does not employ soldiers to threaten terror and murder. It arrives carrying a cappuccino, not a gun. It is a new ''instrumentarian'' power that works its will through the medium of ubiquitous digital instrumentation to manipulate subliminal cues, psychologically target communications, impose default choice architectures, trigger social comparison dynamics and levy rewards and punishments -- all of it aimed at remotely tuning, herding and modifying human behavior in the direction of profitable outcomes and always engineered to preserve users' ignorance.</p><p>  We saw predictive knowledge morphing into instrumentarian power in Facebook's contagion experiments published in 2012 and 2014, when it planted subliminal cues and manipulated social comparisons on its pages, first to influence users to vote in midterm elections and later to make people feel sadder or happier. Facebook researchers celebrated the success of these experiments noting two key findings: that it was possible to manipulate online cues to influence real world behavior and feelings, and that this could be accomplished while successfully bypassing users' awareness.</p><p>  In 2016, the Google-incubated augmented reality game, Pok\u00e9mon Go, tested economies of action on the streets. Game players did not know that they were pawns in the real game of behavior modification for profit, as the rewards and punishments of hunting imaginary creatures were used to herd people to the McDonald's, Starbucks and local pizza joints that were paying the company for ''footfall,'' in exactly the same way that online advertisers pay for ''click through'' to their websites.</p><p>  In 2017, a leaked Facebook document acquired by The Australian exposed the corporation's interest in applying ''psychological insights'' from ''internal Facebook data'' to modify user behavior. The targets were 6.4 million young Australians and New Zealanders. ''By monitoring posts, pictures, interactions and internet activity in real time,'' the executives wrote, ''Facebook can work out when young people feel 'stressed,' 'defeated,' 'overwhelmed,' 'anxious,' 'nervous,' 'stupid,' 'silly,' 'useless' and a 'failure.''' This depth of information, they explained, allows Facebook to pinpoint the time frame during which a young person needs a ''confidence boost'' and is most vulnerable to a specific configuration of subliminal cues and triggers. The data are then used to match each emotional phase with appropriate ad messaging for the maximum probability of guaranteed sales.</p><p>Facebook denied these practices, though a former product manager accused the company of ''lying through its teeth.'' The fact is that in the absence of corporate transparency and democratic oversight, epistemic inequality rules. They know. They decide who knows. They decide who decides.</p><p>  The public's intolerable knowledge disadvantage is deepened by surveillance capitalists' perfection of mass communications as gaslighting. Two examples are illustrative. On April 30, 2019 Mark Zuckerberg made a dramatic announcement at the company's annual developer conference, declaring, ''The future is private.'' A few weeks later, a Facebook litigator appeared before a federal district judge in California to thwart a user lawsuit over privacy invasion, arguing that the very act of using Facebook negates any reasonable expectation of privacy ''as a matter of law.'' In May 2019 Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, wrote in The Times of his corporations's commitment to the principle that ''privacy cannot be a luxury good.'' Five months later Google contractors were found offering $5 gift cards to homeless people of color in an Atlanta park in return for a facial scan.</p><p>Facebook's denial invites even more scrutiny in light of another leaked company document appearing in 2018. The confidential report offers rare insight into the heart of Facebook's computational factory, where a ''prediction engine'' runs on a machine intelligence platform that ''ingests trillions of data points every day, trains thousands of models'' and then ''deploys them to the server fleet for live predictions.'' Facebook notes that its ''prediction service'' produces ''more than 6 million predictions per second.'' But to what purpose?</p><p>  In its report, the company makes clear that these extraordinary capabilities are dedicated to meeting its corporate customers' ''core business challenges'' with procedures that link prediction, microtargeting, intervention and behavior modification. For example, a Facebook service called ''loyalty prediction'' is touted for its ability to plumb proprietary behavioral surplus to predict individuals who are ''at risk'' of shifting their brand allegiance and alerting advertisers to intervene promptly with targeted messages designed to stabilize loyalty just in time to alter the course of the future.</p><p>  That year a young man named Christopher Wylie turned whistle-blower on his former employer, a political consultancy known as Cambridge Analytica. ''We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,'' Wylie admitted, ''and built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.'' Mr. Wylie characterized those techniques as ''information warfare,'' correctly assessing that such shadow wars are built on asymmetries of knowledge and the power it affords. Less clear to the public or lawmakers was that the political firm's strategies of secret invasion and conquest employed surveillance capitalism's standard operating procedures to which billions of innocent ''users'' are routinely subjected each day. Mr. Wylie described this mirroring process, as he followed a trail that was already cut and marked. Cambridge Analytica's real innovation was to pivot the whole undertaking from commercial to political objectives.</p><p>  In other words, Cambridge Analytica was the parasite, and surveillance capitalism was the host. Thanks to its epistemic dominance, surveillance capitalism provided the behavioral data that exposed the targets for assault. Its methods of behavioral microtargeting and behavioral modification became the weapons. And it was surveillance capitalism's lack of accountability for content on its platform afforded by Section 230 that provided the opportunity for the stealth attacks designed to trigger the inner demons of unsuspecting citizens.</p><p>  It's not just that epistemic inequality leaves us utterly vulnerable to the attacks of actors like Cambridge Analytica. The larger and more disturbing point is that surveillance capitalism has turned epistemic inequality into a defining condition of our societies, normalizing information warfare as a chronic feature of our daily reality prosecuted by the very corporations upon which we depend for effective social participation. They have the knowledge, the machines, the science and the scientists, the secrets and the lies. All privacy now rests with them, leaving us with few means of defense from these marauding data invaders. Without law, we scramble to hide in our own lives, while our children debate encryption strategies around the dinner table and students wear masks to public protests as protection from facial recognition systems built with our family photos.</p><p>  In the absence of new declarations of epistemic rights and legislation, surveillance capitalism threatens to remake society as it unmakes democracy. From below, it undermines human agency, usurping privacy, diminishing autonomy and depriving individuals of the right to combat. From above, epistemic inequality and injustice are fundamentally incompatible with the aspirations of a democratic people.</p><p>  We know that surveillance capitalists work in the shadows, but what they do there and the knowledge they accrue are unknown to us. They have the means to know everything about us, but we can know little about them. Their knowledge of us is not for us. Instead, our futures are sold for others' profits. Since that Federal Trade Commission meeting in 1997, the line was never drawn, and people did become chattel for commerce. Another destructive delusion is that this outcome was inevitable -- an unavoidable consequence of convenience-enhancing digital technologies. The truth is that surveillance capitalism hijacked the digital medium. There was nothing inevitable about it.</p><p>  American lawmakers have been reluctant to take on these challenges for many reasons. One is an unwritten policy of ''surveillance exceptionalism'' forged in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when the government's concerns shifted from online privacy protections to a new zeal for ''total information awareness.'' In that political environment the fledgling surveillance capabilities emerging from Silicon Valley appeared to hold great promise.</p><p>  Surveillance capitalists have also defended themselves with lobbying and forms of propaganda intended to undermine and intimidate lawmakers, confounding judgment and freezing action. These have received relatively little scrutiny compared to the damage they do. Consider two examples:</p><p>  The first is the assertion that democracy threatens prosperity and innovation. Former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt explained in 2011, ''we took the position of 'hands off the internet.' You know, leave us alone ... The government can make regulatory mistakes that can slow this whole thing down, and we see that and we worry about it.'' This propaganda is recycled from the Gilded Age barons, whom we now call ''robbers.'' They insisted that there was no need for law when one had the ''law of survival of the fittest,'' the ''laws of capital'' and the ''law of supply and demand.''</p><p>  Paradoxically, surveillance capital does not appear to drive innovation. A promising new era of economic research shows the critical role that government and democratic governance have played in innovation and suggests a lack of innovation in big tech companies like Google. Surveillance capitalism's information dominance is not dedicated to the urgent challenges of carbon-free energy, eliminating hunger, curing cancers, ridding the oceans of plastic or flooding the world with well paid, smart, loving teachers and doctors. Instead, we see a frontier operation run by geniuses with vast capital and computational power that is furiously dedicated to the lucrative science and economics of human prediction for profit.</p><p>  The second form of propaganda is the argument that the success of the leading surveillance capitalist firms reflects the real value they bring to people. But data from the demand side suggest that surveillance capitalism is better understood as a market failure. Instead of a close alignment of supply and demand, people use these services because they have no comparable alternatives and because they are ignorant of surveillance capitalism's shadow operations and their consequences. Pew Research Center recently reported that 81 percent of Americans believe the potential risks of companies' data collection outweigh the benefits, suggesting that corporate success depends upon coercion and obfuscation rather than meeting people's real needs.</p><p>  In his prizewinning history of regulation, the historian Thomas McCraw delivers a warning. Across the centuries regulators failed when they did not frame ''strategies appropriate to the particular industries they were regulating.'' Existing privacy and antitrust laws are vital but neither will be wholly adequate to the new challenges of reversing epistemic inequality.</p><p>  These contests of the 21st century demand a framework of epistemic rights enshrined in law and subject to democratic governance. Such rights would interrupt data supply chains by safeguarding the boundaries of human experience before they come under assault from the forces of datafication. The choice to turn any aspect of one's life into data must belong to individuals by virtue of their rights in a democratic society. This means, for example, that companies cannot claim the right to your face, or use your face as free raw material for analysis, or own and sell any computational products that derive from your face. The conversation on epistemic rights has already begun, reflected in a pathbreaking report from Amnesty International.</p><p>  On the demand side, we can outlaw human futures markets and thus eliminate the financial incentives that sustain the surveillance dividend. This is not a radical prospect. For example, societies outlaw markets that trade in human organs, babies and slaves. In each case, we recognize that such markets are both morally repugnant and produce predictably violent consequences. Human futures markets can be shown to produce equally predictable outcomes that challenge human freedom and undermine democracy. Like subprime mortgages and fossil fuel investments, surveillance assets will become the new toxic assets.</p><p>  In support of a new competitive landscape, lawmakers will need to champion new forms of collective action, just as nearly a century ago legal protections for the rights to organize, to strike and to bargain collectively united lawmakers and workers in curbing the powers of monopoly capitalists. Lawmakers must seek alliances with citizens who are deeply concerned over the unchecked power of the surveillance capitalists and with workers who seek fair wages and reasonable security in defiance of the precarious employment conditions that define the surveillance economy.</p><p>  Anything made by humans can be unmade by humans. Surveillance capitalism is young, barely 20 years in the making, but democracy is old, rooted in generations of hope and contest.</p><p>  Surveillance capitalists are rich and powerful, but they are not invulnerable. They have an Achilles heel: fear. They fear lawmakers who do not fear them. They fear citizens who demand a new road forward as they insist on new answers to old questions: Who will know? Who will decide who knows? Who will decide who decides? Who will write the music, and who will dance?</p><p>  Shoshana Zuboff (@ShoshanaZuboff) is professor emerita at Harvard Business School and the author of ''The Age of Surveillance Capitalism.''</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

But that didn't stop an army of naysayers from crowing about an imaginary government takeover of the internet or how the new plan would slash their profits. Some chose half-intelligent ways to make those arguments. Others did some pretty dumb stuff.</p><p>Here are some of our favorite crazy statements from America's most concerned leaders. Verizon Might as well start with the dumbest reaction. Verizon, the peddlers of broken fiber optic dreams[3], doesn't like the FCC's plan one bit, and the multibillion-dollar company's army of flacks are being real dipshits about it. Immediately after the vote, Verizon issued a press release drafted in smudged typewriter text and dated February 26, 1934. It's pretty rude:Verizon published the same press release on its corporate blogs. But in lieu of the vintage font, the company posted the release in Morse code:The 1930s line refers to the classic but fatally flawed criticism of the FCC's reclassifying the internet under Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1934[4]. Indeed, Congress passed the bill in 1934 and President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it into law. However, the legislation was then overhauled in 1996, and the new rules explicitly give the FCC the right to forbear [5]any part of the law that aren't relevant to regulating the internet. Also, Morse code is awesome, so your isn't funny, Verizon. Comcast Surprise! Comcast doesn't like the FCC's new net neutrality rules either. This is the same company that has a stranglehold on one out of every three internet users in America[6] who have no other choice of provider, so no surprise there. The company has been famously coy[7] about claiming to love net neutrality but refusing to support the policy that would protect it. Here's that line again from Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen, saying the company embraces the rules and then immediately mocking them, along with another cute 1930s reference:We fully embrace the open Internet principles that have been laid out by President Obama and Chairman Wheeler and that now have been adopted by the FCC. We just don't believe statutory provisions designed for the telephone industry and adopted when Franklin D. Roosevelt was president should be stretched to govern the 21st century Internet. AT#38;T Double surprise! AT...lso doesn't like the rules. The company's Jim Cicconi got a little wispy in his response[8]:Perhaps I'm betraying my years, but in Washington policy circles there has always been tension between those interested in solving problems and those who see policy disputes as a test of ideology. I'd readily admit falling into the former camp, and have the policy scars to prove it.Words words words. This part's just silly, though:Does anyone really think Washington needs yet another partisan fight? Particularly a fight around the Internet, one of the greatest engines of economic growth, investment, and innovation in history?Actually, yes, we should fight for the future of the internet. And yes, we should do it in Washington. Rep. Ted Cruz Ted's at it again[9]. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the Tea Party politician recited his anti-Obama speech:Washington wants Obamacare. The people want liberty. Washington wants amnesty. The people want rule of law. Washington wants power over the internet. The people want freedom online. And don't believe President Obama when he says, 'If you like your internet, you can keep your internet'!By the way this guy is one of the top recipients of campaign donations [10]from big cable companies. He's also now in charge of NASA[11]. Rep. Darrell Issa Here's another guy with misguided ideas who's in a frighteningly powerful position. Darrell Issa is the chairman of the House the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet. The Republican thinks that the FCC's new net neutrality rules will ruin the internet. Which is funny because big tech companies like Apple and Google support net neutrality. Issa said in a statement:Competition in private industry drives prices down. Government regulation ensures a lack of innovation. Hmm, I dunno, seems like my internet bills have been going up, but I can't switch to a cheaper provider because I only have one choice. Seems like we could innovate on that situation a bit. Random Think Tank Guy And then there's Berin Szoka, the president of an all-male think tank called TechFreedom[12], who swoops in with the punchline:Maybe it's finally time to start dismantling the FCC?Just burn it all down.

Cyrus Taraporevala believes that the growth expectations of the Chinese investment fund sector, along with the potential of Chinese companies to buy Western managers, will bring about a tremendous change in the landscape.</p><p><br/>\"In my opinion, China's entry into global capital markets and the rise of Chinese asset management giants will be the biggest change in the history of the sector,\" he says. \"The timing and conditions favor China,\" he adds. The executive notes that assets under management in China have increased four-fold since 2013, to $1.7 trillion, and are growing at an annual rate of 17%.<br/>This gives scope to huge growth potential, as only 8% of personal financial assets went to funds and the country's regulators try to reposition the capital to move from shadow banking to investment funds.<br/>China has emerged as a key market for foreign asset managers trying to grow globally and capitalise on demographic changes in the world's most populous country.<br/>Taraporevala, who since November 2017 leads the world's third-largest asset investment group, says that digital changes also pose a threat to traditional fund managers. \"I would not underestimate the ability of Chinese fintechs to overtake their Western competitors,\" he says.<br/>\"Companies such as Ant Financial and Tencent intend to move from money market assets and deposits to asset management. Just remember how Ant Financiall's money market fund became the world's largest fund in four years.\"<br/>Landing<br/>SSGA received authorization from the Chinese regulator in December to create an investment manager with only foreign capital. Since then he has hired Alex Sun, of HSBC's Jintrust fund manager, to the new position of China Chief Manager and Charles Zhao, of Janus Henderson, as head of institutions within the country.<br/>Jennifer Johnson, chief operating officer of Franklin Templeton, who manages $690 billion, believes the Asian giant's economy will have far surpassed that of the US in a decade. \"I don't know if the biggest asset manager will be Chinese by then, but it will certainly be one that has studied how to do business in China,\" he admits. \"It is clear that you cannot be a great asset manager without a presence in China,\" she adds.
