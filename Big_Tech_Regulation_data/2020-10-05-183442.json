A  lot going on, as always. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new investigation of Google uncovers how employees of the sinister tech  monopoly once again discussed ways to censor your political views without  your knowledge. Nobody in Congress seems to think this as a problem. These  new details might change their minds, fingers crossed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, yesterday, we told you how Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer has made  the banned list for bullying, and other imaginary moral crimes. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, the Victorians have another target, the salacious Christmas song,  Baby, It's Cold Outside. It turns out some of the lyrics in that tune are  naughty, and you should not be allowed to hear them. The Liberal Sherpa  joins us later to explain why.</p><p>But first tonight, it's been 752 days since the 2016 election. And for what  seems like the 752nd day in a row, the lead story in every news outlet in  this country is Russia. </p><p>Yes, Russia, a remote country in Central Asia with a median life expectancy  lower than that of Honduras. A place with an economy about the size of that  of the State of Texas, a vodka-soaked icescape (ph), whose shuffling  workforce can't seem to build a reliable airplane, that's Russia.</p><p>But nevertheless, it's a place that somehow, against all odds, manages to  dictate election outcomes on the other side of the world, using a crack  team of Secret Agents, so stealthy, we still don't know their names after  more than two years of investigating it. Russia.</p><p>According to cable news, Russia is the most important country in the world.  Today's installment of the Russia saga has something to do with Michael  Cohen and a potential real estate deal in Moscow. Now, the deal never  actually happened, not that would have made any difference, had it  happened. Foreign investment is still legal, even in Russia, but whatever.</p><p>This is a huge, huge deal, the hugest deal. It changes everything forever.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RON INSANA, SENIOR ANALYST &amp; COMMENTATOR, CNBC: This President may not  serve out his term that -- that Bob Mueller may have enough that there's  both intense legal and intense political jeopardy for the President of the  United States.</p><p>JEFFREY ROSS TOOBIN, LEGAL ANALYST, CNN AND THE NEW YORKER: You know,  today's the first day I actually thought Donald Trump might not finish his  term in office.</p><p>ANDERSON HAYS COOPER, AUTHOR, PRIMARY ANCHOR, ANDERSON COOPER 360 , CNN:  Really?</p><p>TOOBIN: I mean I think this thing is enormous.</p><p>JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: Today is a good day for Donald Trump to  resign. I really believe that.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: This thing is enormous. He's resigning. So, once again, the  Administration is doomed because of Russia. We'll see.</p><p>What's remarkable though is that for the past couple of years, as the  geniuses on cable television has -- have been sounding the relentless alarm  about our mortal foe, Vladimir Putin, an actual threat to America has been  rising in the East.</p><p>If you're looking for a country to fret about, forget about Russia. The  Russians may pose a threat to Montenegro and Ukraine, but Phoenix and  Buffalo remain safe. The real danger to this country is China, and  everybody in power knows that.</p><p>The FBI Director, Christopher Wray, describes China as by far the biggest  espionage threat we face. Federal officials estimate there are thousands of  Chinese nationals in America right now, acting as spies, working to steal  sensitive U.S. technologies.</p><p>Some of these work for the Chinese military, which, by the way, is growing  at a much faster rate than our military or, for that matter, Russia's.  Meanwhile, China is literally poisoning the American population. </p><p>Synthetic opioids are the main driver of the drug epidemic that has killed  more than 70,000 Americans in just the last year. China is the biggest  source of these drugs. The Chinese government has done virtually nothing to  stop the flow of them. Why would they? This is war, and they're winning.</p><p>Now, you might think our media would have noticed all of this and maybe  written a story or two about it. But, no. Many of them, it turns out, are  on the Chinese payroll too. </p><p>Vox.com recently published a nauseatingly sycophantic piece written by a  reporter who had just traveled to China, it turns out, on the Chinese  government's dime. </p><p>Over at Jeff Bezos' Washington Post, you'll periodically see an entire  insert called China Watch. It looks like a news section. It reads like the  rest of the paper. </p><p>In fact, it's literally a product of Chinese state media. They paid to  place it, just as they paid and influenced numerous think tanks around  Washington, as well as many colleges and universities throughout the  country. It's a huge propaganda push that is almost never noted by anybody,  and it costs a lot. But over time, it's worth it. </p><p>The Chinese get what they pay for, a compliant American establishment that  uses fake threats, manufactured threats from Russia to obscure real and  imminent threats from China. Turns out, there really are traitors in  Washington, but they're not working for the Kremlin.</p><p>Julian Epstein is a former Chief Counsel for Democrats on the House  Judiciary Committee, and he joins us tonight. So, Julian, you and I both  live in Washington, and we know personally a lot of people who are in  effect on the Chinese payroll.</p><p>Madeleine Albright has made a lot of money from China. John Boehner, the  former Republican Speaker, works for a firm that lobbies for China. Jim  Wolfensohn, who ran the World Bank, advises the Chinese Sovereign Wealth  Fund, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p><p>How many people do you know who are openly working for Russia in  Washington?</p><p>JULIAN EPSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER CHIEF DEMOCRATIC COUNSEL TO  HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: I think your basic point that the Chinese are a  greater long-term threat to us than Russia is, I think, that's true. I  think in the 1970s, China had about 1 percent of the flows of world trade.  They now have about 25 percent.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: They have about 2 percent of the global economy. And within the  decade, they will be equal to the size of the U.S. economy. By 2050, they  will be twice the size of the U.S. economy. </p><p>I think we thought, when we brought them into the World Trade Organization  in -- in 2001, that it would help them play fair. And I think what we've  seen since then is that they've cheated. They've stolen intellectual  property. </p><p>Up until 2014, they were certainly manipulating the currency. I don't think  they play by the rules. And I think one of the things I agree with the  President on is to get tough with China. I would approach it differently  than he does. But I think he's right to get tough on China.</p><p>I think the media ought to focus more on it. It's not as sensational, so  it's not going to get good ratings on cable television, but it's a real  problem. The disappearing middle class and working class is a real problem. </p><p>It's not sensational. It's not going to be a sugar-high for cable  television, so you -- I don't think you're going to have any of the  networks, not this network, not CNN, not MSNBC, any of them focusing on  those issues because you just don't get the sugar-high from that.</p><p>That's not to say Russia isn't a threat. I mean Russia has done lots of  things. All of our intelligence agencies and Republican and Democratic  Administrations have agreed--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --that even though they're 1 percent in the world economy, they  still do lots of things that are directly oppositional to us, and that are  trying to destabilize our interests--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --whether it's in the Middle East, whether it's in Syria,  whether it's in the Balkans, whether it's in the U.K. It doesn't mean that  they're not a real threat, and there's not something to take seriously. </p><p>But I think your basic point is correct, which is that we are sleeping  while Rome burns with respect to China, and we have not taken seriously the  fact that they don't play by the rules. We have, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, so I'm -- I'm waiting to jump in with a hostile question,  but you're making my case for me. You've taken--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: I -- well I -- I agree--</p><p>CARLSON: --all of my questions and reformatted them into--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --I agree with--</p><p>CARLSON: --statements because I think you're absolutely right. So -- so, I  guess--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --I agree with the metathesis. I agree with--</p><p>CARLSON: --well OK. Because I think--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --the metathesis.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's hard to -- and thank you for being honest about that. And I  -- by the way, it's not a partisan thing. There are a ton of Republicans  working on behalf of China, I'm embarrassed to say.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: And Democrats are finally waking up, I think, that there is a  real threat that China does not play by the rules, and that it's something  to take very seriously. Again--</p><p>CARLSON: So, so, so but I wonder though--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --I would approach it differently than the President. But--</p><p>CARLSON: --but--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --I think he's right to say this is a real problem.</p><p>CARLSON: --but there's all this moral outrage about Russia and Saudi  Arabia, neither of which I've ever been in favor of, by the way. I'm not  carrying water for either one. But the idea that a country we are allied  with assassinates one of its political opponents, yes, it's bad. </p><p>But, I mean, that is a practically (ph) daily occurrence in China, and no  one says anything about it. And I just wonder, should we treat the people  in Washington, who have a lot of power, who are getting rich from China,  should we treat them as traitors in the same way that we treat anyone who  deals with Russia as a traitor?</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: I -- look, I think your point about even-handedness is well- taken. I think the Chinese do horrible things to journalists and to  dissidents and they -- and they get a pass on it. </p><p>I think, in a lot of cases, the social media giants, Facebook and Google,  enable a lot of the bad behavior that's going on in a lot of autocratic  regimes. We don't hear that much about it although that's starting to get  covered.</p><p>I think if your point is proportionality, it -- does the news, and  particularly cable news, does it cover these things in the proper  proportionality? I agree with that meta-point that you're making. </p><p>It doesn't mean to say that when the Saudis go and kill an American  journalist, we shouldn't be getting tough on the Saudis. It doesn't mean to  say if the Russians create a military intelligence attack on the United  States that that's not something we shouldn't--</p><p>CARLSON: No, and I'm not arguing that.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --take seriously and we shouldn't -- and we should get to the  bottom of that. But I think your basic point is that, you know, there is  selective outrage. There is a lot of chest-thumping. </p><p>There is a lot of kind of, you know, morally superior indignation that --  that occurs on the Russia issue. And, you know, I -- you and I may have  slightly different views on the Russian issue--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm trying to argue with you, Julian Epstein--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --but--</p><p>CARLSON: --but it's -- it's proving absolutely impossible.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --but -- but--</p><p>CARLSON: You did a better job than I could have--</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --but, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: --in making that case.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --there -- there's lot of self-righteousness--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, tell me about it.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --on certain issues. And I -- I think there's reason to be  upset about what happened with Russia. There's reason to be upset with  Saudi Arabia. But I think if you're going to be outraged on those issues,  your point is correct that you should be equally outraged--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --on the abuses--</p><p>CARLSON: All right (ph). And -- and that's it-- </p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --that are occurring--</p><p>CARLSON: --right there.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: --in China. And the accusers (ph) in -- in China are very, very  serious, and you're exactly right about that.</p><p>CARLSON: Julian Epstein, thank you very much.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: OK. Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Unexpected. Appreciate it.</p><p>J. EPSTEIN: Good to see you, Tucker. OK.</p><p>CARLSON: Gordon Chang has been thinking about these questions for a very  long time. He's the Author of The Coming Collapse of China, and he joins  us. So, Gordon, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p>Put this into perspective, if you would. To what extent, do you think, the  Chinese government influences American policy?</p><p>GORDON GUTHRIE CHANG, COLUMNIST, BLOGGER, TELEVISION PUNDIT, LAWYER, THE  COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA AUTHOR: Oh, certainly across the board. We saw it  during this midterm elections, the Chinese tried to influence outcomes. </p><p>And they did it with not only that famous Des Moines Register's four-page  insert. But they also summoned the heads of Wall Street firms to Beijing  for that September 16th meeting. You go on and on about the types of things  that they've been doing.</p><p>CARLSON: Let -- let me -- let me -- let me pause there for our viewers who  don't know what you're referring to. September 16th, they, as you put it,  summoned the Heads of Wall Street firms to Beijing to do what?</p><p>CHANG: To talk about the midterm elections, to talk about tariffs, to talk  about the trade relationship because Beijing was very, very concerned about  what the Trump Administration is doing to impose costs on China, because it  is causing problems in the Chinese economy, which is under stress.</p><p>So, they said, \"Look, we're holding this meeting. We want you there.\" And a  lot of people from Wall Street actually took the flight to Beijing.</p><p>CARLSON: American citizens--</p><p>CHANG: American citizens.</p><p>CARLSON: --summoned by the Communist Chinese government actually went?</p><p>CHANG: They actually went and they held that meeting. And, you know, this  shows the power of Beijing, and it shows that they were trying to change  the results in the election. </p><p>Now, I don't think that it would -- had any real effect. And the reason is,  as Julian and you have talked about, across the American political spectrum  right now, people are starting to understand the fundamental nature of the  challenge that China poses to us. </p><p>And it's certainly much greater challenge than Russia, because Russia  couldn't challenge the U.S., if it weren't for being backstopped by the  Chinese.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. So, I mean you've got to think of Russia as sort of a -- a  drunk troublemaker that can kind of, you know, make some prank calls. But  in the end, China's economy is about to become, as Julian just noted  correctly, larger than ours. So, like, why aren't we completely freaked out  about our future about this (ph)?</p><p>CHANG: Well we should be because the Chinese are taking hundreds of  billions of dollars of U.S. intellectual property each year by theft or by  force transfer. And -- and that is the lifeblood of our economy because we  have an innovation-based economy. </p><p>And if we can't commercialize our technology, we don't have an economy. We  end up just selling agricultural products to the world and maybe scrap  metal. </p><p>The point is though we need to have the technological giants that will  dominate the future of the world's economy. They should be American. And  China, by means which are certainly not fair, is trying to do that.</p><p>And one other thing, Tucker, you mentioned Fentanyl and opioid crisis. You  know, the Chinese government runs a police state. They know about these  Chinese gangs that are selling Fentanyl into the U.S.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CHANG: And so, those gangs couldn't operate unless they had Beijing's  approval. Now, officials on China are making money from it and, in other  cases, the Chinese officials are just standing back. But they purposely  want to see Americans die. And we can't forget that.</p><p>CARLSON: Tens of thousands of Americans do die every year because of  synthetic opioids manufactured in China. And yet, I can't remember the last  time I heard someone in our political class say that out loud. Why?</p><p>CHANG: Well I -- I think that is because there's -- there's a lot of  reasons. </p><p>Part of it is because a lot of people are actually getting money from  China. A number of reasons for other people is that they sort of believe  that we should be engaging the Chinese, you know, this is the Nixon policy  of trying to work with Beijing, so that it's not on the outside of the  international system.</p><p>And that sounds nice but it hasn't worked over four decades. We've tried  all sorts of things, and -- and it hasn't worked. We've tried negotiation,  engagement. We did all those things. And, unfortunately, the Chinese  behavior in the economy and in other things has just gotten worse.</p><p>CARLSON: Gordon Chang, thank you very much for that.</p><p>CHANG: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p>Well employees at Google just got caught, once again, plotting to suppress  political views they don't like. We have details on that, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>CARLSON: More evidence that the sinister tech monopoly, Google, is not on  the level, not at all what it claims to be. New leaked communications from  inside that company show that Google employees discussed suppressing  Conservative news websites in their search engine right after the 2016  election.</p><p>In one post from November 9th, 2016, a Google Engineer, called Scott Byer,  called The Daily Caller and Breitbart, \"opinion blogs,\" and said that  Google employees should reduce the visibility of both sites in search  results compared to, \"Legitimate news organizations.\" Other employees said  it was the company's job to provide more \"Context\" to rebut news outlets  they dislike.</p><p>Robert Epstein is a Senior Research Psychologist at the American Institute  for Behavioral Research and Technology, and one of the people who's paid  closest attention to the power that Google has. Mr. Epstein, thanks very  much for coming on tonight.</p><p>So, Google has said repeatedly that it does not manipulate search results.  And yet, this is not the first, not even close to the first piece of  evidence we have from within the company showing Google employees  discussing ways to manipulate search results. Can we be confident they're  not doing it?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, PROFESSOR, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: Not at  all. You know, Google is extremely good at keeping its secrets for almost  20 years. But, in the last few months, that has changed, and there have  been quite a number of leaks. </p><p>And we have seen a number of internal discussions there like the one that  you just described. And there's simply no question that they have very  strong political leanings. 95 percent of donations there go to Democrats. </p><p>I myself am not a Conservative. I actually--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: --I -- I -- I kind of lean toward Google's political views. But  it's -- it's frightening to me because of what I study day by day. It's  frightening to me that this company, with very strong political leanings,  has the power to shift millions of votes, to shift opinions on a massive  scale without people knowing that they're doing it and without being  accountable to the public.</p><p>CARLSON: How can you have a democracy under those circumstances where one  privately-held company has the power to manipulate people's behavior  without people knowing it?</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: Well that's what I'm saying. And that's exactly what's  happening here, and the situation gets even worse when -- when these huge  tech companies, the two largest being Google and Facebook, when they both  have the same political leanings.</p><p>So, you know, in that kind of scenario, we're talking about the ability to  shift in the midterm elections, I calculated, upwards of 12 million votes  with no one having any idea that they're doing this. This is not like fake  ads where -- which you can see.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: This is invisible manipulation. I -- I literally have to invent  new names for the techniques they're using because they've never existed  before.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Google assures us that they're not doing this because they're  good people, much better people than we are, for example. How can we know  if they're telling the truth? And should we believe them?</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: Oh well, they're -- they're sure they're good people. That's  part of the problem. They have a kind of Utopian thinking within the  company, not just among the employees but, you know, their top executives  think like Utopians.</p><p>So, there -- there -- believe me, they believe that they are doing good for  humanity, good for -- good for the United States by imposing their values,  their thinking on the rest of us. The problem is, as I say, that they can  do it in ways that have never existed before in human history.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I know that -- as you already said, you and I have different  political views, probably don't vote for the same people, so you're maybe  the person to ask. </p><p>How can the United States Congress sit back with evidence that democracy,  the core idea of democracy, is being challenged by this company, and not do  anything about it?</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: Well, the Democrats aren't going to do anything because these  companies help them, obviously. The Republicans don't like regulations. So,  we have a tough problem here in the U.S.</p><p>Now, the Europeans, on the other hand, you know, they -- they see these  companies as American, and so, there have been -- they've been much tougher  on them. </p><p>And I think we're going to see -- we're going to see some pretty drastic  actions taken against these companies by the EU in the next few years. And  that could change their ability to operate worldwide.</p><p>CARLSON: I never thought I'd be waiting for France and Germany to come to  our rescue but that's -- that's where we are, unfortunately. Mr. Epstein,  thank you very much. It was great, as always.</p><p>R. EPSTEIN: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Harmeet Dhillon is an attorney who has frequently, at cost to  herself, stood up to big tech, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for--</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS  ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE  FOR  CALIFORNIA: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --coming on tonight. </p><p>So, this, again, as I just heard (ph) Mr. Epstein, yet another example of  evidence from within this company, and there are other examples like it  from Facebook, that show that they're not on the level, that they're lying  to us, and that they could undermine the very basis of our democracy. </p><p>Let me ask you the same question. Why is Congress standing by in the face  of this evidence and doing nothing?</p><p>DHILLON: Let me add to that, why is the Department of Justice not opening  up anti-trust investigations?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, exactly.</p><p>DHILLON: Why is the Federal Trade Commission not investigating them for  their deceptive trade practices and failure to disclose their manipulation  of data and theft of data from Americans and others? </p><p>So, today itself, the European Union opened up a new, its fourth in the  last two years' investigation into Google for anti-trust issues for  manipulating search. Guess what? And so far, they've been fined $7.1  billion in Europe in the last 17 months, but zippo here in the United  States on the same issues.</p><p>And one of the reasons, Tucker, is that these companies, both of them are  very adept at spreading money around Capitol Hill, including through the  use of a former Republican Congresswoman, Susan Molinari, and those are  their lobbyists, and they're very effective.</p><p>That's why you see legislators backing off for the most part. But we are  talking about fascistic, you know, control of our data in a way that is  perceived as benevolent by -- certainly by Liberals and is not being  criticized at all by the Right. I think it's a very dangerous situation.</p><p>CARLSON: So, but what's the point? I mean, just as (ph) a macro question,  what's the point of having a government, of sending half your income every  year to Washington, if they won't protect you from the most basic and  obvious threat to our entire system, which is these companies? Why do we  have a government if they won't stand up to Google and Facebook?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, interestingly, I think we're going to see some action on the  part of these companies, against these companies, I should say, in the new  Congress because Liberals are concerned about the data theft much more so  than Conservatives are. </p><p>But we're still not going to see anything about this bias in terms of  viewpoint. In addition to what you've covered on your segment tonight so  far, obviously, there's suppression of -- of YouTube videos on an  ideological basis. </p><p>Google also discourages its advertisers from advertising on Conservative  platforms like Breitbart and others. Google's search engine has labeled the  California Republican Party as having Nazi ideology and Republican Women as  -- as being enablers. </p><p>It is the most despicable, defamatory work, and it is all protected by the  Communications Decency Act, which members of Congress certainly could edit  and change, but they don't. And so, I'm very disappointed in our  government, our Conservative government, frankly, and Washington on its  failure to act on these issues.</p><p>CARLSON: So, as you just pointed out, very quickly, these companies operate  in the way that they do very profitably because they have a special  exemption from the Congress, which could revoke that exemption because  they're not platforms. They're media companies. Of course, they're editing.</p><p>Can -- name just, if you would, since we're live now, three or four Members  of Congress who, you know, might lead the charge against this?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, actually I guess, I don't think any Members of Congress  currently have identified themselves as being hostile to this. But, you  know, Jim Jordan certainly seems to be somebody who's familiar with these  issues. Matt Gaetz is another. </p><p>I think these guys are sensitive to these issues. But -- and I don't think  they're beholden to big tech. You know, maybe they haven't been there long  enough to have that sink in yet.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: But -- but we have -- we have had Senators, Mike Lee, for example,  has looked at the anti-trust situation, and then backed off. I'd like to  see our Senate newly constituted with more votes take a hard look at this,  have some hearings, really put them on the spot.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: Sundar Pichai is going to be testifying in Congress next week. I  have suggested that definitely some hard questions need to be asked. And I  know that there are certainly -- there's an intention to ask some hard  questions next week so--</p><p>CARLSON: I hope that happens.</p><p>DHILLON: --we'll see what happens.</p><p>CARLSON: Hope they get moving. Harmeet Dhillon, you've been brave on this  question. We're -- we're grateful for it. Thank you.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a man who says he was trying to blow the whistle on the  Uranium One deal, remember that, says the FBI repaid him by raiding his  house. That story's after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, here's an interesting story you may not have seen. FBI  agents raided the home of a Uranium One whistleblower. That's according to  a new report by The Daily Caller News Foundation. </p><p>A man called Dennis Nathan Cain has turned over documents to the DoJ as  well as to the both House and Senate Intel committees. The documents  allegedly show that federal officials failed to investigate possible  criminal activity involving the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One  deal. </p><p>Now, Cain says, the FBI repaid him by sending 16 agents to raid his house  for six hours.</p><p>Dan Bongino is a former Secret Service Agent, NRATV contributor, and Author  of Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump. He joins us tonight.  Dan, thanks a lot for coming on. So, this is a remarkable--</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  FORMER NYPD OFFICER, NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is one of those stories I personally don't want to believe  could be true that we live in a country where the FBI is used to carry out  political grudges. How do you assess this?</p><p>BONGINO: Well, Tucker, I don't want to believe that, either. Having been a  former Federal Agent myself, this is deeply disturbing. But there's --  there's a -- there's -- is a bifurcated way to look at this right now. And  I'll just -- I'll just sum it up like this.  This is either really, really bad for the Clintons or really, really bad  for the FBI, meaning this. You don't typically raid a whistleblower's  house. The whole idea of being a whistleblower is you're providing  information voluntarily to assist law enforcement or the government. </p><p>Why you would raid the house is puzzling to a lot of people? Some people  believe that this could be really bad for the Clintons and be kind of a  tying up of the Clinton Foundation case that appears to be being  investigated by John Huber right now, the United States attorney.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BONGINO: On the other hand, Tucker, listen, the people involved in this  Uranium One case, the Rosatom and the 10x (ph) case are all people who are  knee-deep in the Spygate saga. That -- that's just a fact. That's not a  conspiracy theory. It's just true.</p><p>Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, was the prosecuting United  States Attorney on the precursor case to Uranium One, that disaster, Bob  Mueller was the FBI Director. </p><p>So, forgive me for not being willing to give everybody a pass on a  suspicious raid on a whistleblower's pass. It's just a matter of fact. I --  I guess I should say it this way. I'm not taking anybody at their word any  more, and neither should you, either. We should ask questions on this.</p><p>CARLSON: But what's so surprising is who's not asking questions about this.  So, for generations, the Left elevated the idea of whistleblowing to -- to  -- to a sanctified place. Whistleblowers were protected. They are protected  in law, and they're protected because Liberals wanted them protected. </p><p>And yet, I haven't heard anybody in the Left complain about the FBI raid on  this guy's house. Why is that?</p><p>BONGINO: Tucker, listen, the -- the -- the rage at -- at Donald Trump has - - has this -- you have brought this up on your show so many times, it can't  be highlighted enough. </p><p>The Left, which previously aligned with groups like the American Civil  Liberties Union that was actually interested, at one point, no more,  apparently, in defending civil liberties has--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BONGINO: --completely abandoned that now. They have now flipped the script  entirely to actually defending weaponized government.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>BONGINO: It is unbelievable the transformation we've seen. There's --  listen, it's not in dispute that there are serious abnormalities in the way  the Donald Trump investigation was conducted, the Trump team investigation,  and the way the Clinton investigation and the Uranium One investigations  were sidelined.</p><p>But nobody's even remotely curious on the Left about this. It's really  incredible, because, Tucker, as you know with government, some day it turns  on you too. Government--</p><p>CARLSON: It's exactly right.</p><p>BONGINO: --doesn't respect party. It's all about power.</p><p>CARLSON: It's unwise. Very unwise.</p><p>Dan Bongino, thank you, as always, have a great weekend.</p><p>BONGINO: Thanks, Tucker. You too.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, as you well know, dozens of U.S. cities have decided they're  not going to enforce federal immigration law because they don't feel like  it. And that's OK with the Left.</p><p>Now, one Police Chief is looking to apply the very same standard to gun  control laws. How much support is he going to get? He joins us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, Merry Christmas from General Motors. The car company just  announced plans to lay off 15,000 workers and shut down major factories in  the states of Michigan, Maryland, and Ohio.</p><p>Now, the cuts are coming despite the fact that General Motors has posted  nearly $3 billion in profit just last quarter. Workers at one soon-to-be- closed plant told The Wall Street Journal that they were quote, blindsided  by the decision. They didn't know it was coming.</p><p>One person who will not be struggling to pay for Christmas presents this  year is General Motors CEO, Mary Barra. She made nearly $22 million in the  last year. That makes her the industry's highest-paid CEO. Toyota's CEO, by  stark comparison, makes less than $4 million a year, even though he runs a  far more successful company. </p><p>Now, what has Mary Barra done to earn all that money? Well, as CEO, she's  laid off thousands of workers. She shut down plants and overseen the recall  of tens of millions of defective vehicles. </p><p>A few years ago, she was forced to testify to Congress about faulty  ignition switches that killed more than a hundred drivers. In modern  corporate America, that is considered a deeply successful record. Give that  woman a raise. Of course, if GM is serious about cutting cost, there is one  obvious solution, fire Mary Barra.</p><p>Well, for years, Liberal cities and states have been claiming the right to  ignore federal immigration law. Now, one small town Police Chief in  Washington State is saying the same principle can be applied to far- reaching gun laws.</p><p>A new gun control ordinance in Washington imposes stricter background  checks, raises the age for buying a semi-automatic rifle, and allows gun  owners to be criminally prosecuted if their firearms are stolen, and then  used illegally.</p><p>Loren Culp is the Police Chief of Republic, Washington, and says that he  wants his town to be a sanctuary from these new gun laws. Some local  residents oppose the new measure in Washington. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Opponents say it forces gun owners to secure them in a  way that could put them in danger.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm concerned that not being able to access my gun  when I need it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're not going to tell the criminal, can you hold on a  moment because we have a law that I have to, you know, safe -- safely store  it in the garage somewhere and, you know, in a -- and so, can you hold on a  moment. I'm going to go take it. And I'm going to defend myself. Then,  we'll talk.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You call the police or -- or things go down, it's less  than one minute, so those seconds count.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Police Chief Loren Culp joins us tonight by Skype. Chief, thanks  very much for coming on. It's good to see you.</p><p>LOREN CULP, REPUBLIC, WASHINGTON, POLICE CHIEF: Good evening, Tucker,  thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is this, in effect, a -- a sanctuary, your town, Republic,  Washington, from the gun laws of your state?</p><p>CULP: I have suggested an ordinance and recommended it to the City Council.  And they're in the process of reviewing that, and doing their due  diligence, to see if they want to pass that. But as far as the Police  Department goes, we will not be enforcing that.</p><p>CARLSON: So, cities that have decided to ignore federal -- federal  immigration law have received the applause and support of almost everyone  on the American Left. What do you think the response will be if your town  passes this ordinance?</p><p>CULP: I don't think the same people would be very happy. The thing about it  is illegal immigrants aren't covered by the Bill of Rights in the  Constitution, and gun owners are.</p><p>CARLSON: A very good point. So what do -- what will happen next, do you  think? Will the Governor of the State try and force you to enforce the law  that you think is unconstitutional?</p><p>CULP: Well, I don't know how it could, Tucker, because we live in a  Constitutional Republic, contrary to what a lot of people tell us that we  live in a democracy. But we have the rule of law in this state and across  the United States. And the Constitution is the law of the land. </p><p>And everybody knows what the Second Amendment says. A lot of your viewers  might not know what the Washington State Constitution says about firearms.  But really quickly, it says the right of the individual citizen to bear  arms in defense of himself or the State shall not be impaired. </p><p>So, that's even more explicit than the Second Amendment. So, I -- I don't  know how they can get around that and try to force me to go against my Oath  of Office to uphold that.</p><p>CARLSON: Interesting. I had no idea your state's Constitution said that.  It's -- it sounds like it's being already ignored throughout the State of  Washington. So, very quickly, this State law would require gun owners to  keep their guns locked up at all times?</p><p>CULP: It requires you to keep it locked up because if someone gains access  to your gun, say, you're -- you're away from home and someone breaks into  your home and steals your gun, goes out and commits a crime with it, you  can be charged up to a felony for that person getting your gun and  committing a crime with it.</p><p>CARLSON: If someone--</p><p>CULP: Absolutely ridiculous.</p><p>CARLSON: --if someone steals--</p><p>CULP: It's like charging--</p><p>CARLSON: --your car--</p><p>CULP: --charging someone who has her car stolen and the person drives off  and goes through a crowd of people.</p><p>CARLSON: Huh.</p><p>CULP: It -- it's ridiculous.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that is ridiculous. And good for you for fighting back  against it. Chief Culp, thank you very much for coming on and explaining  that. Appreciate it.</p><p>CULP: Tucker, I have a real quick message for you, though.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>CULP: Ted Nugent (ph) told me to tell you hi.</p><p>CARLSON: Always a welcome message especially on a Friday. Thank you. Thank  you, Chief. Good to see you.</p><p>CULP: Good night, thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, there's no war on Christmas. That's like some Right-wing  trope that only dumb people believe. Meanwhile, the war on Christmas  continues apace. Yesterday, it was Rudolph. Today, it's something else and  we'll tell you what it is. Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: THE LIBERAL SHERPA.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the forces of darkness rung in the holiday season with an  attack on Rudolph, the Red-Nose Reindeer. That was at HuffPo. But those  attacks have expanded to a more familiar line of attack, the classic  holiday song, Baby, It's Cold Outside. </p><p>Cleveland Radio Station, WDOK, has dropped that song from its Christmas  lineup after a listener called in to complain that it was inappropriate,  somehow, in the wake of the #MeToo movement. </p><p>How about fat-shaming songs about Santa Claus? Will be -- they be the next  to go? Here to explain it, The Liberal Sherpa, Catalina Magazine Founder,  Cathy Areu.</p><p>Cathy Areu, great to see you tonight.</p><p>CATHERINE AREU, FOUNDING PUBLISHER, CATALINA MAGAZINE: Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: It does seem like a lot of the songs about Santa make reference to  his weight in a way that is not very sensitive.</p><p>AREU: I don't think he minds. I mean, he's jolly, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>AREU: He's a jolly guy.</p><p>CARLSON: Baby, It's Cold Outside. Is that song (ph)--</p><p>AREU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --we need to give up because of #MeToo?</p><p>AREU: Not because of #MeToo. I -- I looked at it and it seems like a few  years back, people were commenting that the lyrics--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>AREU: --if you read those lyrics, it's not a holiday song.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>AREU: It doesn't say holidays, happy holidays, Christmas, anything. It's  just cold outside. And an older man is telling a younger woman not to go  home to her parents, to stay around, have another drink. And she says,  \"What's in this drink?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>AREU: He says, \"Don't worry about it.\" She said, \"I feel kind of funny.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>AREU: \"Let's stick around.\" So, if you read it--</p><p>CARLSON: She's getting roofied.</p><p>AREU: --yes, apparently, he slipped something in the drink, and she stays  the night.</p><p>CARLSON: Do we get to a point where human worth, warmth, and romance, are  illegal?</p><p>AREU: That's not romance. This is a guy slipping her something and she's  spending the night, and she doesn't know what happened.</p><p>CARLSON: And yet, for 50 years, she never complained about it. I guess she  never knew how perfect (ph) she was.</p><p>AREU: She did. She said, \"I'm trying to say no, no, no.\" The song explains  it. She's saying, \"No,\" in the song.</p><p>CARLSON: When--</p><p>AREU: No means no, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --when Mommy kisses Santa Claus--</p><p>AREU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --has consent been given?</p><p>AREU: When Mommy kisses Santa? I -- I -- it sounds like Mommy was OK with  that. She didn't--</p><p>CARLSON: Really? This fat guy--</p><p>AREU: --say no, no, no.</p><p>CARLSON: --comes down your chimney, shows up in your living room and kisses  Mommy, and that's voluntary, you're saying.</p><p>AREU: I mean the cheek. Wasn't it on the--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, no, I don't -- I don't. But -- no, I don't--</p><p>AREU: --cheek.</p><p>CARLSON: --think so.</p><p>AREU: Oh, OK, because it's not--</p><p>CARLSON: Would Frosty, the Snowperson--</p><p>AREU: --specified there (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --be a more inclusive title, do you think?</p><p>AREU: I think so, yes. Man, you know, that's--</p><p>CARLSON: Does the phrase White Christmas--</p><p>AREU: --inappropriate, I mean. </p><p>CARLSON: --strike you as racist?</p><p>AREU: Snow is white, so it's appropriate.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>AREU: Yellow snow--</p><p>CARLSON: It doesn't seem problematic in the slightest?</p><p>AREU: I don't think so. I mean--</p><p>CARLSON: When White people sing Feliz Navidad, is that cultural  appropriation?</p><p>AREU: It depends, right? If they sing it with a sombrero, and they're  mocking at the culture then, perhaps, yes--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>AREU: --they've crossed the line.</p><p>CARLSON: But if they sing it just humming along--</p><p>AREU: And appreciating it. And appreciating the song--</p><p>CARLSON: --the sound track at Walmart, that's OK?</p><p>AREU: --if they appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: In what sense would they appreciate it?</p><p>AREU: Well, if they truly appreciate the language and the culture and  understand Feliz Navidad is Merry Christmas, yes, that's fine.</p><p>CARLSON: So, if they only know two words of Spanish, Feliz and Navidad--</p><p>AREU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's enough not to be a cultural appropriator?</p><p>AREU: Right, right, yes. Appropriation, it -- it's a fine line. Look, but  (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Rudolph, I got to ask you the last question, and this is dead  serious.</p><p>AREU: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that Rudolph, the Red-Nose Reindeer is a victim of  bullying?</p><p>AREU: Yes. That's the whole tale. He is a victim of bullying.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>AREU: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is it -- would you say so corrosive because Rudolph accepts  his bullying, he doesn't fight back--</p><p>AREU: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --that you would keep it from your kids?</p><p>AREU: You would have to talk it over and explain it with the kids. The kids  nowadays understand anti-bullying much more than kids when that was first  created.</p><p>CARLSON: But when it comes on, do you sit your kids down and say, look,  Rudolph's about to be bullied.</p><p>AREU: A responsible parent--</p><p>CARLSON: He seems complicit in his own--</p><p>AREU: --would.</p><p>CARLSON: --but right is but (ph) right. There's a little--</p><p>AREU: A responsible parent would.</p><p>CARLSON: --Stockholm syndrome, going on now. He doesn't even know he's  bullied.</p><p>AREU: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: He's leading the sleigh anyway.</p><p>AREU: As, yes, as you -- as you would. You would sit down with the child to  explain any bullying story. So, yes, Rudolph now needs an explanation.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that detracts them from (ph) the childlike joy of  Christmas when you explain--</p><p>AREU: Absolutely not. No--</p><p>CARLSON: --to your kids that Rudolph--</p><p>AREU: --it's a little scary, I think, for this generation to see that  Rudolph is being bullied. So, with this 2018 generation, you would have to  explain why he's being bullied for having a red nose.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it a little weird that the generation that's afraid of  everything and so easily intimidated spend so much time playing war video  games, and looking at pornography? I mean on -- so, on the one hand they  seem very kind of hardened--</p><p>AREU: I would say--</p><p>CARLSON: --and the other hand, they seem incredibly sensitive.</p><p>AREU: --I -- I can't imagine that they're doing those things.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I think they might be.</p><p>AREU: I don't think so.</p><p>CARLSON: Cathy Areu, great to see you--</p><p>AREU: Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: --as always.</p><p>Allie Beth Stuckey is the host of a very popular podcast. She joins us  tonight to respond to all this. Does Christmas seem as fun as it used to?</p><p>ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR,  RELATABLE PODCAST HOST, CRTV: No, it doesn't. And I was just thinking as  you guys were talking, how in the world did I survive my childhood years  without my parents sitting me down and talking to me about Rudolph, the  Red-Nose Reindeer? </p><p>I don't know how any of us survived without all of these Liberal Sherpas  and these woke (ph) warriors telling us how we should be offended, and how  we're actually oppressed by Christmas movies, I just had no idea.</p><p>CARLSON: I wonder why the rest of us play along with this. We're kind of  complicit in the destruction of the culture that we grew up in, when we  take it seriously, just so in (ph) HuffPo, which is, obviously, a ludicrous  website.</p><p>But I wonder when they run a piece like this, if the rest of us pay any  attention at all, and I'm guilty of this as well, if we're not sort of  giving it weight and legitimacy. And, maybe, the best is just to totally  ignore it, and celebrate Christmas as we always have, and pretend that  these people, these deeply unhappy people, mad at their parents, don't  exist.</p><p>STUCKEY: I don't know. I think it's good to kind of shake them out of their  echo chambers a little bit and just to remind them that everything you're  saying is absolutely absurd. This has become kind of like a sardonic sport,  I think, on the Left.</p><p>It's almost a competition to see who can say the most absurd, the most  progressive thing about things that have otherwise been innocuous for --  for decades. So, I do think it's important that Conservatives at least  weigh in a little bit and say, \"OK, let's talk about this factually.\"</p><p>CARLSON: You don't think that that I mean that they're kind of trolling us  in the end? I mean they -- they're -- they're--</p><p>STUCKEY: Oh, I -- no, I know (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --trying. I mean I sometimes feel like maybe it's too easy to get  a rise out of me, and it's better just to laugh at them--</p><p>STUCKEY: No, I think--</p><p>CARLSON: --and say, you know, go back to your -- your sad dystopia in  Brooklyn and argue amongst yourselves--</p><p>STUCKEY: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --that I'm not participating in this.</p><p>STUCKEY: Yes. I see what you're saying, but I don't know. I don't know. I  think that we do need to weigh in on these conversations because if we let  them slide, they do -- they do slip into the mainstream. </p><p>I wish that they were trolling us. This is why it's so hard to parody the  Left. It's why it's so hard to have satire of the Left because of the  things they say sound like satire. And I do think that we need to call that  out for fear that this will become normal.</p><p>CARLSON: Huh? Do you think that 10 years from now, people will be free to  use the term, snowman?</p><p>STUCKEY: Oh, no. It's already snowperson. Haven't you heard? It's--</p><p>CARLSON: Is it? Really?</p><p>STUCKEY: --gingerbread person. Yes, gingerbread person. Come on, Tucker.  You're behind the woke (ph) times.</p><p>CARLSON: My Producer just said in my ear, snowfolk. Have you heard of this?</p><p>STUCKEY: Snowfolk, I can't even say that. Snowfolk. Snowfolk, I can't say  it. I'll have to--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STUCKEY: --work on that one.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not playing along. The mailman brings Christmas cards with  snowmen on them. That's the world that--</p><p>STUCKEY: Oh, man. You're going to get--</p><p>CARLSON: --I live in. And I'm not--</p><p>STUCKEY: --censored. You might get taken off air.</p><p>CARLSON: --changing. </p><p>Allie Beth Stuckey, great to see you tonight. Thank you very much.</p><p>STUCKEY: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, we've always had a place in our heart and in the lineup  of this show for the weird and unexplained, and nothing is changing  tonight.</p><p>We bring you news of a newly found skeleton that washed up from the sea  that raises the question, \"What is under the water?

For example, Unified incorrectly posits that the 'court [] concluded [] that Ericsson had violated its FRAND obligations.' However, the TCL decision actually determined that Ericsson had met its FRAND obligations with respect to its course of conduct. The decision states: 'Ericsson negotiated in good faith and its conduct during the course of negotiations did not violate its FRAND obligation.' </p><p>(p3[3]) The article also incorrectly claims that Ericsson agreed with TCL on the number of patents that were actually essential. However, as the TCL decision makes clear, 'Ericsson made numerous challenges to the process that produced these numbers []. Ericsson challenged the results of this process' (p30[4]) Ericsson challenged these numbers because TCL's 'experts' spent only 20 minutes per patent in their analysis, producing a vast over-counting of industry's essential patents to Ericsson's detriment. Indeed, this was the exact criticism that the UK court leveled on this type of exercise. Tellingly, a later study found the results of the 20-minute-per-patent review to be comparable to random guesswork.Rather than correcting for all of those obvious mistakes uncovered by courts and industry analysts, the article propagates them. If Unified Patents wants to rely on bad data, poor analysis, vacated court cases, and blatantly false misstatements to pitch its business, potential clients and businesses need to ask themselves if they can afford to trust what Unified is selling.Even more, egregiously, is the following statement from the Unified article:It does not require much imagination to connect this seeming unfairness [I Ericsson's licensing practices] with the investigation started in 2019 by China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) into Ericsson's licensing practices.SAMR, the successor of China's NDRC, SAIC, and MOFCOM agencies[5] is, in fact, investigating Ericsson[6]. As someone who has had the pleasure of being the guest of the thugs at the NDRC[7], ostensibly investigating my former employer's licensing practices[8], I know full well that China's Anti-monopoly law is a weapon to be used against foreigners[9]. Do not just take my word for it, the USTR[10] ('Many U.S. companies have cited selective enforcement of the Anti-monopoly Law against foreign companies seeking to do business in China as a major concern []. U.S. industry has expressed concern about insufficient predictability, fairness, and transparency in Anti-monopoly Law investigative processes'), the White Office[11] of Trade and Manufacturing Policy[12] ('China seeks to force foreign patent and technology holders to accept below-market royalty rates in licensing and other forms of below-market compensation for their technologies'), the US Chamber of Commerce[13] (The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been forthright in expressing our serious concerns regarding a range of Chinese government policies and practices that restrict access to its market, condition participation in the market on technology transfer, and broadly seek to undermine the value of intellectual property held by American companies. These are global concerns that have also been voiced by stakeholders from around the world over many years'), and many others agree.As if further proof of SAMR's ulterior motive as a weapon of Chinese industrial policy, SAMR is now conducting[14] one of the first, if the not the first, competition law authority investigation, at the behest of a Chinese PAE, Iwncomm, into whether a company (Apple) is an unwilling licensee for engaging in 'hold out' failing to take a license on Iwncomm's FRAND terms. To be clear, SAMR does have a powerful argument to make that Apple is indeed a long time manipulator of the FRAND regime and a classic unwilling licensee - as the opening slides in Qualcomm's FRAND litigation with Apple demonstrate[15].Nevertheless, given one still must wonder why Unified would seemingly be carrying the water for China's antitrust authorities. Perhaps it has something to do with a major Unified backer's long history of giving aid to favored Chinese companies in their use of SAMR against SEP licensors[16].Indeed, after focusing on a reversed court decision, ignoring the two relevant court decisions, failing to grasp industry practice, and deceiving the reader with false statements, the article comes to the elevator pitch, describing Unified Consulting's services:'Using machine learning, Unified Patents has developed its Objective Patent Landscaping (OPAL) algorithm to identify essentiality based on sematic similarities [].'While an AI tool to perform essentiality and validity testing would be of great interest, any such tool is only as good as the algorithms and experts used to train it. To this end, one important prerequisite of any Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool is to be auditable (for more information, see here[17] or here[18] as examples of why AI audits are important). In other words, one needs to be able to determine whether a specific statistic or trait fed into an algorithm is being favored or disadvantaged at a statistically significant, systematic rate, leading to inaccurate results or adverse impacts on those underrepresented in the data set. Otherwise, the foundational rule of all computer science takes over and causes the entire project to be suspect:Garbage In, Garbage Out.[19]Based on the statements from Unified Patents in the article, it is hard not to wonder whether OPAL is a tool jury-rigged for LTE implementers, not for all LTE stakeholders. As such, it is reasonable to suspect that OPAL provides not only inaccurate results for being unfit for purpose but results that are inherently biased towards big tech and implementers. Such concerns will only be resolved when neutral third parties have audited OPAL. Until then two principles apply - caveat emptor (buyer beware) and cui bono (who benefits).Throughout its article, Unified Patents misleads its readers about the current state of the law on FRAND, and fails to offer well-rounded advice that can help customers navigate towards successful patent licensing outcomes. This lack of full candor makes it impossible to substantiate their claims. Could this qualify as unfair and deceptive advertising? Should consumer protection agencies discourage this type of false statement? Regardless, those who blindly follow Unified Patents' sloppy advice will undoubtedly face the consequences in court - up to triple damages for willful patent infringement, or injunctions. And then they'll understand the real scam.

Those protected were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents when they were children, and they now range from their teens to their early 30s.</p><p>In ending DACA, Trump sought to force Congress to deal with the issue but he also pledged on Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) to revisit DACA if need be.</p><p>The hue and cry regarding Trump and DACA shows not only large portions of the business community are taking more inclusive and progressive stances on immigration, but more big business brands and chambers of commerce are being vocal on issues that cut across cultural and political lines.</p><p> Protecting their workforce </p><p>Greg Sexton, a public relations executive with Santy, a Scottsdale-based communications firm, said many businesses see it in their best interests to be inclusive. That includes the intersection of immigration and finding skilled workers.</p><p>\"Many high-tech, manufacturing and industrial sectors rely on immigration as part of a productive workforce, so they're doing it to protect their livelihood,\" Sexton said. \"If we're not going to spend the money we need to improve education and produce world-class professionals, we need to bring in workers from outside our borders.\"</p><p>Peter Madrid, CEO of MadridMedia, a Phoenix-based public relations and marketing firm, said many big U.S. companies and brands are looking to reflect where they operate and appeal not only to a diverse but global marketplace.</p><p>\"We are a global society, and should conduct business accordingly,\" Madrid said.</p><p>Arizona's population is 31 percent Hispanic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and many big companies backing DACA and opposing Trump on immigration are in more diverse and politically liberal regions, such as California, New York and the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>\"Businesses should reflect the communities in which they exist. We are a nation of immigrants,\" Madrid said of some of the motivations behind business stances on DACA.</p><p> Hiring at someone's expense </p><p>Skeptics point out many technology companies opposing Trump on DACA and previous travel bans aimed at several Muslim majority countries are the biggest users of foreign worker visas. Critics of those programs say U.S. companies use them to hire fewer less-expensive and status beholding foreign workers.</p><p>Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Apple all rank among the most frequent users of foreign worker visa programs, according to MyVisaJobs.com.</p><p>Conservatives - including Trump and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions - also contend more open immigration policies backed by business interests result in more cheap immigrant labor, legal and undocumented, that pushes down wages and takes jobs from U.S. citizens.</p><p>Trump is looking to change some foreign worker visa programs to encourage employers to \"hire American.\" On DACA, Sessions and Trump argued its creation via an executive order from Obama stepped on congressional powers.</p><p>Madrid said employers see a broader worry in Trump's populist moves on immigration and attracting and keeping skilled workers.</p><p>\"We're educating a new generation of immigrants who are becoming engineers, doctors, scientists, and yes, journalists, at American colleges, then losing them to their native countries,\" Madrid said. \"We need to make staying in the U.S. more welcoming and appealing to them.\"</p><p> Support without a downside </p><p>Sexton said he really doesn't see a downside for companies speaking out on DACA. Part of that dynamic stems from the sympathetic nature of the DACA immigrants. That group, dubbed \"Dreamers,\" was brought into the U.S. at young ages, raised as Americans and many are students or working.</p><p>Barrett Marson, CEO of MarsonMedia, a Phoenix-based communications consulting firm, agreed.</p><p>\"They support the so-called Dreamers because, well, who could be against a dreamer? Isn't that the American Dream?\" Marson said.</p><p>Glenn Hamer, president and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, is a top ally of Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican liked by Trump. But Hamer has been a leading business critic of Trump's DACA decision.</p><p>Hamer said the potential deportation of DACA immigrants - including 30,000 in Arizona - will hurt the economy and impede Trump's bid for 3 percent GDP growth.</p><p>Marson said for big companies such as Google and Apple, it shows a worldwide and diverse customer base that they are inclusive and compassionate. That can be good for business as the U.S. becomes more diverse and global markets such as China and India become more important.</p><p>\"And we can't forget the struggle for the legal tender,\" Marson said. \"The people who lead corporations realize they need to sell as many of their products as possible.\"</p><p>Marson points out Corporate America and big tech companies previously were progressive advocates of same-sex marriage.</p><p>While business interests support Trump's proposed tax cuts and pullback on Obama administration regulations, they worry about his positions and rhetoric on trade and immigration. DACA offered a chance to challenge that.</p><p>\"He's shaking things up and making some folks nervous,\" Madrid said of Trump.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Those stories tonight on 60 MINUTES.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>THE REAL POWER OF GOOGLE</p><p>STEVE KROFT: This past week, the Federal Trade Commission was asked to  investigate the data collected by Google on its Android operating system,  which powers most of the world's smartphones. It was a tiny blip in the  news cycle but another sign of Washington's and Europe's growing concerns  about the enormous, largely unchecked power accumulated by tech giants like  Facebook, Amazon and Google over the last two decades. Of the three,  Google, which is part of a holding company called Alphabet, is the most  powerful, intriguing, and omnipresent in our lives. This is how it came to  be.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Most people love Google. It's changed our world,  insinuated itself in our lives, made itself indispensable. You probably  don't even have to type Google.com into your computer, it's often the  default setting, a competitive advantage Google paid billions of dollars  for. No worry. Google is worth more than three-quarters of a trillion  dollars right now and you don't get that big by accident. Since going  public in 2004, Google has acquired more than two hundred companies,  expanding its reach across the internet. It bought YouTube, the biggest  video platform. It bought Android, the operating system that runs eighty  percent of the world's smartphones. And it bought DoubleClick, which  distributes much of the world's digital advertising, all of this barely  raising an eyebrow with regulators in Washington.</p><p>Were any of those acquisitions questioned by the antitrust division of the  Justice Department?</p><p>GARY REBACK: Some were investigated, but only superficially. The government  just really isn't enforcing our antitrust laws. And that's what's happened.  None of these acquisitions have been challenged.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Gary Reback is one of the most prominent antitrust  lawyers in the country widely credited with persuading the Justice  Department to sue Microsoft back in the nineties, the last major antitrust  case against big tech. Now he is battling Google.</p><p>You think Google's a monopoly?</p><p>GARY REBACK: Oh, yes. Of course Google's a monopoly. In fact they're a  monopoly in several markets. They're a monopoly in search. They're a  monopoly in search advertising.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Those technologies are less than twenty-five years  old, and may seemed small compared to the industrial monopolies like  railroads and standard oil a century ago. But Reback says there's nothing  small about Google.</p><p>GARY REBACK: Google makes the internet work. The internet would not be  accessible to us without a search engine</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And they control it.</p><p>GARY REBACK: They control access to it. That's the important part. Google  is the gatekeeper for-- for the World Wide Web, for the internet as we know  it. It is every bit as important today as petroleum was when John D.  Rockefeller was monopolizing that.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Last year, Google conducted ninety percent of the  world's internet searches. When billions of people asked trillions of  questions, it was Google that provided the answers, using computer  algorithms known only to Google.</p><p>JONATHAN TAPLIN: They have this phrase they use \"competition is just a  click away.\" They have no competition. Bing, their competition, has two  percent of the market. They have ninety percent.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Jonathan Taplin is a digital media expert and  director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of  Southern California. He says Google's expertise may be technology, but its  business is advertising. And its most valuable commodity is highly- specialized information about us. It's helped Google control roughly sixty  percent of worldwide advertising revenue on the internet. Taplin says  traditional companies can't compete because they don't have the data.</p><p>JONATHAN TAPLIN: They know who you are, where you are, what you just  bought, what you might want to buy. And so if I'm an advertiser and I say I  want twenty-four-year-old women in Nashville, Tennessee who drive trucks  and drink bourbon, I can do that on Google.</p><p>GARY REBACK: People tell their search engines things they wouldn't even  tell their wives. I mean, it's a very powerful and yet very intimate  technology. And that gives the company that controls it a mind-boggling  degree of control over our entire society.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google is so dominant in search and search  advertising that analysts and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley say  it's extremely difficult for startups to get funding if their business  model requires them to compete with Google for ad revenue. Jeremy  Stoppelman co-founded Yelp more than a decade ago--a website that collects  local reviews on everything from auto mechanics to restaurants nationwide  and makes money selling ads.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: The initial promise of Google was to organize the  world's information. And ultimately that manifested itself in you expecting  that the top links, the things that it shows at the top of that page are  the best from around the web, the best that the world has to offer. And I  could tell you that is not the case. That is not the case anymore.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Instead of doing what's best for consumers,  Stoppelman says Google is doing what's best for Google.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: If I were starting out today, I would have no shot of  building Yelp. That opportunity has been closed off by Google and their  approach.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: In what way?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Because if you provide great content in one of these  categories that is lucrative to Google, and seen as potentially  threatening, they will snuff you out.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: What do you mean snuff you out?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: They will make you disappear. They will bury you.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Yelp and countless other sites depend on Google to  bring them web traffic--eyeballs for their advertisers. But now Stoppelman  says their biggest competitor in the most lucrative markets is Google. He  says it's collecting and bundling its own information on things like  shopping and travel and putting it at the very top of the search results,  regardless of whether it belongs there on merit.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: So let's start off with sushi--</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): He showed us how it worked by Googling sushi San  Francisco.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: All the prime real estate is here. This is where the  consumer, their eye focuses. And that's by design; Google wants you to pay  attention to their content.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): All of the information here is owned by Google  from the maps to the reviews. Stoppelman says if you click on any of these  links at the top of the page, you may think you've gone to another website  but in fact you will still be on Google, seeing what it wants you to see  while it collects your personal information and maybe exposes you to Google  advertising.</p><p>If you click anything inside this box, you stay on Google and they make  more money?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: That's right.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google told us it doesn't have anything to do with  money. It's about improving its product by making searches quicker and  easier for its customers by eliminating the need to click through lots of  other sites. Stoppelman says it's about stifling competition, pushing it  down the page where it's less likely to be seen. The advantage, he says, is  even more striking if you look at the search results on a smartphone.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: This is exactly what your phone would look like in the  palm of your hand. This is all of Google's own property, right here. It  takes up the entire screen.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: How important is that first page?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: It's not even just the first page. It's the first few  links on the page is the vast majority of where user attention goes, and  where the traffic flows.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: So if you're not at the top of the page or at the bottom of  the first page, or on the second page, that's going to affect your  business?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Yeah, if you're on the second page, forget it, you're  not a real business.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Yelp, Microsoft, Amazon, eBay, Expedia, and Yahoo  all complained about Google's dominance and what they called its anti- competitive behavior to the Federal Trade Commission, which in 2011  conducted an investigation.</p><p>According to a confidential memo--parts of which were inadvertently given  to the Wall Street Journal years later--the FTC's Bureau of Competition had  recommended that an antitrust lawsuit be filed against Google for some of  its business practices. It said \"Google is in the unique position of being  able to 'make or break any web-based business\" and \"has strengthened its  monopolies over search and search advertising through anti-competitive  means.\" and \".forestalled competitors and would-be competitors' ability to  challenge those monopolies.\" It specifically cited Google for stealing  competitors' content, and imposing restrictions on advertisers and other  websites that limited their ability to utilize other search engines. But  the recommendations were rejected.</p><p>GARY REBACK: It flatly says that Google's conduct was anti-competitive. It  flatly says that Google's conduct hurt consumers. I mean, what else would  you need to know to vote out a complaint? There it is, written by your own  staff. And yet, nothing happened.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: They closed the case?</p><p>GARY REBACK: They closed the case, correct.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): The FTC's commissioners decided that Google's  conduct could be addressed with voluntary improvements to some of its  business practices, and that Google's decision to move its own products to  the top of the search page could plausibly be of benefit to consumers. But  Reback and others who were directly involved in the investigation have long  suspected that the outcome had something to do with Google's political  muscle in Washington and its close relationship with the Obama  administration. Google spent more money on lobbying last year than any  other corporation, employing twenty-five different firms and helping fund  three hundred trade associations, think tanks and other groups many of  which influence policy.</p><p>GARY REBACK: They have a seat at the table in every discussion that-- that  implicates this issue at all. They know about developments that we never  even hear about. So their influence from my perspective is very, very  difficult to challenge. </p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Right now the only one taking aggressive action  against Google and the power of big tech is Margrethe Vestager, the  competition commissioner for the European Union. During her four years in  office, Vestager has become a thorn in the side of Silicon Valley, fining  Facebook a hundred and twenty-two million dollars for a merger violation  and ordering Ireland to recover fifteen billion dollars in taxes owed by  Apple. Last summer she levied a record 2.7 billion dollar fine against  Google for depriving certain competitors of a chance to compete with them.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Just as well as I admire some of the innovation by  Google over the last decade-- well, I want their illegal behavior to stop.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And that's what you feel has gone on.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Not only do we feel it, we-- we mean that we can prove  it. </p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): In researching the case, Vestager says her staff  went through 1.7 billion Google search queries and found that Google was  manipulating its secret search formulas--or algorithms--to promote its own  products and services and sending its competitors into oblivion.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: It's very difficult to find the rivals. Because on  average, you'd find them only on page four in your search results.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And why so far down?</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, because then you don't find them. I don't-- I  don't know anyone who goes to page four in their search result. The--  jokingly, you could say that this is where you should keep your secrets.  Because no one ever comes there.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: Do you think this has been deliberate on Google's part?</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Yes. We think that this is done on purpose.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: How do they do it? I mean, I think everybody has this idea  that Google has this algorithm, and they put the best searches right at the  top.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, it is exactly the algorithm that does it--both  the-- the promotion of Google themselves and the demotion of others.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: So, they're rigging the game.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Yes. And it is illegal.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google has paid its 2.7 billion fine and is  aggressively appealing the decision. But for now, Stoppelman says everyone  is still playing by Google's rules.</p><p>If you're in business, you have to be on Google.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Yeah. Google wields enormous power across the industry.  And they set the rules. The question is who's watching Google?</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>STEVE KROFT: Google declined our request for an interview with one of its  executives for this story. But in a written response to our questions, the  company denied it was a monopoly in search or search advertising, citing  many competitors including Amazon and Facebook. It says it does not make  changes to its algorithm to disadvantage competitors and that, quote, \"Our  responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not  specific placements for sites within our results. We understand that those  sites whose ranking falls will be unhappy and may complain publicly.\"</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>END    </p><p>[Copy: Content and programming Copyright MMXVIII CBS Broadcasting  Inc.

Those stories tonight on 60 MINUTES.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>THE REAL POWER OF GOOGLE</p><p>STEVE KROFT: This past week, the Federal Trade Commission was asked to investigate the data collected by Google on its Android operating system, which powers most of the world`s smartphones. It was a tiny blip in the news cycle but another sign of Washington`s and Europe`s growing concerns about the enormous, largely unchecked power accumulated by tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google over the last two decades. Of the three, Google, which is part of a holding company called Alphabet, is the most powerful, intriguing, and omnipresent in our lives. This is how it came to be.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Most people love Google. It`s changed our world, insinuated itself in our lives, made itself indispensable. You probably don`t even have to type Google.com into your computer, it`s often the default setting, a competitive advantage Google paid billions of dollars for. No worry. Google is worth more than three-quarters of a trillion dollars right now and you don`t get that big by accident. Since going public in 2004, Google has acquired more than two hundred companies, expanding its reach across the internet. It bought YouTube, the biggest video platform. It bought Android, the operating system that runs eighty percent of the world`s smartphones. And it bought DoubleClick, which distributes much of the world`s digital advertising, all of this barely raising an eyebrow with regulators in Washington.</p><p>Were any of those acquisitions questioned by the antitrust division of the Justice Department?</p><p>GARY REBACK: Some were investigated, but only superficially. The government just really isn`t enforcing our antitrust laws. And that`s what`s happened. None of these acquisitions have been challenged.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Gary Reback is one of the most prominent antitrust lawyers in the country widely credited with persuading the Justice Department to sue Microsoft back in the nineties, the last major antitrust case against big tech. Now he is battling Google.</p><p>You think Google`s a monopoly?</p><p>GARY REBACK: Oh, yes. Of course Google`s a monopoly. In fact they`re a monopoly in several markets. They`re a monopoly in search. They`re a monopoly in search advertising.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Those technologies are less than twenty-five years old, and may seemed small compared to the industrial monopolies like railroads and standard oil a century ago. But Reback says there`s nothing small about Google.</p><p>GARY REBACK: Google makes the internet work. The internet would not be accessible to us without a search engine</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And they control it.</p><p>GARY REBACK: They control access to it. That`s the important part. Google is the gatekeeper for-- for the World Wide Web, for the internet as we know it. It is every bit as important today as petroleum was when John D. Rockefeller was monopolizing that.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Last year, Google conducted ninety percent of the world`s internet searches. When billions of people asked trillions of questions, it was Google that provided the answers, using computer algorithms known only to Google.</p><p>JONATHAN TAPLIN: They have this phrase they use \"competition is just a click away.\" They have no competition. Bing, their competition, has two percent of the market. They have ninety percent.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Jonathan Taplin is a digital media expert and director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California. He says Google`s expertise may be technology, but its business is advertising. And its most valuable commodity is highly- specialized information about us. It`s helped Google control roughly sixty percent of worldwide advertising revenue on the internet. Taplin says traditional companies can`t compete because they don`t have the data.</p><p>JONATHAN TAPLIN: They know who you are, where you are, what you just bought, what you might want to buy. And so if I`m an advertiser and I say I want twenty-four-year-old women in Nashville, Tennessee who drive trucks and drink bourbon, I can do that on Google.</p><p>GARY REBACK: People tell their search engines things they wouldn`t even tell their wives. I mean, it`s a very powerful and yet very intimate technology. And that gives the company that controls it a mind-boggling degree of control over our entire society.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google is so dominant in search and search advertising that analysts and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley say it`s extremely difficult for startups to get funding if their business model requires them to compete with Google for ad revenue. Jeremy Stoppelman co-founded Yelp more than a decade ago--a website that collects local reviews on everything from auto mechanics to restaurants nationwide and makes money selling ads.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: The initial promise of Google was to organize the world`s information. And ultimately that manifested itself in you expecting that the top links, the things that it shows at the top of that page are the best from around the web, the best that the world has to offer. And I could tell you that is not the case. That is not the case anymore.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Instead of doing what`s best for consumers, Stoppelman says Google is doing what`s best for Google.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: If I were starting out today, I would have no shot of building Yelp. That opportunity has been closed off by Google and their approach.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: In what way?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Because if you provide great content in one of these categories that is lucrative to Google, and seen as potentially threatening, they will snuff you out.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: What do you mean snuff you out?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: They will make you disappear. They will bury you.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Yelp and countless other sites depend on Google to bring them web traffic--eyeballs for their advertisers. But now Stoppelman says their biggest competitor in the most lucrative markets is Google. He says it`s collecting and bundling its own information on things like shopping and travel and putting it at the very top of the search results, regardless of whether it belongs there on merit.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: So let`s start off with sushi--</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): He showed us how it worked by Googling sushi San Francisco.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: All the prime real estate is here. This is where the consumer, their eye focuses. And that`s by design; Google wants you to pay attention to their content.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): All of the information here is owned by Google from the maps to the reviews. Stoppelman says if you click on any of these links at the top of the page, you may think you`ve gone to another website but in fact you will still be on Google, seeing what it wants you to see while it collects your personal information and maybe exposes you to Google advertising.</p><p>If you click anything inside this box, you stay on Google and they make more money?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: That`s right.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google told us it doesn`t have anything to do with money. It`s about improving its product by making searches quicker and easier for its customers by eliminating the need to click through lots of other sites. Stoppelman says it`s about stifling competition, pushing it down the page where it`s less likely to be seen. The advantage, he says, is even more striking if you look at the search results on a smartphone.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: This is exactly what your phone would look like in the palm of your hand. This is all of Google`s own property, right here. It takes up the entire screen.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: How important is that first page?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: It`s not even just the first page. It`s the first few links on the page is the vast majority of where user attention goes, and where the traffic flows.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: So if you`re not at the top of the page or at the bottom of the first page, or on the second page, that`s going to affect your business?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Yeah, if you`re on the second page, forget it, you`re not a real business.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Yelp, Microsoft, Amazon, eBay, Expedia, and Yahoo all complained about Google`s dominance and what they called its anti- competitive behavior to the Federal Trade Commission, which in 2011 conducted an investigation.</p><p>According to a confidential memo--parts of which were inadvertently given to the Wall Street Journal years later--the FTC`s Bureau of Competition had recommended that an antitrust lawsuit be filed against Google for some of its business practices. It said \"Google is in the unique position of being able to `make or break any web-based business\" and \"has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anti-competitive means.\" and \".forestalled competitors and would-be competitors` ability to challenge those monopolies.\" It specifically cited Google for stealing competitors` content, and imposing restrictions on advertisers and other websites that limited their ability to utilize other search engines. But the recommendations were rejected.</p><p>GARY REBACK: It flatly says that Google`s conduct was anti-competitive. It flatly says that Google`s conduct hurt consumers. I mean, what else would you need to know to vote out a complaint? There it is, written by your own staff. And yet, nothing happened.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: They closed the case?</p><p>GARY REBACK: They closed the case, correct.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): The FTC`s commissioners decided that Google`s conduct could be addressed with voluntary improvements to some of its business practices, and that Google`s decision to move its own products to the top of the search page could plausibly be of benefit to consumers. But Reback and others who were directly involved in the investigation have long suspected that the outcome had something to do with Google`s political muscle in Washington and its close relationship with the Obama administration. Google spent more money on lobbying last year than any other corporation, employing twenty-five different firms and helping fund three hundred trade associations, think tanks and other groups many of which influence policy.</p><p>GARY REBACK: They have a seat at the table in every discussion that-- that implicates this issue at all. They know about developments that we never even hear about. So their influence from my perspective is very, very difficult to challenge.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Right now the only one taking aggressive action against Google and the power of big tech is Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner for the European Union. During her four years in office, Vestager has become a thorn in the side of Silicon Valley, fining Facebook a hundred and twenty-two million dollars for a merger violation and ordering Ireland to recover fifteen billion dollars in taxes owed by Apple. Last summer she levied a record 2.7 billion dollar fine against Google for depriving certain competitors of a chance to compete with them.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Just as well as I admire some of the innovation by Google over the last decade-- well, I want their illegal behavior to stop.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And that`s what you feel has gone on.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Not only do we feel it, we-- we mean that we can prove it.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): In researching the case, Vestager says her staff went through 1.7 billion Google search queries and found that Google was manipulating its secret search formulas--or algorithms--to promote its own products and services and sending its competitors into oblivion.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: It`s very difficult to find the rivals. Because on average, you`d find them only on page four in your search results.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And why so far down?</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, because then you don`t find them. I don`t-- I don`t know anyone who goes to page four in their search result. The-- jokingly, you could say that this is where you should keep your secrets. Because no one ever comes there.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: Do you think this has been deliberate on Google`s part?</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Yes. We think that this is done on purpose.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: How do they do it? I mean, I think everybody has this idea that Google has this algorithm, and they put the best searches right at the top.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, it is exactly the algorithm that does it--both the-- the promotion of Google themselves and the demotion of others.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: So, they`re rigging the game.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Yes. And it is illegal.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google has paid its 2.7 billion fine and is aggressively appealing the decision. But for now, Stoppelman says everyone is still playing by Google`s rules.</p><p>If you`re in business, you have to be on Google.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Yeah. Google wields enormous power across the industry. And they set the rules. The question is who`s watching Google?</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>STEVE KROFT: Google declined our request for an interview with one of its executives for this story. But in a written response to our questions, the company denied it was a monopoly in search or search advertising, citing many competitors including Amazon and Facebook.

His request comes amid a flurry of high-profile congressional hearings on the enormous, largely unchecked power accumulated by tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google over the last two decades. Of the three, Google, which is part of a holding company called Alphabet, is the most powerful, intriguing, and omnipresent in our lives. This is how it came to be.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Begin VT)</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Most people love Google. It`s changed our world, insinuated itself in our lives, made itself indispensable. You probably don`t even have to type Google.com into your computer, it`s often the default setting, a competitive advantage Google paid billions of dollars for. No worry. Google is worth more than three-quarters of a trillion dollars right now and you don`t get that big by accident. Since going public in 2004, Google has acquired more than two hundred companies, expanding its reach across the internet. It bought YouTube, the biggest video platform. It bought Android, the operating system that runs eighty percent of the world`s smartphones. And it bought DoubleClick, which distributes much of the world`s digital advertising, all of this barely raising an eyebrow with regulators in Washington.</p><p>Were any of those acquisitions questioned by the antitrust division of the Justice Department?</p><p>GARY REBACK: Some were investigated, but only superficially. The government just really isn`t enforcing our antitrust laws. And that`s what`s happened. None of these acquisitions have been challenged.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Gary Reback is one of the most prominent antitrust lawyers in the country widely credited with persuading the Justice Department to sue Microsoft back in the nineties, the last major antitrust case against big tech. Now he is battling Google.</p><p>You think Google`s a monopoly?</p><p>GARY REBACK: Oh, yes. Of course Google`s a monopoly. In fact they`re a monopoly in several markets. They`re a monopoly in search. They`re a monopoly in search advertising.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Those technologies are less than twenty-five years old, and may seemed small compared to the industrial monopolies like railroads and standard oil a century ago. But Reback says there`s nothing small about Google.</p><p>GARY REBACK: Google makes the internet work. The internet would not be accessible to us without a search engine</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And they control it.</p><p>GARY REBACK: They control access to it. That`s the important part. Google is the gatekeeper for-- for the World Wide Web, for the internet as we know it. It is every bit as important today as petroleum was when John D. Rockefeller was monopolizing that.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Last year, Google conducted ninety percent of the world`s internet searches. When billions of people asked trillions of questions, it was Google that provided the answers, using computer algorithms known only to Google.</p><p>JONATHAN TAPLIN: They have this phrase they use \"competition is just a click away.\" They have no competition. Bing, their competition, has two percent of the market. They have ninety percent.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Jonathan Taplin is a digital media expert and director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California. He says Google`s expertise may be technology, but its business is advertising. And its most valuable commodity is highly- specialized information about us. It`s helped Google control roughly sixty percent of worldwide advertising revenue on the internet. Taplin says traditional companies can`t compete because they don`t have the data.</p><p>JONATHAN TAPLIN: They know who you are, where you are, what you just bought, what you might want to buy. And so if I`m an advertiser and I say I want twenty-four-year-old women in Nashville, Tennessee, who drive trucks and drink bourbon, I can do that on Google.</p><p>GARY REBACK: People tell their search engines things they wouldn`t even tell their wives. I mean, it`s a very powerful and yet very intimate technology. And that gives the company that controls it a mind-boggling degree of control over our entire society.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google is so dominant in search and search advertising that analysts and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley say it`s extremely difficult for startups to get funding if their business model requires them to compete with Google for ad revenue. Jeremy Stoppelman co-founded Yelp more than a decade ago--a website that collects local reviews on everything from auto mechanics to restaurants nationwide and makes money selling ads.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: The initial promise of Google was to organize the world`s information. And ultimately that manifested itself in you expecting that the top links, the things that it shows at the top of that page are the best from around the web, the best that the world has to offer. And I could tell you that is not the case. That is not the case anymore.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Instead of doing what`s best for consumers, Stoppelman says Google is doing what`s best for Google.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: If I were starting out today, I would have no shot of building Yelp. That opportunity has been closed off by Google and their approach.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: In what way?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Because if you provide great content in one of these categories that is lucrative to Google, and seen as potentially threatening, they will snuff you out.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: What do you mean snuff you out?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: They will make you disappear. They will bury you.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Yelp and countless other sites depend on Google to bring them web traffic--eyeballs for their advertisers. But now Stoppelman says their biggest competitor in the most lucrative markets is Google. He says it`s collecting and bundling its own information on things like shopping and travel and putting it at the very top of the search results, regardless of whether it belongs there on merit.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: So let`s start off with sushi--</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): He showed us how it worked by Googling sushi San Francisco.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: All the prime real estate is here. This is where the consumer, their eye focuses. And that`s by design; Google wants you to pay attention to their content.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): All of the information here is owned by Google from the maps to the reviews. Stoppelman says if you click on any of these links at the top of the page, you may think you`ve gone to another website but in fact you will still be on Google, seeing what it wants you to see while it collects your personal information and maybe exposes you to Google advertising.</p><p>If you click anything inside this box, you stay on Google and they make more money?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: That`s right.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google told us it doesn`t have anything to do with money. It`s about improving its product by making searches quicker and easier for its customers by eliminating the need to click through lots of other sites. Stoppelman says it`s about stifling competition, pushing it down the page where it`s less likely to be seen. The advantage, he says, is even more striking if you look at the search results on a smartphone.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: This is exactly what your phone would look like in the palm of your hand. This is all of Google`s own property, right here. It takes up the entire screen.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: How important is that first page?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: It`s not even just the first page. It`s the first few links on the page is the vast majority of where user attention goes, and where the traffic flows.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: So if you`re not at the top of the page or at the bottom of the first page, or on the second page, that`s going to affect your business?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Yeah, if you`re on the second page, forget it, you`re not a real business.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Yelp, Microsoft, Amazon, eBay, Expedia, and Yahoo all complained about Google`s dominance and what they called its anti- competitive behavior to the Federal Trade Commission, which in 2011 conducted an investigation.</p><p>According to this confidential memo--parts of which were inadvertently given to the Wall Street Journal years later--the FTC`s Bureau of Competition had recommended that an antitrust lawsuit be filed against Google for some of its business practices. It said \"Google is in the unique position of being able to `make or break any web-based business\" and \"has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anti-competitive means.\" and \".forestalled competitors and would-be competitors` ability to challenge those monopolies...\" It specifically cited Google for stealing competitors` content, and imposing restrictions on advertisers and other websites that limited their ability to utilize other search engines. But the recommendations were rejected.</p><p>GARY REBACK: It flatly says that Google`s conduct was anti-competitive. It flatly says that Google`s conduct hurt consumers. I mean, what else would you need to know to vote out a complaint? There it is, written by your own staff. And yet, nothing happened.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: They closed the case?</p><p>GARY REBACK: They closed the case, correct.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): The FTC`s commissioners decided that Google`s conduct could be addressed with voluntary improvements to some of its business practices, and that Google`s decision to move its own products to the top of the search page could plausibly be of benefit to consumers. But Reback and others who were directly involved in the investigation have long suspected that the outcome had something to do with Google`s political muscle in Washington and its close relationship with the Obama administration. Google spent more money on lobbying last year than any other corporation, employing twenty-five different firms and helping fund three hundred trade associations, think tanks and other groups many of which influence policy.</p><p>GARY REBACK: They have a seat at the table in every discussion that-- that implicates this issue at all. They know about developments that we never even hear about. So their influence from my perspective is very, very difficult to challenge.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Until now the only one taking aggressive action against Google and big tech is Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner for the European Union. Vestager has become a thorn in the side of Silicon Valley, fining Facebook a hundred and twenty-two million dollars for a merger violation and ordering Ireland to recover fifteen billion dollars in taxes owed by Apple. Last year, she levied a 2.7- billion-dollar fine against Google for depriving certain competitors of a chance to compete with them.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Just as well as I admire some of the innovation by Google over the last decade-- well, I want their illegal behavior to stop.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And that`s what you feel has gone on.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Not only do we feel it, we-- we mean that we can prove it.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): In researching the case, Vestager says her staff went through 1.7 billion Google search queries and found that Google was manipulating its secret search formulas--or algorithms--to promote its own products and services and sending its competitors into oblivion.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: It`s very difficult to find the rivals. Because on average, you`d find them only on page four in your search results.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And why so far down?</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, because then you don`t find them. I don`t-- I don`t know anyone who goes to page four in their search result. The-- jokingly, you could say that this is where you should keep your secrets. Because no one ever comes there.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: Do you think this has been deliberate on Google`s part?</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Yes. We think that this is done on purpose.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: How do they do it? I mean, I think everybody has this idea that Google has this algorithm, and they put the best searches right at the top.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, it is exactly the algorithm that does it, both-- the promotion of Google themselves and the demotion of others.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: So, they`re rigging the game.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Yes. And it is illegal.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google has paid its 2.7-billion-dollar fine and is aggressively appealing the decision. But for now, Stoppelman says everyone is still playing by Google`s rules.</p><p>If you`re in business, you have to be on Google.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Yeah. Google wields enormous power across the industry. And they set the rules. The question is who`s watching Google?</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>STEVE KROFT: Since the story aired in May, the European Union has levied another record fine against Google, this one five billion dollars, for anti-competitive practices involving its Android mobile software. Google declined our request for an interview with one of its top executives. It has also declined to make them available to testify at hearings before Congress. In a written response to our questions the company denied it was a monopoly in search or search advertising, citing many competitors including Amazon and Facebook. It says it does not make changes to its algorithm to disadvantage competitors and that, quote, \"Our responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.

His request comes amid a flurry of high-profile  congressional hearings on the enormous, largely unchecked power accumulated  by tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google over the last two decades.  Of the three, Google, which is part of a holding company called Alphabet,  is the most powerful, intriguing, and omnipresent in our lives. This is how  it came to be.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Begin VT)</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Most people love Google. It's changed our world,  insinuated itself in our lives, made itself indispensable. You probably  don't even have to type Google.com into your computer, it's often the  default setting, a competitive advantage Google paid billions of dollars  for. No worry. Google is worth more than three-quarters of a trillion  dollars right now and you don't get that big by accident. Since going  public in 2004, Google has acquired more than two hundred companies,  expanding its reach across the internet. It bought YouTube, the biggest  video platform. It bought Android, the operating system that runs eighty  percent of the world's smartphones. And it bought DoubleClick, which  distributes much of the world's digital advertising, all of this barely  raising an eyebrow with regulators in Washington.</p><p>Were any of those acquisitions questioned by the antitrust division of the  Justice Department?</p><p>GARY REBACK: Some were investigated, but only superficially. The government  just really isn't enforcing our antitrust laws. And that's what's happened.  None of these acquisitions have been challenged.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Gary Reback is one of the most prominent antitrust  lawyers in the country widely credited with persuading the Justice  Department to sue Microsoft back in the nineties, the last major antitrust  case against big tech. Now he is battling Google.</p><p>You think Google's a monopoly?</p><p>GARY REBACK: Oh, yes. Of course Google's a monopoly. In fact they're a  monopoly in several markets. They're a monopoly in search. They're a  monopoly in search advertising.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Those technologies are less than twenty-five years  old, and may seemed small compared to the industrial monopolies like  railroads and standard oil a century ago. But Reback says there's nothing  small about Google.</p><p>GARY REBACK: Google makes the internet work. The internet would not be  accessible to us without a search engine</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And they control it.</p><p>GARY REBACK: They control access to it. That's the important part. Google  is the gatekeeper for-- for the World Wide Web, for the internet as we know  it. It is every bit as important today as petroleum was when John D.  Rockefeller was monopolizing that.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Last year, Google conducted ninety percent of the  world's internet searches. When billions of people asked trillions of  questions, it was Google that provided the answers, using computer  algorithms known only to Google.</p><p>JONATHAN TAPLIN: They have this phrase they use \"competition is just a  click away.\" They have no competition. Bing, their competition, has two  percent of the market. They have ninety percent.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Jonathan Taplin is a digital media expert and  director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of  Southern California. He says Google's expertise may be technology, but its  business is advertising. And its most valuable commodity is highly- specialized information about us. It's helped Google control roughly sixty  percent of worldwide advertising revenue on the internet. Taplin says  traditional companies can't compete because they don't have the data.</p><p>JONATHAN TAPLIN: They know who you are, where you are, what you just  bought, what you might want to buy. And so if I'm an advertiser and I say I  want twenty-four-year-old women in Nashville, Tennessee, who drive trucks  and drink bourbon, I can do that on Google.</p><p>GARY REBACK: People tell their search engines things they wouldn't even  tell their wives. I mean, it's a very powerful and yet very intimate  technology. And that gives the company that controls it a mind-boggling  degree of control over our entire society.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google is so dominant in search and search  advertising that analysts and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley say  it's extremely difficult for startups to get funding if their business  model requires them to compete with Google for ad revenue. Jeremy  Stoppelman co-founded Yelp more than a decade ago--a website that collects  local reviews on everything from auto mechanics to restaurants nationwide  and makes money selling ads.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: The initial promise of Google was to organize the  world's information. And ultimately that manifested itself in you expecting  that the top links, the things that it shows at the top of that page are  the best from around the web, the best that the world has to offer. And I  could tell you that is not the case. That is not the case anymore.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Instead of doing what's best for consumers,  Stoppelman says Google is doing what's best for Google.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: If I were starting out today, I would have no shot of  building Yelp. That opportunity has been closed off by Google and their  approach.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: In what way?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Because if you provide great content in one of these  categories that is lucrative to Google, and seen as potentially  threatening, they will snuff you out.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: What do you mean snuff you out?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: They will make you disappear. They will bury you.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Yelp and countless other sites depend on Google to  bring them web traffic--eyeballs for their advertisers. But now Stoppelman  says their biggest competitor in the most lucrative markets is Google. He  says it's collecting and bundling its own information on things like  shopping and travel and putting it at the very top of the search results,  regardless of whether it belongs there on merit.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: So let's start off with sushi--</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): He showed us how it worked by Googling sushi San  Francisco.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: All the prime real estate is here. This is where the  consumer, their eye focuses. And that's by design; Google wants you to pay  attention to their content.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): All of the information here is owned by Google  from the maps to the reviews. Stoppelman says if you click on any of these  links at the top of the page, you may think you've gone to another website  but in fact you will still be on Google, seeing what it wants you to see  while it collects your personal information and maybe exposes you to Google  advertising.</p><p>If you click anything inside this box, you stay on Google and they make  more money?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: That's right.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google told us it doesn't have anything to do with  money. It's about improving its product by making searches quicker and  easier for its customers by eliminating the need to click through lots of  other sites. Stoppelman says it's about stifling competition, pushing it  down the page where it's less likely to be seen. The advantage, he says, is  even more striking if you look at the search results on a smartphone.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: This is exactly what your phone would look like in the  palm of your hand. This is all of Google's own property, right here. It  takes up the entire screen.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: How important is that first page?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: It's not even just the first page. It's the first few  links on the page is the vast majority of where user attention goes, and  where the traffic flows.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: So if you're not at the top of the page or at the bottom of  the first page, or on the second page, that's going to affect your  business?</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Yeah, if you're on the second page, forget it, you're  not a real business.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Yelp, Microsoft, Amazon, eBay, Expedia, and Yahoo  all complained about Google's dominance and what they called its anti- competitive behavior to the Federal Trade Commission, which in 2011  conducted an investigation.</p><p>According to this confidential memo--parts of which were inadvertently  given to the Wall Street Journal years later--the FTC's Bureau of  Competition had recommended that an antitrust lawsuit be filed against  Google for some of its business practices. It said \"Google is in the unique  position of being able to 'make or break any web-based business\" and \"has  strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through  anti-competitive means.\" and \".forestalled competitors and would-be  competitors' ability to challenge those monopolies...\" It specifically  cited Google for stealing competitors' content, and imposing restrictions  on advertisers and other websites that limited their ability to utilize  other search engines. But the recommendations were rejected.</p><p>GARY REBACK: It flatly says that Google's conduct was anti-competitive. It  flatly says that Google's conduct hurt consumers. I mean, what else would  you need to know to vote out a complaint? There it is, written by your own  staff. And yet, nothing happened.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: They closed the case?</p><p>GARY REBACK: They closed the case, correct.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): The FTC's commissioners decided that Google's  conduct could be addressed with voluntary improvements to some of its  business practices, and that Google's decision to move its own products to  the top of the search page could plausibly be of benefit to consumers. But  Reback and others who were directly involved in the investigation have long  suspected that the outcome had something to do with Google's political  muscle in Washington and its close relationship with the Obama  administration. Google spent more money on lobbying last year than any  other corporation, employing twenty-five different firms and helping fund  three hundred trade associations, think tanks and other groups many of  which influence policy.</p><p>GARY REBACK: They have a seat at the table in every discussion that-- that  implicates this issue at all. They know about developments that we never  even hear about. So their influence from my perspective is very, very  difficult to challenge.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Until now the only one taking aggressive action  against Google and big tech is Margrethe Vestager, the competition  commissioner for the European Union. Vestager has become a thorn in the  side of Silicon Valley, fining Facebook a hundred and twenty-two million  dollars for a merger violation and ordering Ireland to recover fifteen  billion dollars in taxes owed by Apple. Last year, she levied a 2.7- billion-dollar fine against Google for depriving certain competitors of a  chance to compete with them.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Just as well as I admire some of the innovation by  Google over the last decade-- well, I want their illegal behavior to stop.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And that's what you feel has gone on.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Not only do we feel it, we-- we mean that we can prove  it.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): In researching the case, Vestager says her staff  went through 1.7 billion Google search queries and found that Google was  manipulating its secret search formulas--or algorithms--to promote its own  products and services and sending its competitors into oblivion.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: It's very difficult to find the rivals. Because on  average, you'd find them only on page four in your search results.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: And why so far down?</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, because then you don't find them. I don't-- I  don't know anyone who goes to page four in their search result. The--  jokingly, you could say that this is where you should keep your secrets.  Because no one ever comes there.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: Do you think this has been deliberate on Google's part?</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Yes. We think that this is done on purpose.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: How do they do it? I mean, I think everybody has this idea  that Google has this algorithm, and they put the best searches right at the  top.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Well, it is exactly the algorithm that does it, both-- the promotion of Google themselves and the demotion of others.</p><p>STEVE KROFT: So, they're rigging the game.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER: Yes. And it is illegal.</p><p>STEVE KROFT (voiceover): Google has paid its 2.7-billion-dollar fine and is  aggressively appealing the decision. But for now, Stoppelman says everyone  is still playing by Google's rules.</p><p>If you're in business, you have to be on Google.</p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN: Yeah. Google wields enormous power across the industry.  And they set the rules. The question is who's watching Google?</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>STEVE KROFT: Since the story aired in May, the European Union has levied  another record fine against Google, this one five billion dollars, for  anti-competitive practices involving its Android mobile software. Google  declined our request for an interview with one of its top executives. It  has also declined to make them available to testify at hearings before  Congress. In a written response to our questions the company denied it was  a monopoly in search or search advertising, citing many competitors  including Amazon and Facebook. It says it does not make changes to its  algorithm to disadvantage competitors and that, quote, \"Our responsibility  is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific  placements for sites within our results. We understand that those sites  whose ranking falls will be unhappy and may complain publicly.\"</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>END    </p><p>[Copy: Content and programming Copyright MMXVIII CBS Broadcasting  Inc.

I'm Alexei Oreskovic, Business Insider's West Coast Bureau Chief and Global Tech Editor. If you want to get Trending in your email inbox every week, just click here.[1] This week: The biggest threat to Facebook and Twitter Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for WIRED25; Francois Mori/AP It feels like ages ago, when the coronavirus lockdowns began in March, that skepticism about social media screentime and digital health were summarily cast aside. Who's got time to worry about those kinds of things when you need a crucial lifeline to the outside world?</p><p>Since then \u2014 notwithstanding the Gen Zers who credit funny memes for giving them the strength to endure the crisis[2] \u2014 our collective relapse into social media has come with harsh reminders of why we grew wary in the first place. Roughly half of the Twitter accounts clamoring to \"reopen America\" are actually bots, according to a recent Carnegie Mellon University study.[3] (Though some have cast doubt on Carnegie Mellon's methodology.[4])Various doctors on Facebook boasting verified \"blue checkmark\" accounts (but not necessarily medical degrees) are pushing coronavirus misinformation and peddling dubious cures to hundreds of thousands of followers.[5]Facebook discovered that more than half of the extremists who join its groups in 2016 were lured by the company's own recommendation tools, but proposals to fix the situation were dismissed or diluted by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and others, according to a Wall Street Journal report.[6]And recent complaints to the FTC claim that TikTok is not complying with the terms of last year's settlement with the agency involving its collection of children's data.[7] On Wednesday, Facebook is holding its annual shareholder meeting (virtually)[8] and Zuckerberg, who has spent the past few years promoting \"time well spent\" on the social network, will have to offer up some explanation for his company's apparent indifference and disdain for its professed values.As far as business problems go right now, Zuckerberg's predicament may seem like a mere PR headache. Facebook's business, at least as of the end of April, was still relatively strong and enchanting investors[9]. That's a much better place to be than federal bankruptcy court, where giant companies like Hertz[10], Gold's Gym and J. Crew are squaring off with creditors[11]; And it's a lot easier than laying off thousands of employees, as General Electric, Uber, IBM and many more are doing[12].But for social media services \u2014 whether it's Facebook, Twitter, or even YouTube \u2014 there's a festering problem within the business that's not reflected in income statements or balance sheet, and it's getting worse every day. Put simply: Social media services have absolutely no idea why they exist anymore other than to simply keep all the plates in the air.Twitter used to brag about being the \"free speech wing of the free speech party.\" You may or may not have admired it, but it was a principle employees and users could understand. Now Twitter is an ugly knot of contradictions and ineffective posturing that's left it in the humiliating position of getting publicly chastised[13] by the very person it's contorted itself for.YouTube, which has the power of Google's army of computer programmers and AI experts behind it, looks incompetent with each new colony of conspiracy videos discovered on its site. And Facebook looks even more brazen and unscrupulous at this point.[14]This isn't a problem that's going to blow a hole in any of these businesses overnight. Facebook's family of apps has 3 billion users. It would be a remarkable feat to lose the trust of 3 billion people at once.But the way it looks now, the biggest threat these businesses face isn't disruption by a new technology or competitor, or even by a regulator [15]or a pandemic. The biggest threat is what the social media companies have done to themselves by disrupting their own sense of purpose. Exodus, Silicon Valley Krivosheev Vitaly/Shutterstock Is Silicon Valley's reign as America's innovation capital over? It's one of the biggest questions being discussed in these parts after several big tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter, announced that employees will be free to work from anywhere.How many employees pack up and relocate to a cozy mountain cabin or a tropical island is an open question, and there are good arguments why the exodus might not be as big as some people expect.[16]But here are 3 reasons why, if nothing else, Silicon Valley is likely to see an influx of movement (both leaving and entering the region): Informal surveys indicate there's significant interest among Silicon Valley techies to relocate to greener pastures, even if moving means having their salaries \"adjusted\" to their new homes.[17]There are lots of places in the US that are not San Francisco, New York, or Boston, that are attracting an increasing share of venture capital dollars.[18]And there's a thriving generation of innovative, VC-backed startups creating tools to cater to remote workers.[19]Sound bite of the week: \"I have no idea why they don't publish articles. I have no idea why we haven't seen anything come out. I don't know why no one seems to know what they're working on doing. It all seems very contrary to the spirit of openness and transparency that advances science, but no, I don't get it; it's not how I envisioned it at all.\"\u2014 Bill Maris, the founder of VC firm Section 32, discusses the state of affairs at Calico, a biotech company at Alphabet that he launched in 2013 while he was still at Google.[20] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/calico-life-sciences-founder-disappointed-with-progress-2020-5\">https://www.businessinsider.com/calico-life-sciences-founder-disappointed-with-progress-2020-5</url> Section 32 Recommended Readings: $3 billion Carta slashed its revenue goal but kept hiring anyway, leading to massive layoffs in April. Insiders describe whiplash and organizational chaos as the company attempts an ambitious new pivot.[21]While Marc Benioff may be avoiding 'major acquisitions,' here are 9 companies that experts think Salesforce could buy as the coronavirus crisis drives down valuations[22]Japanese tech giant NTT is making a $230 million bet on upending healthcare with 'digital twins,' an exact virtual replica of a person that can be used with AI to explore new treatments without risking the patient[23]Here's how note-taking app Evernote, once a high-flying unicorn startup, is 'going back to basics' by completely rebuilding its app to win back the skeptical users it lost[24]Microsoft just revealed its first industry-specific cloud for healthcare and recent hires hint which industries could be next[25] Not necessarily in tech: Pay rifts, a partner divide, and a threat at the Ritz Carlton: 50 insiders reveal all on a massive shakeup at elite law firm Boies Schiller[26]That's going to do it for this week.

In most ways, its hyperintelligent reality seems far off. That's because Nathan, a reclusive CEO played with brogrammer chill by Oscar Isaac (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Inside Llewyn Davis</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> A Most Violent Year</emphasis>), has invited Caleb to his secluded house-turned-laboratory to show off Ava (Alicia Vikander), the artificially intelligent humanoid he's built. \"What do you think?\" he asks his employee winkingly, though we can tell that Nathan's interested in more than just a product assessment.</p><p>And there, confined to Nathan's faraway, super-controlled den, this claustrophobic thriller unwinds in a series of \"sessions\" between Caleb and the bot. Ava is gorgeous, if you don't mind scaly mechanical coils filling in the female form, and sharp too. She answers Caleb's queries, pokes flirty fun at his word choices and, intriguingly, instigates recurring power glitches, when Nathan's video surveillance shuts down just long enough for the bot to slip Caleb ominous warnings. She knows something. Those moments when Nathan isn't listening are rare; that's the first clue that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ex Machina</emphasis>'s setting has more to do with the present technological milieu than it appears.</p><p>The film's unraveling is as slow and methodical as you imagine Nathan's creation process to be, and frequently invokes the Turing Test. Named for computer scientist Alan Turing, the test is passed when an evaluator conversing with both a person and a machine cannot, after repeated attempts, tell which is which. By those standards, Ava \"is incredible,\" Caleb gushes, his laboratory detachment melting into genuine infatuation. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ex Machina</emphasis> heads toward its showdown, Ava's presence elevates the film into a futuristic vision that's as beautiful as it is paranoid. In Garland's words, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ex Machina</emphasis> was \"all about Ava before I even had written the first line.\"</p><p>But despite these far-off technological leaps, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ex Machina</emphasis> feels very much a part of the current cultural moment, in which great big tech companies have grown nearly as powerful as the governments that try--and often fail--to regulate them. Consider Bluebook, the company where Caleb works and for which Nathan wrote the code at the age of 13. It's the Internet's most popular search engine. In one snatch of dialogue, we learn that it draws 94 percent of all Internet search traffic. Sound like Google? It's not directly based on the search giant, Garland says in an interview with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis>. But it is based on a more generalized anxiety about the power companies like Google and Facebook wield.</p><p>\"I have no idea whether anything that any of these big companies does is evil or wrong or problematic,\" explains Garland, a novelist-turned-filmmaker whose screenplay credits include <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Never Let Me Go</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">28 Days Later</emphasis>. \"My position is that they're very powerful. And in that respect, it doesn't matter whether they're doing anything wrong or not. If you're that powerful, you need oversight, because our history, with very powerful people and organizations, is that they need oversight. Always.\"</p><p>A search engine, separate from whatever services it provides, acts as a massive data repository. By one estimate, Google holds more than 10 exabytes' worth of data--that's about 625 million standard 16-gigabyte iPhones. Much of it, presumably, is X-rated. Similarly, Facebook can tell with a significant degree of accuracy who you're in a relationship with and who you might date next. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ex Machina</emphasis>, Caleb wonders if Nathan glanced at his porn preferences and designed to his liking. (Is that supposed to draw a laugh or a grimace of recognition?) The CEO soon reveals that he <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">has </emphasis>harvested data from smartphone cameras around the globe to fast-track Ava's emotional growth. It's a clever hack--and one that taps into any mobile-using human's anxiety about 24-hour self-enabled surveillance.</p><p>And other kinds of surveillance too. Shortly before principal photography began on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ex Machina</emphasis> in 2013, Edward Snowden's security leaks prompted an international debate on National Security Agency spying. \"For me, the Snowden revelations were very important in many different ways,\" Garland says. \"They drew attention to the problematic ways that tech companies and governments could work with each other, which I think is really serious and really something that should be very alarming.... It confirmed what we feared. But we feared it already.\"</p><p>Garland bristles at the suggestion that the power of Bluebook--and its founder--is a dystopian vision. \"It's not dystopian. Because you have very big tech companies now, which may or may not be dystopian,\" he says. \"There's notions of oversight over some of these companies, so theoretical oversight...but is there <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">actual </emphasis>oversight? I don't know.\" The director says it's ambivalence, not outright alarm, that gnaws at him: \"There's stuff about Google I like; there's stuff about power that scares me.\"</p><p>The resulting film is a profoundly anxious movie for an anxious era. It would hardly necessitate a spoiler warning to say that Nathan's experiments in artificial intelligence yield violent and unanticipated results.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ex Machina </emphasis>is more creeping dread than Hollywood action--which proves all the more unsettling. The CEO's sleek playpen becomes a prison. Caleb, ever the experimenter, realizes he's a rat in the maze. Ever been experimented on without realizing you were the subject of an experiment? Ever used Facebook? In one of numerous instances, the social media behemoth took heat for a 2012 experiment that tweaked users' newsfeeds for a study on \"emotional contagion.\"</p><p>For Nathan, the brave new singularity beckons, and he's impatient to meet it. \"One day,\" he tells Caleb, \"the AI's are gonna look back on us the same way we look back at fossils.\" Maybe--but not soon. Familiar ethical quandaries aside, a machine like Ava is not quite within reach, the director concedes. True, we've integrated responsive bots like Siri into our daily life. \"You end up having those experiences [with robots] if you have a cellphone these days.\" But, Garland says, \"we are not about to have sentient machines. I think it's a distant future for all of us.\"</p><p>And yet artificial intelligence is having a cinematic moment. Spike Jonze's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Her</emphasis>, in which Scarlett Johansson voiced the AI operating-system-turned-love-interest Samantha, charmed both audiences and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2013. Johansson further explored the post-human seductress genre in 2014's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Under the Skin</emphasis>. That same year, in real-world St. Petersburg, a chatbot disguised as a 13-year-old was said to have passed the Turing Test, although Garland is skeptical.</p><p>So <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ex Machina</emphasis> is poignantly timed, while also fitting into a long tradition of almost-but-not-quite-horror movies in which experiments in what it means to create or re-create artificial human life bring alluring promises and terrifying results. Think <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Seconds</emphasis>, the chilling 1966 cult flick from John Frankenheimer, or, more recently <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Skin I Live In</emphasis>, the artificial skin nightmare from Pedro Almod\u00f3var.</p><p>The difference is that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ex Machina</emphasis>'s code-crazy creator doesn't much resemble the archetypal mad scientist or social pariah from movies past. He's a more contemporary figure: the CEO of a huge, unwieldy technology company much like the ones whose products we rely on daily. People of Nathan's ilk are in charge of the world--yes, IRL.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWEEK-NW327761_2015-05-15.SIG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWEEK2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G1H-J2T1-DYR7-G02V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">5774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1273\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Newsweek Inc.

Unfortunately, too much of the thinking around this can be summarized as \"these companies are bad, we should punish them, any punishment therefore is good.\" This is dangerous thinking. I tend to agree with Benedict Evans who noted that there's a similarity between calls to break up big tech companies and Brexit[1] in the UK: 'Break up Google/Amazon/Facebook!'</p><p> reminds me a lot of Brexit. It sounds really good, until you ask 'well, into what?', or 'and what specific problem does this solve?' \u2014 Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) June 9, 2019[2]I've pointed out [3] a few times now that most calls to break up or regulate these companies fail to explain how these plansactually solve[4] the problems people highlight. Companies are callous about our privacy? Will regulating them or breaking them up actually stop that? The GDPR has proven otherwise already. The companies algorithms recommend bad things? How will breaking them up stop that? Too much of the thinking seems to just be focused on \"company bad, must punish\"[5] and don't get much beyond that. And that's a pretty big problem, because many of the ideas being passed around could ultimately end up harming the wider internet much more than they end up damaging the few big companies anyway. We've already seen that with the GDPR, which has served to further entrench[6] the giants. The same will almost certainly be true when the EU Copyright Directive goes into effect, since the entire plan is designed to entrench the giants so that the big entertainment companies can negotiate new licensing deals with them. In a new piece for the Economist, Cory Doctorow warns that many of these attempts to \"harm\" the big internet companies through regulation will actually do much more harm to the wider internet[7], while making the biggest companies stronger.The past 12 months have seen a blizzard of new internet regulations that, ironically, have done more to enshrine Big Tech's dominance than the decades of lax antitrust enforcement that preceded them. This will have grave consequences for privacy, free expression and safety.He talks about the GDPR, FOSTA, the EU Copyright Directive and various \"terrorist\" and \"online harms\" regulatory proposals -- all of which end up making the big internet companies more powerful in the name of \"regulating/punishing\" them. It's worth reading Cory's take on all those laws, but he summarizes the key point here:Creating state-like duties for the big tech platforms imposes short-term pain on their shareholders in exchange for long-term gain. Shaving a few hundred million dollars off a company's quarterly earnings to pay for compliance is a bargain in exchange for a world in which they need not fear a rival growing large enough to compete with them. Google can stop looking over its shoulder for the next company that will do to it what it did to Yahoo, and Facebook can stop watching for someone ready to cast it in the role of MySpace, in the next social media upheaval. These duties can only be performed by the biggest companies, which all-but forecloses on the possibility of breaking up Big Tech. Once it has been knighted to serve as an arm of the state, Big Tech cannot be cut down to size if it is to perform those duties.Cory is much more engaged in the idea of breaking up the big tech companies than I am (we recently debated the topic[8] on the Techdirt podcast), but his point here is valid. So much of the \"punish big tech\" movement is at odds with other parts of the \"punish big tech\" movement. That's because there is no coherent strategy here -- it's just \"punish big tech.\" Cory's article suggests that any move towards antitrust should include mandating interoperability in an effort to build up competition:One exciting possibility is to create an absolute legal defence for companies that make \"interoperable\" products that plug into the dominant companies' offerings, from third-party printer ink to unauthorised Facebook readers that slurp up all the messages waiting for you there and filter them to your specifications, not Mark Zuckerberg's. This interoperability defence would have to shield digital toolsmiths from all manner of claims: tortious interference, bypassing copyright locks, patent infringement and, of course, violating terms of service. Interoperability is a competitive lever that is crying to be used, hard. After all, the problem with YouTube isn't that it makes a lot of interesting videos available\u2014it is that it uses search and suggestion filters that lead viewers into hateful, extreme bubbles. The problem with Facebook isn't that they have made a place where all your friends can be found\u2014it is that it tries to \"maximise engagement\" by poisoning your interactions with inflammatory or hoax material.This actually reminds me of another similar piece, written last month by Josh Constine at TechCrunch, arguing that the FTC should force Facebook to mandate \"friend portability\"[9] for Facebook:I don't expect the FTC to launch its own 'Fedbook' social network. But what it can do is pave an escape route from Facebook so worthy alternatives become viable options. That's why the FTC must require Facebook to offer truly interoperable data portability for the social graph. In other words, the government should pass regulations forcing Facebook to let you export your friend list to other social networks in a privacy-safe way. This would allow you to connect with or follow those people elsewhere so you could leave Facebook without losing touch with your friends. The increased threat of people ditching Facebook for competitors would create a much stronger incentive to protect users and society.Both Cory and Josh are making an important point: part of the reason why these platforms have become so big and so powerful is because there is real friction in leaving -- not because it's hard to just start using another platform, but because if all the other users are still on that other platform, it's meaningless if just you switch. Of course, history shows us that over time, many people will migrate over to new platforms. And you know this if you've been on the internet for the past two decades. Remember the 2000s when you used AIM to communicate with your friends while chatting with folks on MySpace? Over time, folks moved. But making platforms more open -- forcing \"interoperability\" -- is certainly one way forward. I'd actually argue it does not go far enough. I've argued an even better solution is not just about forced interoperability, but moving to a world of protocols instead of platforms[10]. In such a world, interoperability would be standard, but would also be just one piece of the puzzle for making the world more dynamic and competitive. If we relied on more open platforms, then third parties could build all sorts of new services, from better front ends, to better features and tools, and users could choose which implementation(s) they wanted to use, making switching from any particular service provider much easier -- especially if that provider did anything to hurt user trust. Interoperability would be one step in that direction, but only one step. It's quite reasonable that people are concerned about big tech these days, but if we're going to have a reasonable solution that doesn't create wider negative consequences for the internet, we should be thinking much more carefully about the various proposals on the table. A simple \"punish big tech because big tech is bad\" may get people riled up, but the chances for negative consequences are too great to ignore.Permalink[11] | Comments[12] | Email This Story[13] [

They mostly comprise the big tech companies, like Google and Facebook, and big pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>These increasingly globalised firms have been enjoying sustained and extraordinary returns.</p><p>In the 1960s, the top 10 per cent of firms by return on invested capital enjoyed returns of around 10 per cent a year. Today, the top 10 per cent of firms are enjoying annual returns of 100 per cent.</p><p>Those blockbuster returns are not fleeting. Of firms in the top 10 per cent by performance in 2003, 85 per cent were still in the top 10 per cent in 2013.</p><p>\"The rocket ships are not just going up and crashing, they are going up and continuing to go up,\" Orszag told the conference.</p><p>That good fortune spills over into higher wages for all tech and pharma employees.</p><p>\"Anyone at that firm is doing great, if you're not at that firm, not so much.\"</p><p>Sure, CEOs are still richer than their employees.</p><p>But mid-level employees at Facebook have been getting richer quicker than comparable employees at US manufacturing firms.</p><p>Inequality has been rising between firms, not within them.</p><p>\"It may be that we have dramatically mischaracterised a lot of what's driving increasing inequality in the US,\" Orszag told this week's conference.</p><p>If we have, the usually policy remedies, like boosting top tax rates and spending more on education, won't solve the problem.</p><p>If we want to stop the rise in inequality - which recent studies have suggested has become harmful to economic growth - we need to focus on what is driving the super profits of some firms.</p><p>Usually, you'd expect competition to erode such super normal returns.</p><p>But this hasn't happened for the tech and pharma giants.</p><p>Perhaps they're just wonderful companies, run by excellent managers who make better decisions than their competitors.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>A more likely explanation is that these companies benefit in some way from a lack of competition.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies obviously benefit from the awarding of patent rights, which give them the incentive to develop new technologies. Perhaps that incentive is larger than it needs to be.</p><p>But how to explain the monopolistic hue of large tech companies?</p><p>One would think the world of technology is fast moving, with little barriers to entry. But many of the big tech companies operate in markets which exhibit a unique \"winner takes all\" character, giving rise to natural monopolies.</p><p>Facebook benefits from being the biggest entrenched social network.</p><p>Similarly, Google benefits from being the biggest and most recognisable search engine.</p><p>In this sense, they are natural monopolies, much like the copper wires that Telstra owns that go to your house or the poles and wires of electricity companies.</p><p>Monopolists are able to extract \"rents\": returns above what would be needed to keep them in business.</p><p>That's bad, because it usually means consumers pay higher prices than others.</p><p>Monopolists then divert some of their profits into lobbying government to set the rules of the game even further in their favour, a process known as \"rent seeking\".</p><p>Hello Gina.</p><p>Historically, governments regulate natural monopolies by setting their prices or dictating access by third parties.</p><p>Orszag says it's an open question whether such remedies need to be applied to tech monopolies.</p><p>Perhaps they're just great businesses, or maybe, as Orszag says, they're \"monopolies that are using our personal information without paying us and extracting a monopoly rent by selling ads based on that personal information.\"</p><p>If we want to tackle inequality, Orszag prescribes a greater focus on anti-trust and competition policy.</p><p>Interestingly, he also flags housing policy as an important tool to tackle inequality.</p><p>Basically, people need to be able to afford to live near the rocket ship companies to get on board.</p><p>\"If the price of a house is extraordinarily expensive in the rocket ship areas, because wages have been bid up there, it is very difficult for you to move into that local labour market and up your chances of being able to hop on to one of the rocket ships,\" he says.</p><p>Government regulations often impede the supply of new land, keeping property prices high.</p><p>This has a doubling down effect of rewarding starship employees not only with supersized pay packets, but excessive returns on their housing investments relative to other workers.</p><p>Does Orszag's thesis apply to Australia?</p><p>It's hard to tell. Australia has long been an oligopolist's paradise. Like Noah and his Ark, our companies come two by two: two airlines, two supermarkets, two telcos.</p><p>Perhaps a higher proportion of Aussie workers are already sharing in the economic rents of their employers, keeping our wages growth higher than in the US.</p><p>The price Aussies pay is higher retail prices from a lack of competition, like the higher interest rates we will pay now the banks have a stranglehold on the mortgage market.</p><p>Certainly, the price of property near our two biggest CBDs - where most of our large oligopolists have their headquarters - has gone up like a rocket, potentially making it harder for low wage workers to access these jobs.</p><p>Competition policy and housing policy will prove key to the future of inequality in Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-72348227</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H6V-JGT1-DYTG-22M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1070\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>October 24, 2015 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook mining our personal data and - best-case scenario - unabashedly using it to sell us stuff.<br/>What's a society to do? Ours has begun clamoring for boycotts and regulation, even for\u00a0breaking up the biggest tech giants. For a decade (or two), the tech industry, led by the largest, most successful companies, has painted attempts to regulate it as stifling innovation; an impediment to the new, utopian \"tech will solve everything\" system these benevolent founders seek to build. Maybe that's true, but considering the aforementioned abuses, the \"Don't be evil\" edict seems to hold less water, and #deletefacebook\u00a0might finally be having its moment.</p><p><br/>Presidential candidates have made trust-busting a part of their platforms. Europe and California have instituted legislation designed to allow citizens greater control over their personal data and how it's used. Other states are following suit, buoyed by bipartisan support. It feels like major tech regulation is coming, but whether it's a culmination of decades of regulatory decisions or just a step on the path is unclear.\u00a0<br/>'Free' Isn't FreeYou probably know some of the basics of how internet advertising targets its viewers. Sometimes, ads might seem a little\u00a0too\u00a0relevant, leading you to wonder whether your phone is listening to your conversations. You feel uneasy about it, even as you admit that you'd rather see ads for stuff you like than for something completely uninteresting to you. From the advertisers' perspective, it's much more efficient to target just a few people and make sure those people see their ads rather than waste time and money putting ads in front of people who don't need or care about what they're selling. The companies that do this\u00a0can even track\u00a0whether a user who has seen a particular ad then visits the store in question.\u00a0<br/>We've settled into a \"freemium\" model: In exchange for our data, we get to use free services, including email and social media. This is how companies such as Facebook make money and still provide us with the services we enjoy (although research has shown that spending more time on Facebook makes you\u00a0less happy, rather than more).\u00a0<br/>Image credit: Ink Drop/Shutterstock<br/>But there's more than one reason to\u00a0be concerned about letting our personal data be sucked up by tech companies. There are many ways the wholesale gathering of data is being abused or could be abused, from blackmail to targeted harassment to political lies and election meddling. It reinforces monopolies and has led to discrimination and exclusion, according to a 2020\u00a0report from the Norwegian Consumer Council. At its worst, it disrupts the integrity of the democratic process (more on this later).\u00a0<br/>Increasingly, private data collection is described in terms of human rights - your thoughts and opinions and ideas are your own, and so is any data that describes them. Therefore, collection of it without your consent is theft. There's also the security of all this data and the risk to consumers (and the general public) when a company slips up and some entity - hackers, Russia, China - gets access to it.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"You've certainly had a lot of political chaos in the US and elsewhere, coinciding with the tech industry finally falling back to Earth and no longer getting a pass from our general skepticism of big companies,\" says Mitch Stoltz, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"If so many people weren't getting the majority of their information about the world from Facebook, then Facebook's policies about political advertising (or most anything else) wouldn't feel like life and death.\"<br/>Policy suggestions include the Honest Ads Act, first introduced in 2017 by Senators Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar, which would require online political ads to carry information about who paid for them and who they targeted, similar to how political advertising works on TV and radio. This was in part a response to the\u00a0Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2016.<br/>Cambridge Analytica blows up\u00a0It's easy to beat up on Facebook. It's not the only social network with questionable data-collection policies, but it is the biggest. Facebook lets you build a personal profile, connect that profile to others, and communicate via messages, posts, and responses to others' posts, photos, and videos. It's free to use, and the company makes its money by selling ads, which you see as you browse your pages. What could go wrong?\u00a0<br/>In 2013, a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan developed an app version of a personality quiz called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" and started sharing it on Facebook. He'd pay users to take the test, ostensibly for the purposes of psychological research. This was acceptable under Facebook policy at the time. What wasn't acceptable (according to Facebook, although it may have given its tacit approval, according to whistleblowers in the documentary\u00a0The Great Hack) was that the quiz didn't just record your answers - it also scraped all your data, including your likes, posts, and even private messages. Worse, it collected data from all your Facebook friends, whether or not they took the quiz. At best guess, the profiles of\u00a087 million people\u00a0were harvested.\u00a0<br/>Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill, April 2018<br/>Image credit: Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images<br/>Kogan was a researcher at Cambridge University, as well as St. Petersburg State University, but he shared that data with Cambridge Analytica. The company used the data to create robust psychological profiles of people and target some of them with political ads that were most likely to influence them. Steve Bannon, who was Cambridge Analytica's vice president, brought this technique and data\u00a0to the Trump 2016 campaign, which leveraged it to sway swing voters, often on the back of dubious or inflammatory information. A similar tactic was employed by the company in the\u00a02016 \"Brexit\" referendum.\u00a0<br/>In 2017, data consultant and Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie blew the whistle on the company. This set off a chain of events that would land Facebook in the hot seat and Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0in front of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Giving this the best possible spin, it's a newer, better version of what\u00a0President Obama's campaign did, leveraging clever social-media techniques and new technology to build a smoother, more effective, occasionally underhanded but not outright illegal or immoral political-advertising industry, which everyone would be using soon.\u00a0<br/>A darker interpretation: It's \"weaponized data,\" as the whistleblowers have called it; psyops that use information-warfare techniques borrowed from institutions like the Department of Defense to leverage our information against us, corrupting our democratic process to the point that we can't even tell if we're voting for (or against) something because we believe it or because a data-fueled AI knew just what psychological lever to push. Even applied to advertisements, this is scary. Did I buy a particular product because its manufacturer knew just how and when to make me want it? Which decisions that we make are our own?<br/>The irony is that Facebook was sold to its early users as a privacy-forward service.<br/>\"You might say 'Well, what happened before the last election - that was pretty darn malicious,'\" says Vasant Dhar, a professor of data science at the NYU Stern Center of Business. \"Some people might say, 'I don't know - that wasn't that malicious, there's nothing wrong with using social media for influence; and besides, there's no smoking gun, there's no proof that it actually did anything.' And that's a reasonable position too.\"<br/>The irony is that Facebook was sold to its early users as a privacy-forward service. You might remember how MySpace faded into oblivion after Facebook arrived. That wasn't an accident; Facebook intentionally painted itself as an alternative to the wide-open world of MySpace.\u00a0<br/>Zuckerberg and co-founder Chris Hughes in 2004.<br/>Image credit: Rick Friedman/Corbis via Getty Images<br/>At this time, \"privacy was ... a crucial form of competition,\" researcher Dina Srinivasan, a Fellow at the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale University, wrote in her\u00a0Berkeley Business Law Journal\u00a0paper, \"The Antitrust Case Against Facebook.\" Since social media was free, and no company had a stranglehold on the market, the promise of privacy was an important differentiation. You needed a .edu email address to sign up for Facebook, and only your friends could see what you were saying. Facebook made this promise initially: \"We do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user.\" In contrast, MySpace had a policy in which anyone could see anyone else's profile. Users, deciding they favored privacy, decamped en masse.<br/>How things went wonkyImage credit: Daniel Chetroni/Shutterstock<br/>Later, as Facebook gathered market share - outlasting, outcompeting, or just buying other services - it tried to roll back some of those privacy promises. In 2007, the company released Beacon, which tracked Facebook users while they visited other sites. And in 2010, it introduced the \"Like\" button, which enabled the company to track users (whether or not they clicked on the button) on pages where it was installed.\u00a0<br/>By 2014, after buying Instagram and with a record-setting IPO under its belt,\u00a0Facebook announced\u00a0publicly that it would be using code on third-party websites to track and surveil people - thus reneging on the promise it had used to establish market dominance in the first place. In 2017,\u00a0Facebook paid\u00a0a $122 million fine in Europe for violating a promise it made not to share WhatsApp data with the rest of the company, which it then did.\u00a0<br/>In 2019, the FTC announced a\u00a0$5 billion settlement\u00a0with Facebook for a variety of privacy violations, including Cambridge Analytica and lying about its facial-recognition software. And in January of this year, Facebook said it\u00a0would not limit\u00a0political ads, even false ones. And it won't fact-check ads or prevent them from targeting particular groups, which is precisely what happened with Cambridge Analytica. Currently, the company is\u00a0facing intense criticism\u00a0over its proposed cryptocurrency, Libra.<br/>Image credit: vchal/Shutterstock.com<br/>To scholars like Srinivasan, this is a classic example of a monopoly leveraging its power to make more money at the expense of consumers - not a fiscal expense, since the service is free, but by delivering a worse product; in this case, a product offering less privacy. Market share in social media doesn't work quite like it does in other industries: The network effect creates a positive feedback loop where, as a site gathers users, it becomes more attractive\u00a0because\u00a0of those users, making it particularly hard for a competitor to gain traction. While a company's size isn't an indication that it has abused its power, we put up with privacy invasions from Facebook because we don't have alternatives.<br/>\"I want to be a subscriber to a social network, like Facebook, which has more people,\" says Nicholas Economides, a professor of economics at the NYU Stern School of Business. \"Big size is rewarded. If some company manages to really [gain] big, big market share, like Facebook, or Google in its own area, then it gets big benefits. Consumers really like to be with them. That means they have abilities to control the market.\"<br/>At this point, Facebook had so much of the market that third parties such as news sites couldn't very well uninstall their Like buttons - they needed them to drive traffic.\u00a0<br/>Big tech's version of monopoliesBill Gates and Steve Ballmer in 2000<br/>Image credit: DAN LEVINE/AFP via Getty Images<br/>Now that we're talking about monopolies, it's time to bring in Microsoft. In 1995, sensing that controlling how people moved across the internet might be even more valuable than the operating systems it already installed on everybody's computers, Microsoft bundled the Internet Explorer browser into its Windows OS, thus making sure that every computer came with a ready-to-go default browser - Microsoft's own.\u00a0<br/>The Department of Justice sued Microsoft, and after a long trial and lots of testimony, a judge ruled that Microsoft be broken up into one part that runs the Windows operating system and another part that does everything else. An appeals court later reduced the penalty, but weakening Microsoft paved the way for a period of technological innovation that gave us Google, Facebook, Amazon, and a renewed Apple. Many economists say that this was the last major antitrust action.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>In the 1980s or so, an economic theory known as the\u00a0Chicago School\u00a0began to gain favor among lawmakers and judges. It takes a\u00a0laissez faire\u00a0approach to antitrust law, limiting the definition of harm to consumers to price increases and claiming the market will sort everything else out. When the price of your social media network, email system, or video hosting is free, it's near impossible to bring an antitrust suit under this theory. But we need to stop thinking about the users as the customers, according to NYU's Dhar. \"Customers are the people paying them, and users aren't paying them,\" he says. \"The users are just supplying them the data that they're using for the advertising.\"<br/>\"The tech industry confounds a lot of the antitrust orthodoxy that is applied in the courts and the government enforcement agencies ... because competition works differently,\" says the EFF's Stoltz. \"Instead of having multiple similar products competing, you have different products, but they compete with one another for access to data, for customer loyalty, and for venture capital.\"<br/>In spite of this, states are beginning to take action. A coalition of 50 attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton from Texas, have\u00a0announced an investigation into Google\u00a0over its dominance in advertising and how it uses data to maintain that, and others have begun pursuing Facebook over allegations of anti-competitive advertising rates and product quality. The House Judiciary Committee and Antitrust Subcommittee have been hearing arguments about the role of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple to decide whether the companies have abused their market power. And politicians at the national level, particularly during candidacy, have\u00a0threatened specific actions, including splitting Instagram from Facebook.\u00a0<br/>To some degree, this is self-interest, says NYU's Economides. Facebook's News Feed and Google News reach a large enough portion of Americans that those platforms can have a big impact on what we see, intentionally or not. Most people probably won't scroll past their first page of results after a search, so what bubbles to the top (and what doesn't) is hugely important. \"That gives a tremendous amount of power to these companies to shape the political debate ... and it's very hard to take it away,\" says Economides.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>In 2011, FTC staff concluded that Google had used anticompetitive practices and abused monopoly power.<br/>Google has faced several antitrust investigations. In 2011, FTC staff concluded that Google had used anticompetitive practices and abused monopoly power, including skewing search results to favor its own shopping, travel, and finance sites, and copying content from other sites only to leverage it against them - and threatening to remove them from search if they complained. In 2013, following some concessions by Google but\u00a0no promises to stop the worst offenses, FTC commissioners voted unanimously to end the investigation. Then in 2019, the FTC\u00a0fined Google $170 million\u00a0for tracking the viewing histories of children on YouTube.\u00a0<br/>Also in 2019,\u00a0Google partnered with Ascension, a health care operator across 21 states, to obtain lab results, doctor diagnoses, hospitalization records, medications, medical conditions, radiology scans, birth dates and names, addresses, family members, allergies, immunizations, and more from millions of patients without notifying them or their doctors, much less obtaining their consent. This was not a violation of HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), as Google was providing AI software to help suggest better care options for patients. But Google has also\u00a0sought FTC permission to buy Fitbit, which would give the company even more data on user health, such as sleep schedules, exercise, and heart rate. The Ascension partnership plus the proposed purchase have sparked privacy concerns among lawmakers (the Fitbit deal has not yet been approved).<br/>Fitbit Ionic<br/>Image credit: Fitbit<br/>Amazon, meanwhile, has captured its market on the back of years of operating at a loss, focusing on growth over profits, predatory pricing, and vertical integration that allows it to exert price pressure on competitors or even\u00a0leverage\u00a0its delivery and distribution network against them. Often this has resulted in unfriendly takeovers, like the\u00a0case of Diapers.com. Amazon tracked prices for diapers on competitor diapers.com, maintained lower prices, and offered promos and discounts in a newly introduced \"Amazon Mom\" program, only to\u00a0cut the discounts\u00a0once Diapers.com's parent company was forced to sell to Amazon.<br/>\"Amazon is exploiting the fact that some of its customers are also its rivals,\" concludes Lina Khan, author of\u00a0a 2017\u00a0Yale Law Review\u00a0article\u00a0on how Amazon has confounded traditional antitrust understandings.<br/>Image credit: Helen H. Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images<br/>The company watches third-party sellers for success stories\u00a0only to offer similar products under its\u00a0AmazonBasics brand, at a lower price. Furthermore, the company\u00a0sets prices variably, depending on several factors, often many times per day. The company has\u00a0said\u00a0it does not show different prices to different customers, but the practice makes it hard to prove predatory pricing.<br/>There are consumer benefits to Amazon's business model. Amazon makes lots of products widely available, and in the case of popular items, very cheap. Its drive for growth over profit has allowed it to woo customers and revolutionize e-commerce. Amazon Prime, for instance, doesn't exist to make money; its purpose is to get people to shop\u00a0only on Amazon.\u00a0<br/>The value of dataData comes into play here, too. Amazon has its own troves, especially related to consumer behavior, which is especially valuable to advertisers. It can trace who has bought what, and when, and from whom (and what you've asked Alexa), even things you've browsed but not purchased or how long something sat in your cart.\u00a0<br/>Amazon holds onto data you voluntarily give it, including contacts, images and video you've uploaded, special-occasion reminders, playlists, watch lists, wish lists, and more. And the company automatically collects your location, app use, and what websites you visit before and after coming to Amazon.com. In Amazon Go stores and stores that use its Just Walk Out technology, video and\u00a0deep-learning\u00a0AI to track who grabs what.<br/>Image credit: VDB Photos/Shutterstock<br/>This kind of data collection is not only done by the tech giants. For instance, weather apps track your location even when you're not using the apps, unless you opt out. That's ostensibly to provide instantaneous access to weather information wherever you are, but many of them sell your location information to third parties, a practice for which the City of Los Angeles\u00a0sued The Weather Company.<br/>RELATED<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Why Google Can't Solve the Privacy Paradox</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The Big Data Market Is Set to Skyrocket by 2022</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The UK Is Trying to Regulate the Internet: Here's What It Means</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Some apps are sharing very sensitive information, such as an individual's\u00a0sexuality or HIV status. And even though Grindr said it would quit sharing HIV status, Google\u00a0allows\u00a0third parties to learn what apps you use - and if advertisers know you use Grindr, they can make a pretty safe guess as to your sexual orientation. If you've filled out an\u00a0OkCupid\u00a0profile, you'll remember how it asks you personal questions about your drug use, political party, sexual proclivities, and what side of the bed you like to sleep on. This info is used to help select matches for you, but the company is also\u00a0sending that information\u00a0to an adtech company called Braze.\u00a0<br/>Earlier this year,\u00a0the FCC fined\u00a0major cell phone providers $200 million for selling consumers' real-time location data to third parties.\u00a0The New York Timesobtained one file\u00a0of such data, which it used to discover cell phone users' addresses and places of work, including public officials and political protesters. \"They can see the places you go every moment of the day, whom you meet with or spend the night with, where you pray, whether you visit a methadone clinic, a psychiatrist's office or a massage parlor,\" the\u00a0Times\u00a0reported.<br/>The business of selling dataSo who's buying that information? It's not advertisers, at least not at first. A shadowy network of hundreds (or maybe thousands) of third parties known as \"data brokers\" (or sometimes the \"adtech\" industry, though the two are not precisely interchangeable),\u00a0collect and process data\u00a0from many distinct sources, including credit reporting, ID verification, public records, smartphone data, browser history, loyalty programs, social media, credit card transactions, connected devices, information scraped from websites, market research, and so on. Some of it is publicly available, and some of it is purchased.\u00a0<br/>These are companies you probably haven't heard of. They use a unique identification number to collate huge parcels of information on us. They've built a virtual profile of you not unlike what Cambridge Analytica did. So you're influenced by factors you're unaware of but that the data brokers know all about: They know which buttons to push or levers to pull and when to get you to do what they want.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Those ads that make it seem like\u00a0your phone is listening, but perhaps they're so good at understanding you that they are actually predicting what you'll be talking about. This isn't as far out as it sounds. If their profile of you is inclusive of your interests, an AI with sufficient data can likely infer many of your topics of conversation.<br/>It's not just about selling you things; it's also about persuading you to do things, which happens to be buying what an advertiser wants you to buy.<br/>Remember, this all rides on big data. It's not that at one time you bought this thing and you posted your mood about it and therefore they\u00a0think\u00a0maybe you'll be interested in this other thing. It's aggregating all the places you've gone and all the things you've bought to make predictions of your consumer behavior. Then that gets sold to advertisers. It's not just about selling you things; it's also about persuading you to do things, which happens to be buying what an advertiser wants you to buy.<br/>Your data is often sold to advertisers, but data brokers can also sell to other parties, including\u00a0credit scoring and insurance companies. And because two individuals won't see the same ads, it's difficult to spot price discrimination, disinformation, and other exclusions. The brokers put together lists that potential advertisers might be interested in, such as homeowners, runners, or video gamers - but sometimes it can get much darker, as in 2013, when data broker MEDbase 200 was caught offering lists of\u00a0rape victims, alcoholics, and sufferers of erectile dysfunction. And in 2017, Facebook allowed housing advertisers to ensure that ads for housing were\u00a0not shown to African Americans, and boasted to other advertisers the ability to target teens who felt insecure, worthless, anxious, useless, and more.\u00a0<br/>Once an entity has bought your data, there's a bidding war. From the time you click on a page to when the ads load on that page, potential advertisers use automated tools to\u00a0bid on how much they are willing to pay for you to see an ad, and the results of that real-time bidding are then added to your profile.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Amazon, for example, does not sell the data it collects (which you can see and control\u00a0here). But it does allow third parties that serve ads to install cookies, which they can use to gain information about you, including your\u00a0IP address\u00a0and more. And Amazon does buy data from data brokers, in what's called \"pseudonymized\" form - your name is replaced with a different identifier, like a random number - which can then be paired with your profile to target ads. As the\u00a0Times\u00a0found, it's easy for parties that have some portion of your data to match it to other bits, to create those robust, predictive profiles.<br/>What are lawmakers doing about this?\u00a0Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand<br/>Image credit: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images<br/>Several recent major pieces of legislation have tackled the privacy problem, and more are forthcoming. The EU, in 2018, implemented the\u00a0General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies standards for keeping data secure, a legal liability if companies fail, and required practices if a hack should occur. It also gives citizens the right to access their personal data and to ask the companies holding it to delete it.<br/>In 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect, which is similar in some ways to the GDPR, allowing internet users to request the data that has been collected on them (and learn where it was sold), to request that it be deleted, and to opt out of future collection. Facebook, Google, and many others revamped their privacy pages, allowing users to toggle what the companies could and could not collect, and what they could and could not do with what they collected. The law applies to data brokers too, but you have to contact each one yourself, assuming you can find them. So a startup called DoNotPay has begun\u00a0offering an automated service\u00a0that contacts data brokers on your behalf and demands that they delete your info.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In the absence of a national policy, other states are building their own legislation. A number of states, from\u00a0Florida\u00a0to\u00a0Washington state, considered consumer privacy bills this year, but\u00a0few gained any real traction, in part due to COVID-19 restrictions. In Congress, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has proposed the\u00a0Data Protection Act, which would create an independent federal agency to oversee data privacy and security.<br/>Privacy groups and tech companies have pointed out flaws in some of these regulations, including loopholes (companies may reject user requests for data, for example, saying they require identity confirmation). Remember that real-time bidding war you set off when you click on a link with ads? If you decline to allow companies to sell your data, as CCPA allows Californians to do, that bidding happens without the bidders knowing as much about you, and the ad is less valuable. But Google has found a way to turn this to its advantage: When a user opts out,\u00a0Google does not allow other parties to bid at all, restricting it to its own, in-house bidders.<br/>Image credit: Trismegist san/Shutterstock<br/>And these laws are new enough that it's unclear how effectively they'll be enforced, and to what extent. Legislation can have unintended consequences, points out Ashutosh Bhagwat, a constitutional law professor at the University of California-Davis. Any policy that undermines the basic business model of an industry needs to offer an alternative unless we intend to live without social media altogether. (Not likely.) And paying for services rather than relying on advertising can accentuate the \"digital divide,\" denying social media to people around the world who can't afford it.<br/>\"I think the privacy concerns are somewhat legitimate, but I think they're a little overblown. There's a lot of, 'the sky is falling' kind of stuff going on, and I don't think we've quite got to that point yet. Maybe facial recognition will be the technology that's the killer app for privacy,\" says Bhagwat. \"People vastly exaggerate how easy it would be to solve this [privacy] problem.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>Although the current COVID-19 pandemic has dominated the media cycle, some of these issues are coming to a head behind the scenes as people work from home and spend more time online. Online meeting software Zoom was busted,\u00a0and then sued, for sending information - including device, operating software, carrier, time zone, IP address, and more - to Facebook without permission via the \"Login with Facebook\" SDK. (Zoom has since removed the SDK.)\u00a0<br/>Although the current COVID-19 pandemic has dominated the media cycle, some of these issues are coming to a head behind the scenes<br/>Meanwhile, governments around the world have been\u00a0using a variety of phone data\u00a0to track and combat the disease, including enforcing social distancing and mapping the spread. Many have raised concerns about sacrificing privacy during a crisis, only to never get it back, but the response in Taiwan, where the\u00a0government installed location trackers\u00a0on the phones of people suspected of having COVID, has been positive because policies there have been so effective at stopping the spread. Kinsa Health has been cheered for its ability to\u00a0quickly spot potential outbreaks\u00a0- sometimes weeks ahead of the CDC - based on the body temperatures of its users sent to the company by its smart thermometers.\u00a0<br/>Google has\u00a0launched a site\u00a0that offers community mobility reports, which uses location information to show public health officials (or anyone who wants to look) where people are and aren't going. Google says the information is\u00a0collected in aggregate\u00a0and won't show actual numbers, just percent change. Through it all, Congress has been moving forward with the\u00a0EARN IT Act, which would eliminate end-to-end encryption (as used in messaging apps like WhatsApp or Signal) in the name of fighting child exploitation.<br/>Still, some sort of privacy regulation is necessary, says the EFF's Stoltz. \"Broadly, they take the right approach to privacy, in that they start from a framework of privacy being a human right, not something that a person can sell or trade away,\" he says. \"We really do need both baseline privacy rules ... [and] robust antitrust law that says the concentration of economic power is harmful, just like concentrations of political power are harmful.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1342853</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KG-T8W1-JBYT-H0G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5025\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000D7EQ</classCode><className>SHUTTERSTOCK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

To pretty much no one\u2019s surprise, this got Fort nite booted from both app stores faster than being yeeted from the Battle Bus. Epic promptly responded by filing lawsuits against both Apple and Google , and the company also released a video mocking Apple for its practices and poking fun at the company\u2019s iconic 1984 commercial . It was clear from the jump that Epic came ready to brawl, and while Fortnite may have been the catalyst, the reckoning for Apple and Google\u2019s App Stores has been a long time coming.    Smartphones have overtaken laptops as our primary computing device, and with the death of Windows Mobile \u2014 the only potentially viable smartphone OS alternative \u2014 in 2017, it\u2019s fair to say that Android and iOS \u2014 and by extension Google and Apple \u2014 have an outsized influence on people\u2019s phone habits.    You can side-load apps on Android by installing them manually using an APK, or even create your own fork of Android that features a third-party store (moves that both Amazon and Huawei have attempted with varying degrees of success), but Google\u2019s Play Store remains the easiest and most trusted way of getting new Android apps.  Google charges a service fee of around 30 per cent for developers who want to be in the Play store.           Epic Games is Suing Apple After Removing Fortnite from the App Store    Everyone is mad about Apple\u2019s App Store guidelines right now, especially when it comes to cloud gaming services. Microsoft isn\u2019t bringing Project xCloud to iOS. Google\u2019s Stadia app can\u2019t let iPhone users actually play games. Facebook also had to axe the ability to play games for its Facebook Gaming iOS...   Read more     For people who use iOS, things are even more restrictive \u2014 Apple doesn\u2019t allow any third-party device makers to licence iOS for use on other phones, and because iOS doesn\u2019t allowing side-loading or manual installation of apps (aside from some niche developer-related cases), your only method of getting new apps to run on an iPhone is the App Store. It\u2019s a totally locked-down platform, with Apple charging a 30 per cent commission on any app sales, either up front or within the app itself.    For anyone who has ever purchased physical media (remember CDs and cassettes?) or people who grew up using PCs where installing executables from outside sources was the norm, the concept behind app stores can feel incredibly draconian. It\u2019s like buying a microwave that can only heat up food that came from a single grocer, which is a big reason why people can\u2019t stand coffee machines from companies like Keurig.    When it comes to Android, a lot of companies try to get around Google\u2019s restrictions by making APKs of their apps publicly available, and months before Fortnite ever showed up on Google Play, it was available to download directly from Epic and worked just fine \u2014 as long as you took the time to change some permissions. In its lawsuit against Google, Epic even claims that it negotiated a deal with OnePlus to have a special Fortnite launcher pre-installed on OnePlus devices, only to have Google force OnePlus to \u201crenege on the deal.\u201d    And on iOS, Epic claims \u201cabsent Apple\u2019s anti-competitive conduct, Epic Games would also create an app store for iOS.\u201d    I\u2019d be remiss not to mention that app stores do offer a lot of benefits to the user. You can buy an app once and download it again on any other Android or iOS device, you can automatically sync data, save profiles, and more. The problem is that there\u2019s little competition compelling Apple and Google to adjust their 30 per cent service fees, and with app stores rules that stipulate that any software that contains in-app purchases must comply with Apple and Google\u2019s guidelines, those rules are ironclad. If you sell an app, or offer items inside an app that came from one of the two big app stores, Apple and Google will take their cut, or else the app gets the boot.    The closest analogy to app stores outside of the mobile world are PC games stores like Steam, GOG, Battle.net, and others. For a long time, Steam was the premier game store, running uncontested for years. But over the last decade, multiple publishers and game devs (including Epic) have stepped up to create their own digital storefronts, which eventually led Steam to lower its service fees . While some people may complain about things being annoying now that Steam is no longer the home for every single game, it\u2019s a clear case of competition resulting in more revenue for game devs and lower prices for consumers.    But perhaps the bigger issue is when Apple and Google\u2019s own app store guidelines get applied in different degrees. According to emails shown to U.S. Congress during the recent tech antitrust hearing, Apple agreed to cut its typical 30 per cent service fees in half for a year in order to entice Amazon to put Prime Video in the App Store.    It\u2019s a similar situation when it comes to game streaming on iOS, where apps like Steam Link are allowed on the App Store but Microsoft was forced to cut short its cloud gaming xCloud beta (now called Xbox Game Pass Ultimate). Microsoft said that \u201cApple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass. And it consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps even when they include interactive content.\u201d    As evidenced by last month\u2019s big tech  antitrust hearing , the U.S. is starting to look more closely at Apple and Google\u2019s app stores. But in other countries, Apple is already under investigation by the EU over anti-competitive practices regarding music-streaming apps and the price of ebooks, while Google was hit with a record $US5 ($7) million fine in 2018 for antitrust due to Google\u2019s licensing terms for Android.    One potentially interesting note is that while Epic is suing both Apple and Google, it\u2019s not seeking monetary damages, and instead only hoping for both companies to end their \u201cmonopolistic practices.\u201d So while Epic\u2019s stunt with Fortnite might be the powder keg that started the war, concerns over the app store duopoly have been brewing for quite some time. It\u2019ll probably take even longer for regulators to figure what to do.    The post appeared first on Gizmodo Australia .

Late Thursday night, CNN published a report[1] that calls into question the effectiveness of YouTube's year-long efforts to remove material that advertisers found objectionable. Representatives for YouTube were not immediately available for comment. In March 2017, it was reported that ads from Fortune 500 companies were appearing on videos promoting hate speech, terrorism and wild conspiracy theories. </p><p>In response, YouTube began to rid the site of offensive and disturbing clips. That was supposed to be the end of the story\u2014 butCNN recently found ads on YouTube, paid for by more than 300 companies and government groups, that continue to run alongside unsavory fare. The cable news channel wrote that the videos included such themes as white nationalism, pedophilia, and North Korean propaganda. Some of the advertisers affected told CNN that they were pulling their ads until YouTube corrected these issues. But that's the big question now: Does YouTube have the ability to police the service? At minimum, can YouTube's managers create a safe haven for advertisers? If not, the situation could have big implications for Google's parent company Alphabet Inc., and its relationship with Wall Street. Google is considered a growth company but investors want to know where that growth will come from in the future. It's against this background that Alphabet will announce its latest quarterly earnings on Monday. Analysts expect Alphabet to report first-quarter earnings of $9.33 per share on revenue of $30.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.In search of something newFor some time, the financial world has wondered when one of Alphabet's promising side ventures might develop into another significant source of revenue. One day, even the revenue bonanza known as search advertising will top out, and Google will need something new to bring in the cash. YouTube is one of the top contenders. The iconic video-sharing service has emerged as one of the must-be places for advertisers seeking to reach the site's gargantuan teen and young-adult audience. \"We continue to believe YouTube is the major growth driver on the ad front,\" wrote Daniel Ives, head of tech research at market research firm GBH Insights. \"This dominant platform now has north of 1.5 billion users watching on average 60 minutes per day.\" Since Alphabet doesn't break out YouTube's financial numbers, nobody outside the company knows for sure how much money the video site makes. What we do know is that scaring away large advertisers is unlikely to help.The regulation factorRegulators around the world are also wary of the effects that big digital networks are having on society. If YouTube can't sponge the site clean of pedophiles and terrorists, how long will it be before YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki is forced to follow Mark Zuckerberg to Capitol Hill? And that's not the end of the bad news. Google, Facebook, and other big tech companies face big regulatory scrutiny in Europe on a range of issues.  One of YouTube's problems there began in 2015 when the European Commission concluded that the financial relationship between content creators and services such as YouTube was too one sided. The unit of the European Union that proposes legislation and enacts them if they become law, said copyright rules need to be \"modernized\" so creators can negotiate better deals [2]with YouTube-esque platforms. Since then, the commission has tried to get proposals passed that ensures YouTube pays more to creators. At the same time, some analysts believe music may be more important to YouTube than ever. \"Google is just starting to tap the potential in YouTube,\" wrote Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, on his blog[3]. \" And if it is able to position it as a competitor to Spotify in music streaming and Netflix in video streaming, it could discover a new source of revenue growth with strong operating margins.\" YouTube's longer-term prospects appear to be much rosier. The service has no significant competitors while continuing to add viewers. And Facebook has shown, these regulatory hassles don't seem to drag a stock price down for very long. On March 16, Facebook's stock was trading at $185 and then plummeted on March 28, during the Cambridge Analytica scandal to $153. But the share price has already begun to recover. On Friday, the stock closed at $166.

Here's where the regulator will focus in 2020: The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its work programme for 2020[1]. The FSB's work priorities for 2020 reflect the evolving nature of the global financial system and associated risks to financial stability. The FSB will reinforce its forward-looking monitoring of developments to identify, assess and address new and emerging vulnerabilities. At the same time, the FSB will continue its work to finalise and operationalise the remaining elements of post-crisis reforms; monitor and assess the implementation of reforms; and evaluate their effects in order to ensure that reforms work as intended. </p><p>Important specific FSB work programme items, which include key deliverables to the G20 Saudi Arabian Presidency, are: FinTech. The FSB will continue to monitor financial innovation developments and assess their potential implications for financial stability. Complementing the recent report on BigTech in finance, the FSB will report on the perspective of emerging market and developing economies on this topic. The FSB will also take stock of the range of practices on the use of RegTech and SupTech. Global stablecoins. The introduction of so-called global 'stablecoins' could pose a host of challenges to the regulatory community, including for financial stability. At the same time, it could bring benefits to the final system and wider economy. The FSB will issue a public consultation on addressing regulatory issues of stablecoins in April. Cross-border payment systems. Payment systems are a central pillar of the global financial system and economy. Digital innovation could improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of cross-border payment services, which are often considered to be slow and costly. In coordination with the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and other relevant international organisations and standard-setting bodies, the FSB will develop and deliver to the G20 a roadmap for how to enhance global cross-border payments. Interest rate benchmarks. Continued reliance of global financial markets on LIBOR poses risks to financial stability. Transition away from LIBOR by end-2021 requires significant commitment and sustained effort from both financial and non-financial firms across many jurisdictions. To improve understanding and increase awareness of the importance of ensuring timely transition, the FSB will take stock of the implementation of benchmark reforms and report on remaining challenges to benchmark transition.. Ongoing evaluation work. The FSB will take forward its multi-year programme for evaluating the effects of reforms under its Evaluation Framework. In 2020, this includes the completion of an evaluation of the effects of TBTF reforms for banks and the launch of an evaluation of the effects of money market fund reforms. Speaking of the FSB, did you see their take on Big Tech moving into banking[2]? No? Well, here's a quick summation of that too: BigTech firms - large companies with established technology platforms - are playing an increasingly prominent role in the financial system and have begun to provide financial services. Some BigTech firms have grown rapidly in the past decade and, on some measures, are comparable in size or even bigger than some of the world's largest financial institutions. BigTech firms benefit from having large existing customer bases and from collecting and analysing their customers' data. They can use this to achieve scale rapidly across different business lines, including in financial services. They also tend to have significant financial resources and are often able to access capital and funding at lower cost than some large financial groups. BigTech firms differ in both the breadth of financial services they offer and in the nature of their interaction with incumbent financial institutions. In advanced economies (AEs), BigTech firms' financial activities are generally more narrow (e.g. focussed on payments), and tend to complement the activities of existing financial institutions. In emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), BigTech firms provide a broader range of financial services such as lending, insurance and asset management. This variation may be due to differences in financial development, approaches to financial regulation, and the penetration of financial services across different geographies. Various modes of interaction are emerging between BigTech firms and financial institutions. Some involve partnerships, for example where BigTech firms provide technology infrastructure to financial institutions. In some markets, BigTech firms also compete directly with existing financial firms. The overall response of incumbent financial institutions to BigTech firms' entry in financial services and its effect on their business models is likely to vary across institutions and markets. The activities of BigTech firms in the financial services sector have numerous benefits. These include the potential for innovation, diversification and efficiency in the provision of financial services. BigTech firms can also contribute to financial inclusion, particularly in EMDEs where they have the potential to increase access to financial services by previously unbanked populations. BigTech firms may also improve financial inclusion and facilitate access to markets that were previously untapped, a particularly important benefit for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) competing with incumbents in financial services. The third-party services offered by BigTech firms also may provide access to technologies like artificial intelligence and data analytics capabilities previously unavailable to the wider marketplace. BigTech firms' activities may also pose risks to financial stability. Some risks are similar to those from financial firms more broadly (including FinTech firms), and have been the subject of previous work by the FSB.2 These include financial risks that stem from leverage, maturity transformation and liquidity mismatches, as well as operational risks including those that might arise from potential shortcomings in governance, risk and process controls. BigTech firms engaging in financial services may also pose risks to financial stability that are different to, or more prominent than, those from FinTech firms more generally. These risks to financial stability might be greater in countries where BigTech firms become significant providers of financial services. Such risks are, by their nature, uncertain and forward looking, given that BigTechs' provision of financial services is relatively nascent in most jurisdictions. Some potential risks stem from how BigTech firms could use their network and infrastructure to achieve scale in financial services very rapidly. Competition from BigTech firms might reduce the resilience of financial institutions, either by affecting their profitability or by reducing the stability of their funding. BigTech firms' widespread access to valuable customer data could also be self-reinforcing via network effects. The scale and complexity of linkages between BigTech and financial firms could also act as channels for the propagation of risk. Such linkages arise from financial institutions' dependence on third-party services provided by some BigTech firms. Other linkages arise through BigTech firms' partnerships with financial institutions to originate and/or distribute financial products. These risks may be particularly significant if such financial services are not readily substitutable, and if BigTech firms' risk management and controls are less effective than those required of regulated financial institutions. A further overarching consideration is that a small number of BigTech firms may in the future come to dominate, rather than diversify, the provision of certain financial services in some jurisdictions. If this were to occur, the failure of these firms could lead to widespread disruption. In particular, this might be a risk if BigTech firms' activities in financial services were not accompanied by appropriate risk management and regulatory monitoring, or if BigTech firms' customers were not able to readily switch to other providers of financial services. These developments raise a range of issues for policymakers. The activities of BigTech firms in financial services may be subject to regulation in most jurisdictions. There is a question, however, of whether additional regulation and/or financial oversight may be warranted. Regulators and supervisors might also be mindful of the degree to which the resilience of incumbent financial institutions and the viability of their business models might be affected by their interlinkages with and competition from BigTech firms. Finally, BigTech firms' ability to leverage wide-ranging customer data raises considerations for authorities regarding policies governing data ownership, access and portability.

Mercatus utilizes research and analysis to argue for a private solution to occupational licensing.  \"Does Regulation Breed Financial Illiteracy?\"</p><p>  Cato's Diego Zuluaga contends regulation is a significant factor behind average citizens knowing very little about how to invest and manage their personal finances.  \"Candy-Coated Cartel: Time to Kill the U.S. Sugar Program\"  The US Sugar Program is an ongoing example of restrictive USDA and Department of Commerce policy, benefiting a small, but active, lobby while increasing the price of sugar in the US. The Cato Institute details the crony capitalism surrounding the Sugar Program, arguing for abolition of the anti-consumer, pro-lobbyist regulations.  \"When did making customers happy become a reason for regulation or breakup?\"  The AEI argues against regulations on social media outlets, focusing on consumer choice in the market, instead of government interference.  \"Here We Go Again: Steel and Aluminum Tariffs and Peter Navarro\"  The CEI published this article last week discussing recent trade regulations passed by the Trump Administration. Along with giving an overview of the impacts of the new tariffs, Ryan Young analyzes and debunks the arguments of Peter Navarro, the President's chief apologist for protectionist trade policy.  \"Mick Mulvaney Right To Rein In CFPB\"  Over the past decade, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency of the US government, has vastly expanded its regulatory reach and cost to taxpayers. Jamey Bowers reports on Mick Mulvaney's commitment to lessening the regulatory power of the CFPB while simultaneously placing it under Congressional authority.  \"Be Grateful for 'Big Tech'\"  As the influence and size of major tech companies grows, some critics have labeled companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon as monopolistic and out of control. While the major tech companies are significant in market size, Robert D. Atkinson argues against demonizing Big Tech's hold on the market to the point of government regulation. Instead, Atkinson points to the ability of companies to compete in the market through innovation as proof of the private sector's ability to regulate itself.

But comparing the pace of progress in the two locales, they may as well be in different solar systems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. The post-crisis law created a consumer protection regulator, eliminated a thrift regulator, empowered the Fed to tighten its supervision of big banks, and launched a committee of regulators to combat systemic risks, among other changes. Against the history of bank policymaking, Dodd-Frank was a big deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet it was hardly a tremor next to the tectonic movements in digital technology. In 2010, bitcoin and Venmo were in their infancies and Apple's cellphone market share trailed Nokia's. 2020 is like a new century in tech development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With policymaking moving at an agonizingly slow speed compared with the exponential growth of technology, regulators and lawmakers face a huge task heading into a new decade. By 2025, despite efforts to close the gap, policymaking could fall even further behind. Given the goals of tech giants like Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook to get deeper into financial services, the tension between those who want to innovate banking faster and a regulatory system designed in many ways to slow change will only intensify.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest puzzle for regulation to solve is the intersection of big tech and financial services. \"Financial services are regulated as a sector. Now you see Google and Amazon - these big-tech, commercial entities - starting to blur that line,\" said Kelly Cochran, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who is now the deputy director of FinRegLab. \"Does the financial sector stay distinct? Does financial data stay distinct? If so, how does that happen when all this line-blurring is going on? I'm not exactly sure how it will play out. But I strongly suspect that's going to be the central question over the next five years.\"</p><p>What will regulators do?</p><p>A broad regulatory reform push to address fintech appears unlikely by 2025. Instead, observers see piecemeal changes perhaps in response to singular market developments or crises, while agencies will continue to digitize the regulatory process and streamline their assessment of banks' fintech solutions.</p><p>\"We'll certainly have organic change. We might have crisis-driven change. But I think what actually is going to happen and is needed is something in the middle,\" said Jo Ann Barefoot, a former regulator and congressional staffer who heads the Alliance for Innovative Regulation. \"That is, not structural change in the sense of creating a new Department of Financial Technology Oversight ... but rather new modes of working by the regulators.\"</p><p>With the past five years as a guide, there is little doubt that the steady advance of digital technology, automation and artificial intelligence over the next five years will further reshape how consumers handle their money. Data-focused tech companies will continue to venture into financial services, redefining what it means to be a bank and obscuring the lines between financial and commercial companies.</p><p>That evolution is certain to set off policy debates over new proposed charter types, regulatory frameworks and activity restrictions. The growing dominance of data in financial services will lead regulators and lawmakers to zero in on who owns that data, how to protect consumers' privacy and the risk of criminals using financial technology to launder money.</p><p>But despite such a rapid transformation in the financial services sector, policy experts doubt Congress will pass comprehensive regulatory reform to keep pace.</p><p>\"It's very unlikely that there will be this 'aha' moment - a Big Bang or sweeping change in policy towards financial technology,\" said Michael Barr, the dean of the University of Michigan's Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy and a former Obama Treasury Department official.</p><p>Policymakers will instead respond in more discrete ways.</p><p>\"It's much more likely that you'll see a series of interventions, maybe around many mini-crises, or maybe around many mini-possibilities for innovation or mini-realizations about important areas,\" Barr said.</p><p>Incremental change has limitations</p><p>Many have been encouraged by the progress of agencies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the CFPB to build in-house units focused on innovation.</p><p>There appears to be a sincere desire among regulators to understand both digital products offered by banks and new compliance tools, as well as utilize their own data-focused tools to make regulatory oversight more efficient.</p><p>Examples include the OCC's work to develop a specialized fintech charter, although the charter has hit legal roadblocks. The CFPB has advanced vehicles to give fintech startups running room to test products without the looming threat of an enforcement action. FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams, meanwhile, has been credited with bringing a new innovation-focused attitude to her agency, illustrated by her participation in a recent transatlantic \"tech sprint\" - in which teams demonstrated new anti-money-laundering tools - co-hosted by the Financial Conduct Authority.</p><p>\"Candidly, the FDIC was probably the most cautious of the regulators a few years back,\" said Barefoot, whose alliance helped put on the tech sprint. And now McWilliams \"has set a goal - these are her words - of transforming how they supervise banks during her term, which has three and a half years left, and doing it in a way that will survive long after she's gone. ... Increasingly, we are seeing bold leadership.\"</p><p>Adrienne Harris, who was a special assistant to President Barack Obama at the National Economic Council, said officials have to thread the needle of protecting the financial system from mishaps while still cultivating innovation.</p><p>\"From the innovation offices to other types of engagement that we're seeing from policymakers, a lot of this will continue to develop organically as all the stakeholders are trying to find the right balance between mitigating risk and making sure the market's able to seize opportunity responsibly,\" said Harris, a policymaker-in-residence and Gates Foundation senior fellow at the University of Michigan.</p><p>But an incremental, organic approach to setting federal policy for the profound technological change in the financial services sector has limitations. Analysts say a better scenario is for the legislative and executive branches to develop a more comprehensive framework to enable innovation while safeguarding the system from new risks.</p><p>\"If we had sufficient political attention and will, not just in the Congress, but in the regulatory agencies, to get together in a concerted way, we'd be much better off as a country - if we pushed forward aggressively to have an innovation policy on fintech that balanced all these issues, that took care of consumers, that was pro-innovation,\" Barr said. \"As a predictive matter, how likely is that? I don't think very likely.\"</p><p>The line between financial, nonfinancial regulation</p><p>A structural policy already in play that appears likely to grow more complicated in the next five years is the blurring of lines between banks, other types of financial companies and commercial firms.</p><p>The aim of tech giants such as Google and Facebook to be more involved with consumers' money highlights the emphasis on consumer data as a commodity. But that leads to questions about who regulates the use of data across different sectors, who owns the data and how portable it should be. Meanwhile, longstanding efforts to pass legislation strengthening data security and privacy have yet to succeed.</p><p>A future policy debate could revolve around whether an existing agency such as the CFPB or the Federal Trade Commission is given new powers to oversee the use of consumer data for financial purposes, or whether Congress creates a new agency for that purpose. \"One of the advantages to the Federal Trade Commission structure right now is that it has both competition and consumer protection within the same agency,\" Cochran said. \"There are some real advantages when it comes to data issues to having both of those lenses being used at the same time.\"</p><p>Factors such as a massive data breach or concerns about the reach of a private-sector cryptocurrency could force Congress to finally enact strong cybersecurity standards or take steps to protect consumers' privacy.</p><p>Amy Friend, a former staffer on the Senate Banking Committee and former general counsel at the OCC, recalled how - even before the debate over Dodd-Frank - the financial crisis spurred lawmakers to pass a sweeping credit card reform bill in 2009. At the time she worked for then-Chairman Chris Dodd, D-Conn.</p><p>\"What enabled the CARD Act to move forward was lawmakers, particularly the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, saw the opportunity during the financial crisis, when the banks really couldn't muster the lobbying force to lobby against it,\" said Friend, referring to the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act.</p><p>Areas such as privacy and data portability are \"ripe for legislation,\" said Friend, now a senior adviser at FS Vector. \"Privacy is something that Congress has been trying to do for many, many years, even before where we are right now with more intrusive technology.\"</p><p>Contributing to a more innovative future</p><p>With regulators setting out to be more innovation-focused, a variety of nongovernmental groups are trying to aid the process, conducting projects that look at the future of financial policy for both the policymakers and financial services companies.</p><p>Harris and Barr are involved with the University of Michigan's Center on Finance, Law and Policy, which is studying issues like the future of central banks and small-business consumer protections tied to fintech.</p><p>The center's project on central banks deals with how they might evolve so that financial inclusion becomes a core part of their mission.</p><p>\"Part of our task is to think about technology that those institutions could leverage in the 'regtech' or 'suptech' arenas, ways they might change their processes, how they might even change their explicit mandate such that they would be in a position to better promote and foster financial inclusion around the world,\" Harris said.</p><p>Barefoot's group is developing what she called a \"regtech manifesto\" on steps to make the regulatory system more innovative, as well as a legal memo in concert with the Buckley law firm on the statutory impediments for regulators to incorporate more tech-focused tools.</p><p>\"We have to get the information in the regulatory system into digital form so that we can see it. The information that we use to oversee banks ... is mostly locked up. It's opaque,\" she said. \"They need smarter data. They have to become data-centric. I'm optimistic that there is fast-developing interest in this.\"</p><p>FinRegLab, meanwhile, has conducted a project focused on the predictive power of cash-flow data - versus more traditional factors such as credit scores - in the underwriting process. \"If you adjust underwriting models to incorporate new information, what are all the issues that come along with that adjustment? If you can figure that out in the cash-flow space, that might be very useful,\" Cochran said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USBANK-226584-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USBANK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWN-GJ31-F06X-W3PC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8066</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1878\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

The words have, of late, taken on new meaning. After years during which tech's titans could do no wrong, they are now being pulled into a vortex of regulatory woes that make headlines almost daily. Big Tech is not about to implode. But will it come out intact? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest burst of antitrust activity came on July 24th, when Facebook said that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an American regulatory agency, had launched an investigation into the company. The news came soon after the FTC released details of a much-anticipated privacy settlement with the firm. </p><p>The social network will pay a $5bn fine for violating a previous privacy deal with the FTC. But Facebook also agreed to formalise its privacy processes, for instance by creating a special committee on its board and by designating compliance officers. Its boss, Mark Zuckerberg, will also have to certify the firm's compliance\u2014which could make him personally liable should Facebook fail to get its act together.</p><p>A day earlier, America's Department of Justice announced that it would look into how big online platforms have achieved market power and whether they abuse it. The DoJ did not say which firms it had in mind, but Google is likely to be one. The department's lawyers are reportedly already preparing to investigate it. </p><p>Trustbusters on the other side of the Atlantic\u2014who have already fined Google more than ?8.2bn ($9.3bn) in recent years\u2014are not resting on their laurels. On July 17th Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition regulator, announced that her department had opened an investigation into whether Amazon uses the data it collects from merchants' sales on its sites to push its own products. Insiders expect the EU's next target will be Apple, which stands accused of using its control of the app store on its iPhones to favour its own services, mainly Apple Music.</p><p>All this suggests that the tech titans are in trouble both in Europe and America. Some Democrats hoping to run for the presidency have called for their break-up. William Barr, a lawyer for media and telecoms firms who became attorney-general in February, has spent years fighting them. At his confirmation hearings he agreed with a senator who said that \"dominant Silicon Valley firms could use their market power...to discriminate against rival products, services or viewpoints.\"</p><p>This last point in particular worries Republicans. They view these giants as liberal bastions, which will discriminate against right-wing views in efforts to rid their platforms of extreme and hateful content. This month President Donald Trump held a \"Social Media Summit\" where right-wing bloggers aired their grievances. In a sign of how far critics will go, Peter Thiel, a successful tech investor and sometime defender of Mr Trump, recently speculated that Google had been \"infiltrated\" by Chinese intelligence services (despite a Trump tweet promising to \"take a look\", his administration later dismissed the idea).</p><p>Whether these are just acts of intimidation ahead of presidential elections next year remains to be seen. If Facebook's settlement with the FTC is any guide, Big Tech could still emerge mostly unscathed. The large fine and its new privacy bureaucracy notwithstanding, Facebook does not have to change its data-collection practices and is off the hook for any more claims that it violated the previous FTC settlement.</p><p>In a twist, Microsoft, the world's most valuable listed firm, with a market capitalisation of over $1trn, has hardly been touched by the techlash. It has learned hard lessons from going through the regulatory wringer at the turn of the century: look beyond the cash cow (Windows); rapaciousness ultimately does not pay; and work with regulators. Another Hemingway quote is less well-known among geeks: \"The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-NQ83HT2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN7-35V1-DY2R-202F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Other companies should follow suit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally, I figured it out: It's a feature, not a bug.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That old Silicon Valley bromide was at the center of the finale this week of HBO's satire \"Silicon Valley,\" the show that has perfectly and hysterically skewered tech and all its weirdness for six seasons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Silicon Valley\" - from executive producers Mike Judge and Alec Berg - was always prescient and topical, but the last episode, \"Exit Event,\" nailed the most important point that the series and its motley crew of geeks has made throughout its run. It's a point that explains a lot about where we are today with tech: You can't build a safe internet, even when you try your hardest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The punch line of the series was the perfect metaphor for today's real-life digital landscape: A groundbreaking artificial-intelligence platform called Pied Piper (the actual product is called PiperNet) had become potentially dangerous and rats got activated to destroy the creation. (I should mention that I've made guest appearances on the show, playing myself.)</p><p>So if you want to know why so much of tech has seemed to become ever scarier - whether you read the report out last week from Uber about sexual assaults taking place across its car-hailing business, or the multipart series in The New York Times on how services like gaming or video platforms have become hunting grounds for pedophiles, or listened to numerous Republican politicians spew propaganda online about Ukraine meddling in American elections - let me break it down for you.</p><p>Simply put, far too many of the people who have designed the wondrous parts of the internet - thinking up cool new products to make our lives easier, distributing them across the globe and making fortunes doing so - have never felt unsafe a day in their lives.</p><p>They've never felt a twinge of fear getting into a stranger's car. They've never imagined the pain of privacy violations, because rarely have they been hacked or swatted or doxed. They've not been stalked or attacked or zeroed out because of their gender, race or sexual orientation. They've never had to think about the consequences of bad choices, because there have been almost no consequences of failure. They have never worried about losing their high-level status, living lives defined by the line on their company growth charts: \"up and to the right.\"</p><p>Literally, up and to the right. Despite all the mishegas over everything from election interference to hate speech to disinformation to screen addiction to President Trump's toxic tweets, after a tough 2018, tech shares in the S&amp;amp;P 500 are up more than 40 percent as 2019 comes to a close, way above the overall index.</p><p>Amazon is up 16 percent. Alphabet has soared close to 29 percent. Microsoft is zeroing in on a 50 percent gain, while Apple is killing it at 70 percent. And Facebook, the social networking giant that has attracted the ire of so many for so much? Up 53 percent.</p><p>Big tech includes the most valuable companies on the planet, with two in the trillion-dollar valuation club (Apple and Microsoft), one coming close (Amazon) and another closer (Alphabet).</p><p>Which is why I found it striking and laudable that it was Uber - whose shares have plummeted since its I.P.O. in May - that was out front as the year ends by delivering on its promise to publicly reveal all of the unsafe incidents on its platform.</p><p>The report the company delivered last week noted that it had more than 3,000 incidents of sexual assault of varying degrees in 2018, a small number compared to the overall ride volume, even though that's a higher number than reported on other transportation systems.</p><p>Among the problems were shoddy background checks. How well - or not - the company vetted its drivers has been a long-running problem that its more recently appointed managers have been trying to fix.</p><p>\"The numbers are jarring and hard to digest,\" said Uber's chief legal officer, Tony West, in an interview last week in The New York Times. \"What it says is that Uber is a reflection of the society it serves.\"</p><p>While Mr. West has a point - humans often do act like beasts - it's one that tech companies often rely on as a go-to explanation for misdeeds. When things go wrong, executives often point to the cruel world and say that they cannot control how their inventions are used by the teeming masses and the inevitable malevolents. Also often pointed out: The bad acting is just a tiny sliver of the massive use of their products.</p><p>All true, but that's actually the bug, not the feature. The real problem, which was perfectly depicted on \"Silicon Valley,\" is that thoughtlessness <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is</emphasis> a feature, lack of reflection <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is</emphasis> a feature, a drive to grow at all costs <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is</emphasis> a feature and, most of all, the sloppy and lazy ways in which tech too often designs and deploys its inventions <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">are</emphasis> the ultimate features.</p><p>Uber had been the poster child for this, of course, with its go-go-damn-the-torpedoes ethos under the co-founder and former chief executive Travis Kalanick. While creating a product that hit the bull's-eye of a market need, it did so by flouting regulations meant to protect customers, like doing those pesky background checks and crowing about how you had to drive fast to win big.</p><p>Even now, Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi - who replaced Mr. Kalanick after he was ousted for hit-and-running over a lot of stuff - is still cleaning up the mess and trying to put in place safety features that should have been there in the first place. He's had to awkwardly bolt them on, of course, because the idea of thinking of safety first has never been at the heart of anything Uber or most of Silicon Valley does.</p><p>So, kudos to Uber for at least putting a mirror to the ugly parts of its face and not looking away. Like all of tech - whether it is around issues of privacy, disinformation, hate speech, screen addiction or the abuse of children online - the company probably should have thought of it at the beginning, rather than after damage was done.</p><p>\"There is no law, regulation or lawsuit that is forcing Uber to make this data available,\" Mr. West said to The Times. \"We are doing this, frankly, because the public has a right to know.\"</p><p>The truth is, we always did.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

Other companies should follow suit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally, I figured it out: It\u2019s a feature, not a bug.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That old Silicon Valley bromide was at the center of the finale this week of HBO\u2019s satire \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d the show that has perfectly and hysterically skewered tech and all its weirdness for six seasons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley\">Silicon Valley</url>\u201d \u2014 from executive producers Mike Judge and Alec Berg \u2014 was always prescient and topical, but the last episode, \u201cExit Event,\u201d nailed the most important point that the series and its motley crew of geeks has made throughout its run. It\u2019s a point that explains a lot about where we are today with tech: You can\u2019t build a safe internet, even when you try your hardest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The punch line of the series was the perfect metaphor for today\u2019s real-life digital landscape: A groundbreaking artificial-intelligence platform called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley\">Pied Piper</url> (the actual product is called PiperNet) had become potentially dangerous and rats got activated to destroy the creation. (I should mention that I\u2019ve made guest appearances on the show, playing myself.)</p><p>So if you want to know why so much of tech has seemed to become ever scarier \u2014 whether you read the report out last week from Uber about sexual assaults taking place across its car-hailing business, or the multipart series in The New York Times on how services like gaming or video platforms have become hunting grounds for pedophiles, or listened to numerous Republican politicians spew propaganda online about Ukraine meddling in American elections \u2014 let me break it down for you.</p><p>Simply put, far too many of the people who have designed the wondrous parts of the internet \u2014 thinking up cool new products to make our lives easier, distributing them across the globe and making fortunes doing so \u2014 have never felt unsafe a day in their lives.</p><p>They\u2019ve never felt a twinge of fear getting into a stranger\u2019s car. They\u2019ve never imagined the pain of privacy violations, because rarely have they been hacked or swatted or doxed. They\u2019ve not been stalked or attacked or zeroed out because of their gender, race or sexual orientation. They\u2019ve never had to think about the consequences of bad choices, because there have been almost no consequences of failure. They have never worried about losing their high-level status, living lives defined by the line on their company growth charts: \u201cup and to the right.\u201d</p><p>Literally, up and to the right. Despite all the mishegas over everything from election interference to hate speech to disinformation to screen addiction to President Trump\u2019s toxic tweets, after a tough 2018, tech shares in the S&amp;amp;P 500 are up more than 40 percent as 2019 comes to a close, way above the overall index.</p><p>Amazon is up 16 percent. Alphabet has soared close to 29 percent. Microsoft is zeroing in on a 50 percent gain, while Apple is killing it at 70 percent. And Facebook, the social networking giant that has attracted the ire of so many for so much? Up 53 percent.</p><p>Big tech includes the most valuable companies on the planet, with two in the trillion-dollar valuation club (Apple and Microsoft), one coming close (Amazon) and another closer (Alphabet).</p><p>Which is why I found it striking and laudable that it was Uber \u2014 whose shares have plummeted since its I.P.O. in May \u2014 that was out front as the year ends by delivering on its promise to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley\">publicly reveal</url> all of the unsafe incidents on its platform.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley\">report</url> the company delivered last week noted that it had more than 3,000 incidents of sexual assault of varying degrees in 2018, a small number compared to the overall ride volume, even though that\u2019s a higher number than reported on other transportation systems.</p><p>Among the problems were shoddy background checks. How well \u2014 or not \u2014 the company vetted its drivers has been a long-running problem that its more recently appointed managers have been trying to fix.</p><p>\u201cThe numbers are jarring and hard to digest,\u201d said Uber\u2019s chief legal officer, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley\">Tony West</url>, in an interview last week in The New York Times. \u201cWhat it says is that Uber is a reflection of the society it serves.\u201d</p><p>While Mr. West has a point \u2014 humans often do act like beasts \u2014 it\u2019s one that tech companies often rely on as a go-to explanation for misdeeds. When things go wrong, executives often point to the cruel world and say that they cannot control how their inventions are used by the teeming masses and the inevitable malevolents. Also often pointed out: The bad acting is just a tiny sliver of the massive use of their products.</p><p>All true, but that\u2019s actually the bug, not the feature. The real problem, which was perfectly depicted on \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d is that thoughtlessness is a feature, lack of reflection is a feature, a drive to grow at all costs is a feature and, most of all, the sloppy and lazy ways in which tech too often designs and deploys its inventions are the ultimate features.</p><p>Uber had been the poster child for this, of course, with its go-go-damn-the-torpedoes ethos under the co-founder and former chief executive Travis Kalanick. While creating a product that hit the bull\u2019s-eye of a market need, it did so by flouting regulations meant to protect customers, like doing those pesky background checks and crowing about how you had to drive fast to win big.</p><p>Even now, Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi \u2014 who replaced Mr. Kalanick after he was ousted for hit-and-running over a lot of stuff \u2014 is still cleaning up the mess and trying to put in place safety features that should have been there in the first place. He\u2019s had to awkwardly bolt them on, of course, because the idea of thinking of safety first has never been at the heart of anything Uber or most of Silicon Valley does.</p><p>So, kudos to Uber for at least putting a mirror to the ugly parts of its face and not looking away. Like all of tech \u2014 whether it is around issues of privacy, disinformation, hate speech, screen addiction or the abuse of children online \u2014 the company probably should have thought of it at the beginning, rather than after damage was done.</p><p>\u201cThere is no law, regulation or lawsuit that is forcing Uber to make this data available,\u201d Mr. West said to The Times. \u201cWe are doing this, frankly, because the public has a right to know.\u201d</p><p>The truth is, we always did.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

He asked how many were on Facebook. One hand went up. The rest regarded Facebook as some ridiculous and intrusive thing their parents did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They see it,\" he tells me, \"as the platform of their parents and grandparents. They are horrified by how they post photos of their vacations with them in them. They see this as an absurd, indiscriminate posting of life.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The catch is that the kids were all on WhatsApp and Instagram, both owned by Facebook. Even so, on top of the leaks of user data, the political meddling, the cackhanded cover-up and, last week, the immensely damaging email cache published by British MPs, the news that the kids find this social medium desperately uncool is one more reputational horror Facebook could do without. Nobody actually likes this company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Whenever there's something especially creepy,\" says Eggers, \"or especially duplicitous, it seems to come from Facebook. There's something culturally wrong at Facebook.\"</p><p>We've come to expect tone deafness from the Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, but now Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer, has been embarrassingly implicated in the creation of this culture. She was a hero of women in the workplace, the founder of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.LeanIn.org\">www.LeanIn.org</url>, which offers women \"ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals\". But the revelations about Facebook's attempts to cover up its part in Russian meddling in the 2016 American presidential election revealed she was a key player, an active participant in attempts to smear the company's critics.</p><p>As if that weren't bad enough for Sandberg, she has now been attacked even by the sainted Michelle Obama.</p><p>\"That whole 'so you can have it all'. Nope, not at the same time,\" Obama said. \"That's a lie. And it's not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn't work all the time.\"</p><p>The emails released by MPs may prove the most serious threat of all to the company. They show a deliberate crushing of competitors - possibly opening a route to an unfaircompetition action - even more ruthless harvesting of users' data and the sale of it to selected companies and covert trawling for information about competitors. The charge list is long and getting longer.</p><p>Nothing, in the circumstances, could be more topical than the talk Eggers is to give for this year's PEN HG Wells lecture in London. He is to speak on digital human rights: it is 70 years since the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was a development of Wells's 1940 essay The Rights of Man.</p><p>Others have made statements of digital human rights - notably Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web, and Stefano Quintarelli, an Italian politician and IT expert - but they talk about rights when you're already online. Eggers wants something more.</p><p>\"What I want to add is that as a society we really have to reverse or slow down what seems to be a headlong move toward every aspect of our lives, from social to civil to political, having to be conducted in the digital world. An essential human right should be that we should be able to participate as citizens without having to do so in the digital world. There should always be an analogue option.\"</p><p>This strikes me as brilliant - digital rights would not be rights at all if they did not include a right to be non-digital, a status that, as the damning evidence piles up, may well become widely desired.</p><p>Eggers has been lecturing about online evils since 2013, when his novel The Circle was published, a Brave New World or Nineteen Eighty-Four for millennials and snowflakes. The Circle is a tech company, a combination of Facebook and Google, with dreams of world domination. It would achieve this primarily by eliminating privacy. Everybody ends up watching everybody else all the time, except during threeminute \"bathroom breaks\". The book was partly inspired by something Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, said: \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\" So Silicon Valley claims moral authority over us all.</p><p>\"Schmidt has said some of the most concerning things - they gave me a real chill. You feel privacy is only for deviants.\"</p><p>Will any of the big companies co-operate in this attempt to make them decent organisations? Google and Facebook have signed up to new internet standards designed by Berners-Lee that require companies to respect data privacy. But does that mean anything? \"I always thought that at least some of the major tech companies would accept some kind of regulatory framework if it were based on a commonsense understanding of morality, decency and democracy.\"</p><p>This is naive, Eggers now admits, because there is a \"profound lack of humility\" in Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"It's one of the foundational problems with these companies. They walk in the door with the sense that they are the centre of the universe and the smartest people on the planet and their company is the most influential of all time.</p><p>\"That can lead to some terrible outcomes.

He asked how many were on Facebook. One hand went up. The rest regarded Facebook as some ridiculous and intrusive thing their parents did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They see it,\" he tells me, \"as the platform of their parents and grandparents. They are horrified by how they post photos of their vacations with them in them. They see this as an absurd, indiscriminate posting of life.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The catch is that the kids were all on WhatsApp and Instagram, both owned by Facebook. Even so, on top of the leaks of user data, the political meddling, the cackhanded cover-up and, last week, the immensely damaging email cache published by British MPs, the news that the kids find this social medium desperately uncool is one more reputational horror Facebook could do without. Nobody actually likes this company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Whenever there's something especially creepy,\" says Eggers, \"or especially duplicitous, it seems to come from Facebook. There's something culturally wrong at Facebook.\"</p><p>We've come to expect tone deafness from the Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, but now Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer, has been embarrassingly implicated in the creation of this culture. She was a hero of women in the workplace, the founder of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.LeanIn.org\">www.LeanIn.org</url>, which offers women \"ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals\". But the revelations about Facebook's attempts to cover up its part in Russian meddling in the 2016 American presidential election revealed she was a key player, an active participant in attempts to smear the company's critics.</p><p>As if that weren't bad enough for Sandberg, she has now been attacked even by the sainted Michelle Obama.</p><p>\"That whole 'so you can have it all'. Nope, not at the same time,\" Obama said. \"That's a lie. And it's not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn't work all the time.\"</p><p>The emails released by MPs may prove the most serious threat of all to the company. They show a deliberate crushing of competitors - possibly opening a route to an unfaircompetition action - even more ruthless harvesting of users' data and the sale of it to selected companies and covert trawling for information about competitors. The charge list is long and getting longer.</p><p>Nothing, in the circumstances, could be more topical than the talk Eggers is to give for this year's PEN HG Wells lecture in London. He is to speak on digital human rights: it is 70 years since the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was a development of Wells's 1940 essay The Rights of Man.</p><p>Others have made statements of digital human rights - notably Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web, and Stefano Quintarelli, an Italian politician and IT expert - but they talk about rights when you're already online. Eggers wants something more.</p><p>\"What I want to add is that as a society we really have to reverse or slow down what seems to be a headlong move toward every aspect of our lives, from social to civil to political, having to be conducted in the digital world. An essential human right should be that we should be able to participate as citizens without having to do so in the digital world. There should always be an analogue option.\"</p><p>This strikes me as brilliant - digital rights would not be rights at all if they did not include a right to be non-digital, a status that, as the damning evidence piles up, may well become widely desired.</p><p>Eggers has been lecturing about online evils since 2013, when his novel The Circle was published, a Brave New World or Nineteen Eighty-Four for millennials and snowflakes. The Circle is a tech company, a combination of Facebook and Google, with dreams of world domination. It would achieve this primarily by eliminating privacy. Everybody ends up watching everybody else all the time, except during threeminute \"bathroom breaks\". The book was partly inspired by something Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, said: \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\" So Silicon Valley claims moral authority over us all.</p><p>\"Schmidt has said some of the most concerning things - they gave me a real chill. You feel privacy is only for deviants.\"</p><p>Will any of the big companies co-operate in this attempt to make them decent organisations? Google and Facebook have signed up to new internet standards designed by Berners-Lee that require companies to respect data privacy. But does that mean anything? \"I always thought that at least some of the major tech companies would accept some kind of regulatory framework if it were based on a commonsense understanding of morality, decency and democracy.\" This is naive, Eggers now admits, because there is a \"profound lack of humility\" in Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"It's one of the foundational problems with these companies. They walk in the door with the sense that they are the centre of the universe and the smartest people on the planet and their company is the most influential of all time.</p><p>\"That can lead to some terrible outcomes. They should have a more humble approach to their work and their place in the world. Also an awareness of their power and an awareness that they are just a tech company, sellers of emojis and frivolities. If they were a little bit more humble from top to bottom, I think we could have a conversation about regulation and basic human rights.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, the US political landscape is now so opposed to regulation of any kind, nothing is likely to happen. Eggers also sees little hope that other obvious ways to tame Silicon Valley will be used - for instance, legally defining the giants as publishers, which would make them responsible for their content, or breaking them up with competition laws.</p><p>\"There's no appetite for these things. The last time major monopolies were broken up was the phone companies and that was 40 years ago.</p><p>\"They are publishers, because these words online are permanent: they are able to be seen by thousands and millions of people. Of course they're publishers. But they've been dodging that and they will continue to do so. For whatever reason, tech companies remain above the law.\"</p><p>We are all to blame, he says. Users submit to highly addictive software and gadgets, affecting themselves and their children in the process. \"The more we require schoolchildren to do their work online, to spend more time in front of their screens, the more we are guiding them into a world we know is not good for them.\"</p><p>He compares the state of the internet companies to that of Big Tobacco in the early 1990s: the evidence against them is overwhelming but still we remain addicts.</p><p>Eggers himself uses a basic LG flip phone.

He asked how many were on Facebook. One hand went up. The rest regarded Facebook as some ridiculous and intrusive thing their parents did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They see it,\" he tells me, \"as the platform of their parents and grandparents. They are horrified by how they post photos of their vacations with them in them. They see this as an absurd, indiscriminate posting of life.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The catch is that the kids were all on WhatsApp and Instagram, both owned by Facebook. Even so, on top of the leaks of user data, the political meddling, the cackhanded cover-up and, last week, the immensely damaging email cache published by British MPs, the news that the kids find this social medium desperately uncool is one more reputational horror Facebook could do without. Nobody actually likes this company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Whenever there's something especially creepy,\" says Eggers, \"or especially duplicitous, it seems to come from Facebook. There's something culturally wrong at Facebook.\"</p><p>We've come to expect tone deafness from the Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, but now Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer, has been embarrassingly implicated in the creation of this culture. She was a hero of women in the workplace, the founder of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.LeanIn.org\">www.LeanIn.org</url>, which offers women \"ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals\". But the revelations about Facebook's attempts to cover up its part in Russian meddling in the 2016 American presidential election revealed she was a key player, an active participant in attempts to smear the company's critics.</p><p>As if that weren't bad enough for Sandberg, she has now been attacked even by the sainted Michelle Obama.</p><p>\"That whole 'so you can have it all'. Nope, not at the same time,\" Obama said. \"That's a lie. And it's not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn't work all the time.\"</p><p>The emails released by MPs may prove the most serious threat of all to the company. They show a deliberate crushing of competitors - possibly opening a route to an unfaircompetition action - even more ruthless harvesting of users' data and the sale of it to selected companies and covert trawling for information about competitors. The charge list is long and getting longer.</p><p>Nothing, in the circumstances, could be more topical than the talk Eggers is to give for this year's PEN HG Wells lecture in London. He is to speak on digital human rights: it is 70 years since the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was a development of Wells's 1940 essay The Rights of Man.</p><p>Others have made statements of digital human rights - notably Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web, and Stefano Quintarelli, an Italian politician and IT expert - but they talk about rights when you're already online. Eggers wants something more.</p><p>\"What I want to add is that as a society we really have to reverse or slow down what seems to be a headlong move toward every aspect of our lives, from social to civil to political, having to be conducted in the digital world. An essential human right should be that we should be able to participate as citizens without having to do so in the digital world. There should always be an analogue option.\"</p><p>This strikes me as brilliant - digital rights would not be rights at all if they did not include a right to be non-digital, a status that, as the damning evidence piles up, may well become widely desired.</p><p>Eggers has been lecturing about online evils since 2013, when his novel The Circle was published, a Brave New World or Nineteen Eighty-Four for millennials and snowflakes. The Circle is a tech company, a combination of Facebook and Google, with dreams of world domination. It would achieve this primarily by eliminating privacy. Everybody ends up watching everybody else all the time, except during threeminute \"bathroom breaks\". The book was partly inspired by something Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, said: \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\" So Silicon Valley claims moral authority over us all.</p><p>\"Schmidt has said some of the most concerning things - they gave me a real chill. You feel privacy is only for deviants.\"</p><p>Will any of the big companies co-operate in this attempt to make them decent organisations? Google and Facebook have signed up to new internet standards designed by Berners-Lee that require companies to respect data privacy. But does that mean anything? \"I always thought that at least some of the major tech companies would accept some kind of regulatory framework if it were based on a commonsense understanding of morality, decency and democracy.\"</p><p>This is naive, Eggers now admits, because there is a \"profound lack of humility\" in Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"It's one of the foundational problems with these companies. They walk in the door with the sense that they are the centre of the universe and the smartest people on the planet and their company is the most influential of all time.</p><p>\"That can lead to some terrible outcomes. They should have a more humble approach to their work and their place in the world. Also an awareness of their power and an awareness that they are just a tech company, sellers of emojis and frivolities. If they were a little bit more humble from top to bottom, I think we could have a conversation about regulation and basic human rights.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, the US political landscape is now so opposed to regulation of any kind, nothing is likely to happen. Eggers also sees little hope that other obvious ways to tame Silicon Valley will be used - for instance, legally defining the giants as publishers, which would make them responsible for their content, or breaking them up with competition laws.</p><p>\"There's no appetite for these things. The last time major monopolies were broken up was the phone companies and that was 40 years ago.</p><p>\"They are publishers, because these words online are permanent: they are able to be seen by thousands and millions of people. Of course they're publishers. But they've been dodging that and they will continue to do so. For whatever reason, tech companies remain above the law.\"</p><p>We are all to blame, he says. Users submit to highly addictive software and gadgets, affecting themselves and their children in the process. \"The more we require schoolchildren to do their work online, to spend more time in front of their screens, the more we are guiding them into a world we know is not good for them.\"</p><p>He compares the state of the internet companies to that of Big Tobacco in the early 1990s: the evidence against them is overwhelming but still we remain addicts.</p><p>Eggers himself uses a basic LG flip phone. He writes on a 14-year-old Apple Mac that is not connected to the internet. He checks his emails on another machine a couple of times a day.</p><p>\"All the old software still works and I don't have to submit myself to indentured servitude to Adobe or some other company.\"</p><p>Overall, though, he's optimistic. The Texas teenagers were no longer in thrall to the Valley giants and regarded their parents' screen addiction with dismay. He even detects signs that Zuckerberg is waking from his moral slumber, putting money into philanthropy and maybe even considering the possibility that he does not own the future. A lengthening list of smart Valley apostates are leaving, in disgust, these companies that peddle addiction.</p><p>\"All the power lies in the hands of users. They should use that power and opt out and move their money and their eyeballs elsewhere.</p><p>\"You can enact radical shifts. These things have only been around a few years, but we think of them as a permanent aspect of life. They shouldn't be.\"</p><p>Or, as Michelle Obama said so pithily of Sandberg's Lean In manifesto, \"that shit doesn't work all the time\". In the case of tech companies, one might add: \"If ever.\"</p><p>Dave Eggers will give the PEN HG Wells lecture at the Bridge Theatre, London SE1, at 5.30pm next Sunday</p><p>All the power lies in the hands of users. They should opt out</p><p>We guide children into a world we know is not good for them</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Eggers: Silicon Valley suffers a profound lack of humility</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-144424939</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXH-CTD1-JCBW-N54F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1357\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 9, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He asked how many were on Facebook. One hand went up. The rest regarded Facebook as some ridiculous and intrusive thing their parents did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They see it,\" he tells me, \"as the platform of their parents and grandparents. They are horrified by how they post photos of their vacations with them in them. They see this as an absurd, indiscriminate posting of life.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The catch is that the kids were all on WhatsApp and Instagram, both owned by Facebook. Even so, on top of the leaks of user data, the political meddling, the cackhanded cover-up and, last week, the immensely damaging email cache published by British MPs, the news that the kids find this social medium desperately uncool is one more reputational horror Facebook could do without. Nobody actually likes this company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Whenever there's something especially creepy,\" says Eggers, \"or especially duplicitous, it seems to come from Facebook. There's something culturally wrong at Facebook.\"</p><p>We've come to expect tone deafness from the Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, but now Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer, has been embarrassingly implicated in the creation of this culture. She was a hero of women in the workplace, the founder of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.LeanIn.org\">www.LeanIn.org</url>, which offers women \"ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals\". But the revelations about Facebook's attempts to cover up its part in Russian meddling in the 2016 American presidential election revealed she was a key player, an active participant in attempts to smear the company's critics.</p><p>As if that weren't bad enough for Sandberg, she has now been attacked even by the sainted Michelle Obama.</p><p>\"That whole 'so you can have it all'. Nope, not at the same time,\" Obama said. \"That's a lie. And it's not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn't work all the time.\"</p><p>The emails released by MPs may prove the most serious threat of all to the company. They show a deliberate crushing of competitors - possibly opening a route to an unfaircompetition action - even more ruthless harvesting of users' data and the sale of it to selected companies and covert trawling for information about competitors. The charge list is long and getting longer.</p><p>Nothing, in the circumstances, could be more topical than the talk Eggers is to give for this year's PEN HG Wells lecture in London. He is to speak on digital human rights: it is 70 years since the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was a development of Wells's 1940 essay The Rights of Man.</p><p>Others have made statements of digital human rights - notably Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web, and Stefano Quintarelli, an Italian politician and IT expert - but they talk about rights when you're already online. Eggers wants something more.</p><p>\"What I want to add is that as a society we really have to reverse or slow down what seems to be a headlong move toward every aspect of our lives, from social to civil to political, having to be conducted in the digital world. An essential human right should be that we should be able to participate as citizens without having to do so in the digital world. There should always be an analogue option.\"</p><p>This strikes me as brilliant - digital rights would not be rights at all if they did not include a right to be non-digital, a status that, as the damning evidence piles up, may well become widely desired.</p><p>Eggers has been lecturing about online evils since 2013, when his novel The Circle was published, a Brave New World or Nineteen Eighty-Four for millennials and snowflakes. The Circle is a tech company, a combination of Facebook and Google, with dreams of world domination. It would achieve this primarily by eliminating privacy. Everybody ends up watching everybody else all the time, except during threeminute \"bathroom breaks\". The book was partly inspired by something Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, said: \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\" So Silicon Valley claims moral authority over us all.</p><p>\"Schmidt has said some of the most concerning things - they gave me a real chill. You feel privacy is only for deviants.\"</p><p>Will any of the big companies co-operate in this attempt to make them decent organisations? Google and Facebook have signed up to new internet standards designed by Berners-Lee that require companies to respect data privacy. But does that mean anything? \"I always thought that at least some of the major tech companies would accept some kind of regulatory framework if it were based on a commonsense understanding of morality, decency and democracy.\" This is naive, Eggers now admits, because there is a \"profound lack of humility\" in Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"It's one of the foundational problems with these companies. They walk in the door with the sense that they are the centre of the universe and the smartest people on the planet and their company is the most influential of all time.</p><p>\"That can lead to some terrible outcomes. They should have a more humble approach to their work and their place in the world. Also an awareness of their power and an awareness that they are just a tech company, sellers of emojis and frivolities. If they were a little bit more humble from top to bottom, I think we could have a conversation about regulation and basic human rights.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, the US political landscape is now so opposed to regulation of any kind, nothing is likely to happen. Eggers also sees little hope that other obvious ways to tame Silicon Valley will be used - for instance, legally defining the giants as publishers, which would make them responsible for their content, or breaking them up with competition laws.</p><p>\"There's no appetite for these things. The last time major monopolies were broken up was the phone companies and that was 40 years ago.</p><p>\"They are publishers, because these words online are permanent: they are able to be seen by thousands and millions of people. Of course they're publishers. But they've been dodging that and they will continue to do so. For whatever reason, tech companies remain above the law.\"</p><p>We are all to blame, he says. Users submit to highly addictive software and gadgets, affecting themselves and their children in the process. \"The more we require schoolchildren to do their work online, to spend more time in front of their screens, the more we are guiding them into a world we know is not good for them.\"</p><p>He compares the state of the internet companies to that of Big Tobacco in the early 1990s: the evidence against them is overwhelming but still we remain addicts.</p><p>Eggers himself uses a basic LG flip phone. He writes on a 14-year-old Apple Mac that is not connected to the internet. He checks his emails on another machine a couple of times a day.</p><p>\"All the old software still works and I don't have to submit myself to indentured servitude to Adobe or some other company.\"</p><p>Overall, though, he's optimistic. The Texas teenagers were no longer in thrall to the Valley giants and regarded their parents' screen addiction with dismay. He even detects signs that Zuckerberg is waking from his moral slumber, putting money into philanthropy and maybe even considering the possibility that he does not own the future. A lengthening list of smart Valley apostates are leaving, in disgust, these companies that peddle addiction.</p><p>\"All the power lies in the hands of users. They should use that power and opt out and move their money and their eyeballs elsewhere.</p><p>\"You can enact radical shifts. These things have only been around a few years, but we think of them as a permanent aspect of life. They shouldn't be.\"</p><p>Or, as Michelle Obama said so pithily of Sandberg's Lean In manifesto, \"that shit doesn't work all the time\". In the case of tech companies, one might add: \"If ever.\"</p><p>Dave Eggers will give the PEN HG Wells lecture at the Bridge Theatre, London SE1, at 5.30pm next Sunday</p><p>We guide children into a world we know is not good for them</p><p>All the power lies in the hands of users. They should opt out</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Eggers: Silicon Valley suffers a profound lack of humility</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-144414775</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXH-CTF1-JCBW-N08J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1357\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Northern Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 9, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But you wouldn't know it from looking at your smartphone.</p><p><br/>There are 54 emoji to represent different modes of transportation, at least on modern iPhones. A mind-boggling 12 of them depict trains: You can text a friend everything from a light-rail car to a steam locomotive to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/what-50-years-of-bullet-trains-have-done-for-japan/381143/?utm_source=feed\">shinkansen</url>. There's a red coupe, a yellow taxi, an ambulance. There is even a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/electric-scooters-are-the-cargo-shorts-of-transportation/561440/?utm_source=feed\">scooter</url> emoji.<br/>But there is no pickup-truck emoji.<br/>I made the discovery earlier this week when I was trying to text my brother a pickup truck. (Like many young male Americans, I sometimes consider exploring new frontiers in rugged charadery by purchasing a 10-year-old Toyota Tacoma.) Then I discovered there were none to send.<br/>The pickup truck is not the only vehicular lacuna in the emojick pantheon. The Emoji Motors Dealership, stationed on some county highway beneath a gargantuan stars-and-stripes, would go out of business pretty quickly.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://autoalliance.org/economy/facts-about-auto-sales/\">Thirty-five percent of new cars</url> sold in the United States in 2017 were crossovers, yet there is no logographic Subaru Outback or Honda HR-V. There isn't even a minivan emoji. Just about the only utility vehicle in the emoji paddock is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://emojipedia.org/delivery-truck/\">a delivery truck</url>, but those are service vehicles, poorly suited to off-roading, and also insufficiently virile.<br/>Instead, there is only a sporty red coupe, the sole emoji vehicle that seems designed for daily drivers. This is obviously inadequate for today's overscheduled American families, but at least busy parents can type it in two positions:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://emojipedia.org/oncoming-automobile/\">head-on</url>, or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://emojipedia.org/automobile/\">from the side</url>. Even with this versatility, there remain more types of gondola lifts on the emoji keyboard (\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://emojipedia.org/mountain-cableway/\">mountain cableway</url>\" and \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://emojipedia.org/aerial-tramway/\">aerial tramway</url>\") than models of car.<br/>Why so few automobile emoji of any sort? Perhaps it arises from emoji's country of origin: Japan, a nation far more yoked to its trains than most.

Our own devices distract us, others' devices spy on us, social media companies poison public discourse, new wired objects violate our privacy, and all of this contributes to a general sense of runaway change careening beyond our control. No wonder there's a tech backlash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, really, is there? There certainly has been<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">talk</emphasis> of a backlash, for a couple of years now. Politicians have discussed regulating big tech companies more tightly. Fines have been issued, breakups called for. A tech press once dedicated almost exclusively to gadget lust and organizing conferences that trot out tech lords for the rest of us to worship has taken on a more critical tone; a drumbeat of expos\u00e9s reveal ethically and legally dubious corporate behavior. Novels and movies paint a skeptical or even dystopian picture of where tech is taking us. We all know people who have theatrically quit this or that social media service, or announced digital sabbaticals. And, of course, everybody kvetches, all the time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, there is the matter of our actual behavior in the real-world marketplace. The evidence there suggests that, in fact, we love our devices as much as ever. There is no tech backlash.</p><p>Consider Facebook: It's hard to imagine a more backlashable company. Facebook is widely associated with data breaches, the spread of dubious information and a basic deterioration of interpersonal communication. It was recently fined nearly $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission for mishandling its customers' data. And, given its ubiquity, it's also a handy stand-in for the corporatization of online life in general. If you're going to make a show of quitting a tech service, Facebook may be your best choice.</p><p>But according to its most recent quarterly report, the number of Facebook accounts used daily (1.59 billion) and monthly (2.4 billion) each increased by 8 percent over the prior quarter. Despite all the anecdotes you've heard about people deleting their accounts, the company's flagship app added about a million new daily users in the United States alone. Revenue was up 28 percent. Even factoring in the F.T.C. fine, Facebook recorded a profit of $2.6 billion.</p><p>Facebook is not the only demonized tech platform; social media companies in general are routinely criticized as toxic swamps full of trolls, liars and bots. But again, there's no evidence of any exodus. In the same quarter, Twitter added five million new daily users, and Snap reported that the daily user base of its flagship Snapchat app grew 7 percent, its best-ever performance as a public company. According to the Pew Research Center, 72 percent of Americans use some form of social media, a percentage that has risen steadily for years and shows no sign of flagging. (The people I know who quit Facebook all use Facebook-owned Instagram, WhatsApp, or both.)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[If you're online - and, well, you are - chances are someone is using your information. We'll tell you what you can do about it. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sign up for our limited-run newsletter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.]</emphasis></p><p>Habits die hard. But even more remarkable than our apparent reluctance to ditch the technologies we love to dis is a fervent embrace of newer new things that seem, at the very least, worth approaching with caution.</p><p>Take smart speakers - the kind that respond to vocal prompts and questions - as an example. It's exactly the sort of technology that gives people pause. Is this thing listening to me all the time? What about these weird stories of smart speakers laughing or cursing, or randomly recording a conversation and sending it to the owners' contacts? The tech press has gotten better and better at chronicling the latest troubling answers - for instance, people may in fact listen to your voice activations as part of the process of refining the device's functionality - and detailing what, if anything, you can do about it.</p><p>Nevertheless: As of last year, a little more than a quarter of American households owned a smart speaker, according to one estimate. The category leader is the Amazon Echo, equipped with the Alexa voice-recognition software; Amazon says it has sold more than 100 million Alexa devices.</p><p>Certain tech-use indicators have in fact leveled off in recent years, but that's mostly because they correspond with categories that are already thoroughly established and widespread: Around 95 percent of consumers in the United States say they have or use a cellphone, and 89 percent have or use the internet, according to Pew. But dig a little deeper into that data, and it turns out that \"new connected devices continue to emerge\" and we continue to embrace them. In addition to voice assistants, smart TVs and wearable devices are growing in popularity.</p><p>Perhaps most remarkable, if you think we're in the midst of tech backlash, is the traction of the aggressively hyped \"smart home\" trend, encouraging you to link your locks and lights and other household infrastructure to the internet. Amazon (which intuitively ought to be suffering in a tech-backlashed environment) recently announced that the record sales on its most recent Prime Day promotion included \"millions of smart home devices.\"</p><p>A particularly striking example touted by the company: gangbuster sales of Amazon's own Ring video doorbell system and related home surveillance and security products. Ring has formed partnerships with hundreds of police departments, encouraging users to share video directly with law enforcement. And the device and its associated neighborhood-communiqu\u00e9 app have been criticized for essentially encouraging racial profiling and general paranoia. Amazon has denied that Ring currently uses the company's spookily named Rekognition facial-recognition software (which is used by law enforcement agencies and businesses). But as reports by BuzzFeed and others have pointed out, the device's terms of service allow the company to use Ring-collected recordings to help develop new products and services. It's not hard to imagine this pointing to a future when the camera will \"recognize\" who your neighbors are.</p><p>That sounds like the sort of potentially invasive and controlling technology that would spark a public outcry - if not actual marching in the streets, then at least intense pressure on public officials to keep the tech giants in check, and on the tech giants themselves. But as with other unnerving-sounding innovations - self-driving cars, beacon devices that let retailers track customers' in-store behavior, delivery drones, cashier-less stores - we mostly just shrug. Or, as in the case of the Ring, actively participate in the aggressive spread of a technology whose potential implications are unclear.</p><p>So if there is no tech backlash, why is that? Probably a combination of factors. For starters, technology can be complicated, and most of us don't bother to read terms-of-service agreements, let alone try to understand how something like Alexa, or even Facebook, really works. By and large, tech companies prefer it this way, and they either actively obscure the way their algorithms make decisions or passively encourage you to focus on the post-user-manual idea that technology \"just works,\" and you don't need to worry about whys or (especially) hows.</p><p>Also, we really, really likemuch of what technology has to offer. There are good reasons to feel that way: Technology has improved the world, and our lives, in plenty of ways. But it often seems we are willing to overlook significant potential downsides in exchange for rather trivial payoffs. Apparently, for example, the main uses of voice technology are ordering a speaker to play music or asking for a weather report. (Another example, in the interest of full disclosure: My deep concerns about a citizen-enabled surveillance state have not yet inspired me to ditch my own Ring doorbell.)</p><p>Maybe being a more determined backlasher just feels hopeless. Quitting Facebook or boycotting Amazon seems similar to removing a drop of water from the ocean. Even an unfamiliar start-up backed with piles of venture capital has the resources to get around whatever entity is supposed to regulate it. The Luddites lost. Why not just learn to stop worrying and love the gizmos?</p><p>I wonder if the main reason more of us aren't active participants in a tangible tech backlash is that we assume lots of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">other</emphasis> people are. After all, the same tech lords people pay to worship at pricey conferences are now occasionally hauled before Congress, and there's some sense that cracking down on them might be a political winner.</p><p>Sure, the actual plans for doing so tend to be vague (and those tech lords don't seem to be suffering). But everybody's complaining about technology all the time - there's nothing more on-trend than lamenting our ephemeral hashtag culture. So it's easy to believe that there really is a roiling tech backlash that will somehow head off any dystopian outcomes, while we lean back and ask Alexa whether it's raining. In other words, it's a virtualbacklash: so convincing we can really see it, if we just wear the proper goggles.</p><p>Rob Walker (@notrobwalker) is the author of \"The Art of Noticing,\" and a columnist for Marker.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Like other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

Politicians have discussed       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">regulating</url> big tech companies more tightly.

A tech press once dedicated almost exclusively to gadget lust and organizing conferences that trot out tech lords for the rest of us to worship has taken on a more critical tone; a drumbeat of expos\u00e9s reveal ethically and legally dubious corporate behavior. Novels and movies paint a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">skeptical or even dystopian</url> picture of where tech is taking us. We all know people who have theatrically quit this or that social media service, or announced digital sabbaticals. And, of course, everybody kvetches, all the time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, there is the matter of our actual behavior in the real-world marketplace. The evidence there suggests that, in fact, we love our devices as much as ever. There is no tech backlash.</p><p>Consider Facebook: It\u2019s hard to imagine <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">a more backlashable company</url>. Facebook is widely associated with data breaches, the spread of dubious information and a basic deterioration of interpersonal communication. It was recently fined nearly $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">mishandling its customers\u2019 data</url>. And, given its ubiquity, it\u2019s also a handy stand-in for the corporatization of online life in general. If you\u2019re going to make a show of quitting a tech service, Facebook may be your best choice.</p><p>But according to its most recent quarterly report, the number of Facebook accounts used daily (1.59 billion) and monthly (2.4 billion) each <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">increased by 8 percent over the prior quarter</url>. Despite all the anecdotes you\u2019ve heard about people deleting their accounts, the company\u2019s flagship app       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">added about a million new daily users in the United States alone</url>. Revenue was up 28 percent. Even factoring in the F.T.C. fine, Facebook recorded a profit of $2.6 billion.</p><p>Facebook is not the only demonized tech platform; social media companies in general are routinely criticized as toxic swamps full of trolls, liars and bots. But again, there\u2019s no evidence of any exodus. In the same quarter, Twitter<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">added</url> five million new daily users, and Snap       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">reported</url> that the daily user base of its flagship Snapchat app grew 7 percent, its best-ever performance as a public company. According to the Pew Research Center, 72 percent of Americans       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">use</url> some form of social media, a percentage that has risen steadily for years and shows no sign of flagging. (The people I know who quit Facebook all use Facebook-owned Instagram, WhatsApp, or both.)</p><p>[If you\u2019re online \u2014 and, well, you are \u2014 chances are someone is using your information. We\u2019ll tell you what you can do about it. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">Sign up for our limited-run newsletter</url>.]</p><p>Habits <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">die hard</url>. But even more remarkable than our apparent reluctance to ditch the technologies we love to dis is a fervent embrace of newer new things that seem, at the very least, worth approaching with caution.</p><p>Take smart speakers \u2014 the kind that respond to vocal prompts and questions \u2014 as an example. It\u2019s exactly the sort of technology that gives people pause. Is this thing listening to me all the time? What about these weird stories of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">smart speakers laughing</url> or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">cursing</url>, or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">randomly recording a conversation and sending it to the owners\u2019 contacts</url>? The tech press has gotten better and better at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">chronicling</url> the latest troubling answers \u2014 for instance, people may in fact listen to your voice activations as part of the process of refining the device\u2019s functionality \u2014 and detailing what, if anything, you can do about it.</p><p>Nevertheless: As of last year, a little more than a quarter of American households owned a smart speaker, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">one estimate</url>. The category leader is the Amazon Echo, equipped with the Alexa voice-recognition software; Amazon says it has sold more than       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">100 million Alexa devices</url>.</p><p>Certain tech-use indicators have in fact leveled off in recent years, but that\u2019s mostly because they correspond with categories that are already thoroughly established and widespread: Around 95 percent of consumers in the United States say they have or use a cellphone, and 89 percent have or use the internet, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">according to Pew</url>. But dig a little deeper into that data, and it turns out that \u201cnew connected devices continue to emerge\u201d and we continue to embrace them. In addition to voice assistants, smart TVs and wearable devices are growing in popularity.</p><p>Perhaps most remarkable, if you think we\u2019re in the midst of tech backlash, is the traction of the aggressively hyped \u201csmart home\u201d trend, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">encouraging</url> you to link your locks and lights and other household infrastructure to the internet. Amazon (which intuitively ought to be suffering in a tech-backlashed environment) recently       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">announced</url> that the record sales on its most recent Prime Day promotion included \u201cmillions of smart home devices.\u201d</p><p>A particularly striking example touted by the company: gangbuster sales of Amazon\u2019s own Ring video doorbell system and related home surveillance and security products. Ring has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">formed partnerships</url> with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">hundreds</url> of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">police departments</url>, encouraging users to share video directly with law enforcement. And the device and its associated neighborhood-communiqu\u00e9 app have been       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">criticized</url> for essentially encouraging racial profiling and general paranoia. Amazon has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">denied</url> that Ring currently uses the company\u2019s spookily named Rekognition facial-recognition software (which is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">used</url> by law enforcement agencies and businesses). But as reports by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">BuzzFeed</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">others</url> have pointed out, the device\u2019s terms of service allow the company to use Ring-collected recordings to help develop new products and services. It\u2019s not hard to imagine this pointing to a future when the camera will \u201crecognize\u201d who your neighbors are.</p><p>That sounds like the sort of potentially invasive and controlling technology that would spark a public <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">outcry</url> \u2014 if not actual marching in the streets, then at least intense pressure on public officials to keep the tech giants in check, and on the tech giants themselves. But as with other unnerving-sounding innovations \u2014 self-driving cars,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">beacon devices</url> that let retailers track customers\u2019 in-store behavior, delivery drones, cashier-less stores \u2014 we mostly just shrug. Or, as in the case of the Ring, actively participate in the aggressive spread of a technology whose potential implications are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">unclear</url>.</p><p>So if there is no tech backlash, why is that? Probably a combination of factors. For starters, technology can be complicated, and most of us don\u2019t bother to read terms-of-service agreements, let alone try to understand how something like Alexa, or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">even Facebook</url>, really works. By and large, tech companies prefer it this way, and they either actively obscure the way their algorithms make decisions or passively encourage you to focus on the post-user-manual idea that technology \u201cjust works,\u201d and you don\u2019t need to worry about whys or (especially) hows.</p><p>Also, we really, really like much of what technology has to offer. There are good reasons to feel that way: Technology has improved the world, and our lives, in plenty of ways. But it often seems we are willing to overlook significant potential downsides in exchange for rather trivial payoffs. Apparently, for example, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">main uses</url> of voice technology are ordering a speaker to play music or asking for a weather report. (Another example, in the interest of full disclosure: My deep concerns about a citizen-enabled surveillance state have not yet inspired me to ditch my own Ring doorbell.)</p><p>Maybe being a more determined backlasher just feels hopeless. Quitting Facebook or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">boycotting Amazon</url> seems similar to removing a drop of water from the ocean. Even an unfamiliar start-up backed with piles of venture capital has the resources to get around whatever entity is supposed to regulate it. The Luddites lost. Why not just learn to stop worrying and love the gizmos?</p><p>I wonder if the main reason more of us aren\u2019t active participants in a tangible tech backlash is that we assume lots of other people are. After all, the same tech lords people pay to worship at pricey conferences are now occasionally hauled before Congress, and there\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">some sense</url> that cracking down on them       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">might</url> be       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">a political winner</url>.</p><p>Sure, the actual plans for doing so tend to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity\">vague</url> (and those tech lords don\u2019t seem to be suffering). But everybody\u2019s complaining about technology all the time \u2014 there\u2019s nothing more on-trend than lamenting our ephemeral hashtag culture. So it\u2019s easy to believe that there really is a roiling tech backlash that will somehow head off any dystopian outcomes, while we lean back and ask Alexa whether it\u2019s raining.

Our own devices distract us, others' devices spy on us, social media companies poison public discourse, new wired objects violate our privacy, and all of this contributes to a general sense of runaway change careening beyond our control. No wonder there's a tech backlash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, really, is there? There certainly has been talk of a backlash, for a couple of years now. Politicians have discussed regulating big tech companies more tightly. Fines have been issued, breakups called for. A tech press once dedicated almost exclusively to gadget lust and organizing conferences that trot out tech lords for the rest of us to worship has taken on a more critical tone; a drumbeat of expos\u00e9s reveal ethically and legally dubious corporate behavior. Novels and movies paint a skeptical or even dystopian picture of where tech is taking us. We all know people who have theatrically quit this or that social media service, or announced digital sabbaticals. And, of course, everybody kvetches, all the time. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  However, there is the matter of our actual behavior in the real-world marketplace. The evidence there suggests that, in fact, we love our devices as much as ever. There is no tech backlash.</p><p>  Consider Facebook: It's hard to imagine a more backlashable company. Facebook is widely associated with data breaches, the spread of dubious information and a basic deterioration of interpersonal communication. It was recently fined nearly $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission for mishandling its customers' data. And, given its ubiquity, it's also a handy stand-in for the corporatization of online life in general. If you're going to make a show of quitting a tech service, Facebook may be your best choice.</p><p>  But according to its most recent quarterly report, the number of Facebook accounts used daily (1.59 billion) and monthly (2.4 billion) each increased by 8 percent over the prior quarter. Despite all the anecdotes you've heard about people deleting their accounts, the company's flagship app added about a million new daily users in the United States alone. Revenue was up 28 percent. Even factoring in the F.T.C. fine, Facebook recorded a profit of $2.6 billion.</p><p>Facebook is not the only demonized tech platform; social media companies in general are routinely criticized as toxic swamps full of trolls, liars and bots. But again, there's no evidence of any exodus. In the same quarter, Twitter added five million new daily users, and Snap reported that the daily user base of its flagship Snapchat app grew 7 percent, its best-ever performance as a public company. According to the Pew Research Center, 72 percent of Americans use some form of social media, a percentage that has risen steadily for years and shows no sign of flagging. (The people I know who quit Facebook all use Facebook-owned Instagram, WhatsApp, or both.)</p><p>  [If you're online -- and, well, you are -- chances are someone is using your information. We'll tell you what you can do about it. Sign up for our limited-run newsletter.]</p><p>  Habits die hard. But even more remarkable than our apparent reluctance to ditch the technologies we love to dis is a fervent embrace of newer new things that seem, at the very least, worth approaching with caution.</p><p>  Take smart speakers -- the kind that respond to vocal prompts and questions -- as an example. It's exactly the sort of technology that gives people pause. Is this thing listening to me all the time? What about these weird stories of smart speakers laughing or cursing, or randomly recording a conversation and sending it to the owners' contacts? The tech press has gotten better and better at chronicling the latest troubling answers -- for instance, people may in fact listen to your voice activations as part of the process of refining the device's functionality -- and detailing what, if anything, you can do about it.</p><p>  Nevertheless: As of last year, a little more than a quarter of American households owned a smart speaker, according to one estimate. The category leader is the Amazon Echo, equipped with the Alexa voice-recognition software; Amazon says it has sold more than 100 million Alexa devices.</p><p>  Certain tech-use indicators have in fact leveled off in recent years, but that's mostly because they correspond with categories that are already thoroughly established and widespread: Around 95 percent of consumers in the United States say they have or use a cellphone, and 89 percent have or use the internet, according to Pew. But dig a little deeper into that data, and it turns out that ''new connected devices continue to emerge'' and we continue to embrace them. In addition to voice assistants, smart TVs and wearable devices are growing in popularity.</p><p>  Perhaps most remarkable, if you think we're in the midst of tech backlash, is the traction of the aggressively hyped ''smart home'' trend, encouraging you to link your locks and lights and other household infrastructure to the internet. Amazon (which intuitively ought to be suffering in a tech-backlashed environment) recently announced that the record sales on its most recent Prime Day promotion included ''millions of smart home devices.''</p><p>  A particularly striking example touted by the company: gangbuster sales of Amazon's own Ring video doorbell system and related home surveillance and security products. Ring has formed partnerships with hundreds of police departments, encouraging users to share video directly with law enforcement. And the device and its associated neighborhood-communiqu\u00e9 app have been criticized for essentially encouraging racial profiling and general paranoia. Amazon has denied that Ring currently uses the company's spookily named Rekognition facial-recognition software (which is used by law enforcement agencies and businesses). But as reports by BuzzFeed and others have pointed out, the device's terms of service allow the company to use Ring-collected recordings to help develop new products and services. It's not hard to imagine this pointing to a future when the camera will ''recognize'' who your neighbors are.</p><p>  That sounds like the sort of potentially invasive and controlling technology that would spark a public outcry -- if not actual marching in the streets, then at least intense pressure on public officials to keep the tech giants in check, and on the tech giants themselves. But as with other unnerving-sounding innovations -- self-driving cars, beacon devices that let retailers track customers' in-store behavior, delivery drones, cashier-less stores -- we mostly just shrug. Or, as in the case of the Ring, actively participate in the aggressive spread of a technology whose potential implications are unclear.</p><p>  So if there is no tech backlash, why is that? Probably a combination of factors. For starters, technology can be complicated, and most of us don't bother to read terms-of-service agreements, let alone try to understand how something like Alexa, or even Facebook, really works. By and large, tech companies prefer it this way, and they either actively obscure the way their algorithms make decisions or passively encourage you to focus on the post-user-manual idea that technology ''just works,'' and you don't need to worry about whys or (especially) hows.</p><p>  Also, we really, really like much of what technology has to offer. There are good reasons to feel that way: Technology has improved the world, and our lives, in plenty of ways. But it often seems we are willing to overlook significant potential downsides in exchange for rather trivial payoffs. Apparently, for example, the main uses of voice technology are ordering a speaker to play music or asking for a weather report. (Another example, in the interest of full disclosure: My deep concerns about a citizen-enabled surveillance state have not yet inspired me to ditch my own Ring doorbell.)</p><p>  Maybe being a more determined backlasher just feels hopeless. Quitting Facebook or boycotting Amazon seems similar to removing a drop of water from the ocean. Even an unfamiliar start-up backed with piles of venture capital has the resources to get around whatever entity is supposed to regulate it. The Luddites lost. Why not just learn to stop worrying and love the gizmos?</p><p>  I wonder if the main reason more of us aren't active participants in a tangible tech backlash is that we assume lots of other people are. After all, the same tech lords people pay to worship at pricey conferences are now occasionally hauled before Congress, and there's some sense that cracking down on them might be a political winner.</p><p>  Sure, the actual plans for doing so tend to be vague (and those tech lords don't seem to be suffering). But everybody's complaining about technology all the time -- there's nothing more on-trend than lamenting our ephemeral hashtag culture. So it's easy to believe that there really is a roiling tech backlash that will somehow head off any dystopian outcomes, while we lean back and ask Alexa whether it's raining. In other words, it's a virtual backlash: so convincing we can really see it, if we just wear the proper goggles.</p><p>  Rob Walker (@notrobwalker) is the author of ''The Art of Noticing,'' and a columnist for Marker.</p><p>  Like other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

(AFP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world needs global regulation for social media content to prevent extremist, abusive and untrue content from propagating on the platforms, the former prime minister of New Zealand told Al Arabiya English.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand and head of the United Nations Development Programme who today runs a charitable foundation, said she hoped to build international consensus on the need to put limits on content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I do think freedom of speech and expression is extremely important, but I think there have to be codes of conduct where you draw a line. It's not okay to propagate terrorist beliefs and organizations. It's not okay to bully a teenager to death. It's not okay to tell lies about other people,\" explained Clark, in an interview with Al Arabiya English during her visit to the UAE.</p><p>\"In New Zealand, we have statutory regulation of broadcasting and we have quite strong self-regulation of print media, but social media globally has been a just a free-fire zone,\" she adds, pointing to the lack of regulation producing a \"totally libertarian\" attitude to social media in which extremism can thrive.</p><p>Clark is no stranger to the consequences of online extremism. In March this year, a white supremacist shot and killed 51 people and wounded a further 50 at a mosque and Islamic center in the city of Christchurch. The killer had posted a manifesto on right-wing forums online, and livestreamed footage of the attacks on several platforms.</p><p>Social media companies failed to stop the spread of the footage, which was viewed around 4,000 times during the 17-minute atrocities and repeatedly re-uploaded afterwards.</p><p>In the aftermath of the attacks, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, together with French President Emmanuel Macron, issued the \"Christchurch Call\" \u2013 a commitment to \"eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online to stop the internet being used as a tool for terrorists.\"</p><p>Social media platforms have traditionally been exempted from liability for the content that users publish on their networks, in stark contrast to newspapers and digital news outlets which are subject to national regulations.</p><p>While Clark says she is aware of the dangers of \"heavy-handed regulation,\" she is critical of what she calls the current \"libertarian\" approach to regulation: \"There has to be limits, and so you have to look at how those limits will be defined, and then how will those limits be upheld,\" she explained.</p><p>Twitter's recent decision to ban political ads revived the debate over regulation. Facebook continues to make big profits from political advertising and spends millions of dollars lobbying governments around the world to avoid regulation, especially as it relates to the protection of individual data privacy.</p><p>Helen Clark is working to support the \"Christchurch Call\" through her charitable body, the Helen Clark Foundation. In a paper titled \"Anti-social media: Reducing the spread of harmful content on social media networks,\" the foundation makes the case for greater regulation of social media. Focusing on New Zealand, the report claims there are \"significant gaps\" in the \"regulation of social media companies and their legal obligations to reduce harm on their platforms.\"</p><p>Her team's report has received praise from experts within the industry.</p><p>\"The Helen Clark Foundation's report is an important contribution to the debate and makes some sensible recommendations to impose a duty of care on platforms to mitigate the risks of harm, to be overseen by a regulator,\" the CEO of independent media regulator IMPRESS Jonathan Heawood told Al Arabiya English.</p><p>However, since the report was released in May, there has been little legal change in democratic states across the world, according to Heawood.</p><p>\"We need to see more detail on how the duty of care and 'harm' is defined in practical settings before we can judge the impact of these proposals,\" he added.</p><p>Global solutions \u2013 and risks</p><p>Clark hopes that the upcoming Paris Peace Forum can be the forum to take her foundation's ideas global. \"The Christchurch Principles\" is one of the 114 global governance projects being discussed at the forum, which is taking place November 11-13 and being attended by heads of states and international organizations.</p><p>\"What the team has done for the Paris Peace Forum, is they've drawn up a set of principles around how you approach the issue \u2026 and they've come up with 10 principles \u2026 to take it from the New Zealand level to a global level for a democratic society,\" explained Clark.</p><p>Yet it is unclear how a consolidated global regulator of social media could emerge or operate without stemming from national and regional governments.</p><p>\"There is no global body with the democratic legitimacy to impose regulation on social media, so we need to work at a national and regional level to create systems that balance the free speech of users and platforms with the rights of others,\" Heawood told Al Arabiya English.</p><p>Regulation also inevitably comes with the risk of being abused.</p><p>\"Autocratic and transitional states\" have exploited the narrative around \"fake news\" to enact laws and regulations which have a \"chilling effect\" for journalist and civil society groups, added Heawood.</p><p>In the Middle East, only Jordan has signed up to the \"Christchurch Call.\" Most recently, the Iraqi government has shut down internet access for entire parts of the country in the face of widespread anti-government protests.</p><p>Clark suggested that as the region has been hit particularly hard by online extremism, \"it could be attractive to a wide range of governments to come along with the call and work with the countries like New Zealand, France, Jordan and others.\"</p><p>Twitter, Facebook under fire</p><p>Clark also said that irresponsible use of social media extends far beyond extremism, pointing to bullying, misinformation and political campaigning among other issues.</p><p>Clark welcomed Twitter's decision to ban paid political ads on its platform and said that ads on social media should face similar regulatory processes to broadcast and television adverts.</p><p>Her comments come amid recent criticism of social media networks for facilitating the spread of \"fake news,\" with Twitter's rival Facebook accused of allowing politicians to pay for adverts on the network which critics have said contain deliberate lies or falsehoods.</p><p>Amid signs that the calls for regulation of social media are gaining traction, the prominent Democratic Party US presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren recently said that big tech companies have \"too much power\" and called for the breakup of big tech giants like Facebook and Google.</p><p>New platforms are also presenting new challenges, as the nature of social media constantly evolves. Clark suggests governments should try to stay up to date by hiring \"young tech geeks.\"</p><p>\"The governments need to invest capacity into the implications of emerging tech technologies for peace in society,\" said Clark. \"That is probably going to mean being prepared to recruit people much, much earlier than you otherwise would have. Because they're the ones who are up with the technology.\"</p><p>Clark herself has been a high-profile user of social media \"since Snapchat,\" including during her time as the head of the UNDP and is keen to point out the positives it can bring.</p><p>\"I found it useful and still do today, for putting ideas out there, drawing awareness to things,\" said Clark, also pointing to the benefits on small businesses, advertising agencies, travel, and other sectors.</p><p>She also pointed to the role of social media in the Arab uprisings of 2011, although noting that they didn't all turn out successfully.</p><p>\"I think we can all see the potential for good and connecting. But there is a balance to be mindful of, and [we need] to work out how to have a regular, true response,\" she added.</p><p>Helen Clark was prime minister of New Zealand 1999-2008 and administrator of the United Nations Development Programme 2009-2017.

And in August of that year, Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist and co-founder of Netscape, published an essay whose title became a catchphrase: \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460\">Why Software Is Eating the World</url>.\" Tech had become the golden child of the post-crisis era, with San Francisco its new capital.Then came glory days for the tech sector. After an IPO stumble, Facebook cracked the code of mobile advertising and became a $US350 billion company. Amazon rode the success of its Amazon Web Services cloud platform to a similar valuation. Apple and Alphabet, parent company of Google, jockeyed to become the most valuable company in the world. Rise of the tech giants The rest of corporate America tried to adopt the language of tech, with words like \"disruption\" entering the popular lexicon. Chambers of commerce pitched their cities as the next Silicon Valley. General Electric advertised itself as a digital company rather than an industrial one.This growth has changed tech's role in society. In 2010, the new tech boom may have been best defined by trivial consumer companies with smartphone apps like Groupon and Zynga, which offered coupons to yoga classes and a few minutes of gaming distraction.Today's tech titans are anything but trivial. Facebook, once a way to keep up with your friends, has evolved to be a dominant media platform for news and public opinion. Amazon has gone from dominating e-commerce to increasingly appearing like it will dominate commerce. Uber started out as a way for tech workers in San Francisco to hail black cars, but now aims to increase its market share for all ground transportation around the world.When companies become this important in society, their stumbles are judged harshly. In recent months Facebook has gotten in hot water with conservatives who saw a partisan bias in its human-curated \"trending\" news product, and with liberals for censoring the Pulitzer-winning \"Napalm Girl\" photograph from the Vietnam War.Some of Amazon and Google's services, like Prime Now and Google Fiber, have been implemented in dense and wealthy urban areas at the exclusion of less-wealthy and rural communities, raising questions of social equity and discrimination.Should Uber's market share grow to the extent that it becomes an essential service for communities, its ability to leave cities that resist it, as it did this year in Austin, would further the view of some that the company behaves like a bully. Powerful founders An equally disturbing trend in this generation of tech companies is the extent to which founders and executives have structured their firms to limit the power of shareholders and other outsiders. Facebook and Google both have created multiple classes of shares to ensure that key shareholders retain majority control of their companies. And, to be fair, investors who don't like this arrangement can choose simply not to own the stock.But should, say, Facebook make a unilateral unpopular move to censor a sensitive topic from its news feed to serve either its financial or ideological interests, a populist mob might scream, \"Mark Zuckerberg doesn't have the right to decide what a billion people can or cannot see.\" And they would be right.And what would happen then? Consider past examples. When Wall Street and the housing sector became the targets of populist anger, they faced fines and increased regulations. When government becomes a target, there is less political will for funding and broad powers.For the technology sector, we'd likely see a combination of three things - fines for misbehaviour, increased regulation, and perhaps even federal action to break up perceived monopolists.Some have called the early 21st century a new Gilded Age. If it is, the next question is who will be to this era what Teddy Roosevelt was to the prior one: the people's champion who broke the power of ruthless monopolists.Conor Sen is a portfolio manager for New River Investments in Atlanta.

Uber started out as a way for tech workers in San Francisco to hail black cars, but now aims to increase its market share for all ground transportation around the world.When companies become this important in society, their stumbles are judged harshly. In recent months Facebook has gotten in hot water with conservatives who saw a partisan bias in its human-curated \"trending\" news product, and with liberals for censoring the Pulitzer-winning \"Napalm Girl\" photograph from the Vietnam War.Some of Amazon and Google's services, like Prime Now and Google Fiber, have been implemented in dense and wealthy urban areas at the exclusion of less-wealthy and rural communities, raising questions of social equity and discrimination.Should Uber's market share grow to the extent that it becomes an essential service for communities, its ability to leave cities that resist it, as it did this year in Austin, would further the view of some that the company behaves like a bully. Powerful founders An equally disturbing trend in this generation of tech companies is the extent to which founders and executives have structured their firms to limit the power of shareholders and other outsiders. Facebook and Google both have created multiple classes of shares to ensure that key shareholders retain majority control of their companies. And, to be fair, investors who don't like this arrangement can choose simply not to own the stock.But should, say, Facebook make a unilateral unpopular move to censor a sensitive topic from its news feed to serve either its financial or ideological interests, a populist mob might scream, \"Mark Zuckerberg doesn't have the right to decide what a billion people can or cannot see.\" And they would be right.And what would happen then? Consider past examples. When Wall Street and the housing sector became the targets of populist anger, they faced fines and increased regulations. When government becomes a target, there is less political will for funding and broad powers.For the technology sector, we'd likely see a combination of three things - fines for misbehaviour, increased regulation, and perhaps even federal action to break up perceived monopolists.Some have called the early 21st century a new Gilded Age. If it is, the next question is who will be to this era what Teddy Roosevelt was to the prior one: the people's champion who broke the power of ruthless monopolists.Conor Sen is a portfolio manager for New River Investments in Atlanta.

Will Google shut down internal dissent and silence whistleblowers? Or will the company live up to its initial motto, \"Don't be evil?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2017, researchers Meredith Whittaker and Kate Crawford founded the AI Now Institute at New York University, with the goal of \"produc[ing] interdisciplinary research on the social implications of artificial intelligence [in] four key domains: rights and liberties, labor and automation, bias and inclusion, and safety and critical infrastructure.\" Since then, the group has published key research on race and gender discrimination in AI, public agency accountability, litigation related to algorithms, and more. (Full disclosure: The ACLU is a proud partner of AI Now.)</p><p>Both Whittaker and Crawford have strong ties to the tech industry. The former is the founder of Google's Open Research Group, and the latter is a principal researcher at Microsoft. Both women still work for these companies, even though their work at AI Now often critiques the tech industry's shortcomings and offers a perspective rooted in human and civil rights, instead of profit maximization an unorthodox perspective in the Valley, to put it mildly.</p><p>For years, I've been impressed that Whittaker and Crawford could simultaneously work for and offer public critiques of these big tech companies and took that as an indication that Google and Microsoft are mature, if problematic, institutions. A willingness to tolerate internal dissent is important in any organization. Fostering such an environment is especially critical for companies like Google and Microsoft in the United States, where lawmakers have largely refused to impose regulations, leaving a dangerous amount of power in the hands of an elite and often obsessively secretive few in Silicon Valley.</p><p>But recent events suggest that at least at Google, executive patience with democratic debate and a culture of openness is wearing thin. According to press reports, Google has in recent months retaliated against both Whittaker and a fellow activist at the company, Claire Stapleton, after their successful organizing led to policy change at the nearly trillion dollar company.</p><p>In October 2018, The New York Times reported that Google had provided handsome exit packages to executives credibly accused of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. The former head of the Android group, Andy Rubin, was paid $90 million to leave the company after he was accused of sexual wrongdoing. Google subsequently invested millions of dollars in a company controlled by Mr. Rubin. Then, in March of this year, the Times published yet more evidence that Google sought to protect powerful men accused of sexual malfeasance. The latest report showed that in 2016, Google paid executive Amit Singhal $45 million when he left the firm after an employee accused him of groping her at a work event.</p><p>But while Google provided golden parachutes to executives accused of sexual harassment and assault, the company simultaneously forced the victims of those incidents to take their complaints against the company through arbitration, denying them their day in court.</p><p>Googlers, led by activists like Whittaker and Stapleton, rebelled. In November 2018, 20,000 Googlers worldwide walked off the job, demanding the forced arbitration policy be repealed. The protest, joined by one in five Google employees worldwide, attracted global press and was devastatingly effective. Within days, the company announced it would eliminate the forced arbitration policy for people who spoke out about sexual harassment in the workplace. In February, facing further demands from workers, Google scrapped its forced arbitration clause entirely.</p><p>Whittaker's organizing at the company hasn't been limited to fighting for changes to the internal policy governing employee rights. She has been unapologetic in her defense of democratic values and has challenged Google's work with the U.S. military and Chinese government. More recently, she was part of a group of concerned Googlers who protested the appointment of a transphobic reactionary from the Heritage Foundation to an external advisory board tasked with examining questions related to AI and ethics. That board was subsequently dissolved.</p><p>Now, Whittaker says, she's facing retaliation from the company for her efforts to make Google a more accountable, equitable, and democratic institution. According to a letter she sent to co-workers, executives recently told her she would be forced to choose between her work with AI Now and her employment at the company. Claire Stapleton, one of the organizers of the anti-arbitration walkout, says she too has faced retaliation for her organizing, which included a demotion only reversed when she hired a lawyer.</p><p>Google denies it retaliated against either employee. But last Friday, Whittaker and Stapleton organized a group of hundreds of Googlers to engage in a company-wide meeting about retaliation workers have faced across the world. According to them, over 300 people submitted their own testimonies that Google leadership has retaliated against them for their organizing. And Google employees are holding a sit-in tomorrow to protest retaliation they say employee organizers have faced.</p><p>In AI Now's 2018 annual report, Whittaker and her colleagues wrote about the important role whistleblowers play at institutions like Google:</p><p>Technology companies should provide protections for conscientious objectors, employee organizing, and ethical whistleblowers. Organizing and resistance by technology workers has emerged as a force for accountability and ethical decision making. Technology companies need to protect workers' ability to organize, whistleblow, and make ethical choices about what projects they work on. This should include clear policies accommodating and protecting conscientious objectors, ensuring workers the right to know what they are working on, and the ability to abstain from such work without retaliation or retribution. Workers raising ethical concerns must also be protected, as should whistleblowing in the public interest.</p><p>As Whittaker and her activist colleagues have demonstrated over the past few years, the world is watching Google and other big tech companies. The decisions these companies make about product design, political lobbying, and which technologies they'll build and sell to which types of governments impact all of us and future generations. That's why retaliating against Big Tech employees who push their employers to do the right thing isn't just a threat to the individual livelihoods of those workers it's a threat to us all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122893012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W13-5HS1-DYTH-G11C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1148\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The company has clashed with residents over its decision to collect datain public spaces such as intersections or park benches. Sidewalk Labs claims the data will help them improve the community, but experts worry it could be used for financial gain. In response to this criticism, the company has proposed an independent trust that might ensure the fair use of urban data.Imagine living in a city that can monitor almost everything you do in a day, from when you're stopped at a traffic light to when you've left the oven light on for too long. </p><p>Then imagine that data could be shared with companies or governments in unprecedented ways. That could be the reality awaiting future residents of Quayside[1], a12-acre planned neighborhood along Toronto's Eastern Waterfront. The project, which could cost up to $1 billion[2], is being developed by Sidewalk Labs[3], theurban innovation arm of Google's parent company, Alphabet. After first announcing the neighborhood in 2017,Sidewalk Labs revealed more of its plans[4] in August, which include futuristic innovations like heated roadwaysbuilt for driverless vehicles and robots that deliver mail and transport garbage through underground tunnels. One particularly striking feature has led to a growing battle between the developers, data experts, and local activists. Sidewalk Labs plans to install a layer of sensors that measure things like traffic, air quality,noise, and building occupancy.The technology behind these ideas will most likely consist ofcameras or lasers[5]that detect objects as they pass by. This would make it easier to regulate building temperatures, reduce energy usage, and even provide transit discounts for low-income residents. It's all part of the company's mission[6] to develop\"the most measurable community in the world.\" It's achievement that might seem groundbreaking, but for those worried about privacy, the Quayside neighborhood could set a disturbing precedent for the future of data collection.The controversial side of data sharingWhen plans for Quayside were first unveiled, there was plenty of excitement surrounding the project. On the day of the announcement,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the new neighborhood[7] would transform the area to \"into a thriving hub for innovation.\" But the prime minister's claim that the project would \"put people first\" has fallen under increasing scrutiny over the last year.One of themany fears[8]circulating throughout the Toronto area is that data will be shared with other governments or entities outside Canada. These fears come amidst[9] an increasingly tense relationship between the public and major tech companies[10] that share their information. ThoughSidewalk Labshas promised to make all of its public data anonymous, the company has not agreed to keep its data local. Sidewalk Labs believes that data can be governed under Canadian law without exclusively residing in the country. This would allow companies \u2014 and particularly startups \u2014 outside Canadato compete in the global digital market. The way to protect this data, according to the proposal, is to develop strong contracts and methods of encryption.But the nature and terms of these contracts remain unclear.\"If you don't define a boundary, you don't know when there's a breach,\" saidSaadia Muzaffar, a technology expert who resigned[11] from the project's Digital Strategy Advisory Panel[12]over a lack of transparency. The panel, which formed in April, focuses on guiding the fair and safe use of data technology in the Quayside neighborhood. The Globe and Mail reports[13] that at least three other panel advisers are weighing their resignations.Even Toronto's mayor, John Tory, has expressed \"acute concern[14]\" over a lack of clear communication with the public.Creating a \"gatekeeper\" of citizen dataEarlier this week, Sidewalk Labs took a major step to clarify its intentions.  The companyissued a lengthy proposal[15] foran independent trust that would serve as the gatekeeper of \"urban data,\" or data that is collected from urban citizens in a public place (like an intersectionor park). According to Sidewalk Labs, there are no existing laws that determine ownership of this information, and few regulations that successfully protect it. The data trust would holdSidewalk Labs to the same standards as any other company or government body. Sidewalk Labs also plans to allow other companies to deploy digital infrastructure in Quayside \u2014 a move that would encourage healthy competition, but introduce a new set of players with their own interests. But what about those who simply don't want their activity monitored?According toMicah Lasher, the head of policy and communications at Sidewalk Labs, this practice is already happening with or without their knowledge. \"Urban data is a fact of life in cities around the world, and more so with every passing day,\" he said, citing the surveillance cameras[16] that have become ubiquitous in many neighborhoods.An escalating conflictWhile Sidewalk Labs says its data will be used to benefit the Quayside community, its desire to spearhead the collection process has many experts worried. \"It's not up to Sidewalk Labs to implement a data trust. It's between a government and its residents,\" said Bianca Wylie, the co-founderof Tech Reset Canada[17]. Wylie questions the need for Sidewalk Labs to collect personal information, worrying it could be usedto further its financial interests. \"No matter how much you build in privacy by design, this project is about power,\" said Nasma Ahmed, theexecutive director at Digital Justice Lab[18]. \"Sidewalk Labs has approached this project and talked about it in a way that makes you feel like they are the governing body.\" Her words call to mind criticism of Mark Zuckerberg[19], who has referred to Facebook[20] as \"more like a government than a traditional company.\" Sidewalk Labs is not making that claim \u2014 in fact, quite the opposite \u2014 but it hasn't been able to fend off the association.\"People have understandably wanted to see evidence that [data is not part of our business model],\" said Lasher. \"In some respects, [our proposal] provided that.'Though Lasher maintains that \"much of the decision-making [for the data trust] will ultimately be up to policymakers and government,\" there's still a chance that the company will give some input.\"These are not finished policies,\" Lasher said. \"At some point, we may have ideas that we put forward [on how the trust should be structured].\" That's the problem, according to data experts, who have taken to Twitter[21] to express their opposition. It's also part of the reason whyMuzaffar resigned in early October.After witnessing what she calls a \"disappointing\" reaction to citizens' concerns from both Sidewalk Labs and its partner, Waterfront Toronto,Muzaffar decided she had seen enough.  Among the many issues raised in herresignation letter[22],Muzaffar referencedreports[23] that Sidewalk Labs had asked potential consultants to either hand over intellectual property or issue an exclusive, royalty-free license. That could force competition to dwindle, since not all firms would be willing to agree to these terms. As Wylie wrote in a recent blog post[24], it also \"confirms one of the ways Sidewalk Labs may be expecting to make a return on its investment.\" Both Wylie and Muzaffar have also called out Sidewalk Labs for suggesting that its data partnerships would need to align with its corporate mission \u2014 another sign that the company may be prioritizing its own interests above those of residents. Lasher said[25] the phrasing was \"an error, nothing more.\"Too little too late?Amid this back and forth, many have criticized the timing of Sidewalk Labs' proposal.Muzaffar called it \"hasty,\" while Wylie called it\"pure public relations theater\" and \"a panicked, rushed move after weeks of bad press.\" Though Lasherinsists that Sidewalk Labs has been brainstormingthese solutions since before the Quayside launch, he acknowledges the pressure from the public.\"Of course we read what's written and said about the project,\" he said. \"These are ideas that have evolved, developed, and benefited from what we've heard.\" The question now is whether Sidewalk Labs will listen to feedback from its latest proposal and allow it to guide its future efforts. According toMuzaffar, this will require more careful reflection than the company has demonstrated thus far. \"There's this false sense of hurry,\" she said. \"So what if we take time and do this right? I think we should.\"NOW WATCH: 3 compelling reasons why we haven't found aliens yet[26]See Also: Saudi Arabia wants to build a $500 billion megacity that's 33 times as large as New York City.

That includes the iPhone, one of the most profitable products of all time. Investors in Apple don't know what to make of this company that still throws off billions in profit \u2014 $7.8 billion last quarter[1] \u2014 but seems to have stopped growing. So Apple analysts debate margins, and average sales prices, upgrade rates and channel inventories to see whether the world's most valuable company is worth 10% more or less than what the market currently thinks.\u00a0 The thing is, there is a bull case for Apple \u2014 a case that says that Apple is worth way more than its current price-to-earnings ratio of around 12. But the company's historic and counterproductive obsession with secrecy prevents any executives or company officials from even suggesting that Apple could have prospects for growth beyond its current products. </p><p>So analysts can't build Apple's considerable growth upside into its projections \u2014 meaning that the company trades at a price-earnings ratio similar to \"a steel mill going out of business,\" as investor Marc Andreessen put it\u2014 significantly less than other big tech companies, like Microsoft (with a P/E as of this writing of 27), Alphabet (31), Facebook (76), and Amazon (313!).New industriesIt appears like Apple is poised to make plays in three major industries with considerable barriers to entry: Apple is building a car[2], or car software, or something automotive[3]. Apple has made simplifying healthcare into a corporate focus[4], and CEO Tim Cook has hinted\u00a0about future products that may require Food and Drug Administration approval. Apple's been hiring experts and buying companies[5] in augmented reality and virtual reality, and the industry is full of speculation about a mobile VR product centered around the iPhone.\u00a0 We don't know anything official about these projects, and Apple won't say anything. It never says anything until it has a nearly finished product with a rough ship date in the next few months.\u00a0 But the company is certainly spending money on them, at an annual run rate of nearly $10 billion:On its surface, it's a smart move \u2014 why alert competitors to the audacious bets you're making?\u00a0 But there are legitimate reasons why an investor might want to discourage Apple from making these bets \u2014 especially if they never turn into products. Building a car is hard, for instance, and extremely capital intensive. Healthcare is quirky and medical devices are heavily regulated. Virtual and augmented reality has shown almost no\u00a0signs of being a healthy\u00a0business.\u00a0It also hurts Apple's development efforts when Apple can't publicly go after the talent they need to break into these industries.\u00a0 But for investors, there's no timeline for any of these products. The car is supposedly shipping in 2020, or 2021, according to press reports. It could be years before your doctor prescribes\u00a0an Apple Watch and a strict regimen of tracking your vital stats.\u00a0 Investors and analysts keep asking, and Cook keeps blowing them off, like during the last conference call:\u00a0 In R...rowth, we do continue to invest significantly in R..... The products that are in R...there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping. And so I don't want to talk about the exact split of it. He never does.\u00a0 And that leaves openings for analysts and stock professionals to write stuff like Colin Gillis of BCG Financial did[6] earlier this week, before Apple's earnings call.\u00a0\"Our opinion is that Apple has peaked under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook,\" he wrote. That might not be true, but Apple won't contradict him.\u00a0'We generally do not discuss our\u00a0purpose or plans'There are competitive advantages to staying mum. Given Samsung's and other competitors' proclivity to rip off Apple designs and technology, running a leak-free ship gives Apple a head start on the market when new products do come out.\u00a0 Apple tipping off its competitors to companies it wants to buy would be stupid, too.\u00a0 And\u00a0it's hard to change a company's stripes. Apple employees from the 1990s have told me that the company was secretive back then, but that the tone became even more clandestine\u00a0when former CEO Steve Jobs reclaimed the helm in 1997. But Jobs was a product genius \u2014 he thought he knew what customers wanted before they did. And in the case of the iMac, iPod, and iPhone, he was right. Now Cook is CEO. He's a corporate guy, an operations guy. And the only wholly new product released under his watch \u2014 the Apple Watch \u2014 has suffered a 55% drop in sales in its second year in the market, according to IDC[7]. (I'm not saying the Apple Watch isn't a great product, but mine's been in my junk drawer for months.) And all three of Apple's major product lines are selling fewer units than they did a year ago. And head of design Jony Ive, Apple's top product guy, sounds like he's taken a much less involved role[8]\u00a0with the company.\u00a0 Apple won't expand on Ive's new role,\u00a0nor what longtime executive Bob Mansfield is doing with the Apple Car[9].\u00a0 So it's\u00a0natural for investors to want an answer to what\u00a0Apple's doing, or at least a clue. In the case of the car project: Is Apple\u00a0building batteries? Self-driving software? A ride-sharing service? Without official communication, Apple could reveal the fruit of a six-year multi-billion dollar project\u00a0for the first time and it could end up being an embarrassing flop like\u00a0The Homer[10].\u00a0 It's not crazy to ask for a little bit of guidance, maybe\u00a0something like Tesla CEO Elon Musk's master plan[11]. Cook and his team need to tell us where Apple is going, even if they don't lay out how it's\u00a0going to get there.\u00a0NOW WATCH: Elon Musk just unveiled Tesla's 'top secret' master plan \u2014 here are the details[12]See Also: The real reason Tim Cook loves Pok\u00e9mon Go is that it proves Apple has been right all along[13]Microsoft just released an iPhone app it says takes better photos

That's not bad, especially given all the volatility in the market and the severe slump in the economy since March because of coronavirus. </p><p>However, the index is is weighted by market value. That means that the strong performances of the five tech giants that dominate the blue chips -- Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook -- distort the S&amp;P 500's overall return.</p><p>It's one reason some half-jokingly refer to the S&amp;P 500 as the \"S&amp;P 5.\" </p><p>But the index tells a different story when you look at the many other stocks in the S&amp;P 500. An Invesco S&amp;P 500 ETF that equally weights all of the index members is down more than 6% this year. </p><p>Market not as strong without the Fab 5 of tech</p><p>Nearly 60% of the companies in the index were in the red for 2020 through Thursday's close, according to data from Refinitiv.</p><p>\"Without Big Tech's influence, the broad market would not look quite as stable as it does today,\" analysts from Zacks Investment Research said in a report last week.</p><p>The over-reliance on this tech quintet could become a problem if Congress and the president (whether it's Donald Trump in a second term or Joe Biden) decide to impose tougher regulations on or launch specific antitrust investigations against industry leaders sometime after the election.</p><p>\"Though Congress is not likely to pass any meaningful legislation this year, there appears to be growing consensus that the current course for Big Tech is not sustainable. From an investment standpoint, the suggestion is that long-term outperformance may not be sustainable, either,\" the Zacks analysts wrote.</p><p>International stocks have more momentum lately</p><p>The strong gains of the top techs also make it look like the US market is doing better than international stocks. But dig deeper and that too is untrue.</p><p>Strategists from Schwab recently noted that if you exclude the 5 giant tech stocks and compare the S&amp;P 500 only to international stocks, foreign companies have actually done slightly better than the US market over the past three months. </p><p>The alphabet-soup-named SPDR MSCI ACWI ex-US ETF, which holds top international companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Nestle, Taiwan Semiconductor and Roche, is up nearly 5% since mid-June while the equal weighted S&amp;P 500 ETF is up less than 1%.</p><p>\"The outperformance by the biggest US stocks is hiding a change in leadership by the average stock: The average international stock has been outperforming the average US stock,\" said Jeff Kleintop, chief global Investment strategist for Charles Schwab, in a report. </p><p>\"The recent imbalances in the stock market can lead to vulnerability,\" he added.</p><p>Even Warren Buffett appears to be signaling that he's finding more value abroad. The Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway recently bought stakes in five top Japanese trading firms.</p><p>\"The fact that the world's most famous investor has committed to such large sums has ramifications for both domestic and international perceptions about Japanese equities,\" said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management, in a report.</p><p>Vail thinks the Berkshire endorsement \"marks a true turning point\" for Japanese stocks. He said that bears no longer have a good argument for their skepticism. </p><p>\"No one will be able to speak quite as dourly, as the retort should typically be, 'But Buffett Disagrees,'\" Vail said.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Sure, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 3% so far this year. That\u2019s not bad, especially given all the volatility in the market and the severe slump in the economy since March because of coronavirus.    However, the index is is weighted by market value. That means that the strong performances of the five tech giants that dominate the blue chips \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook \u2014 distort the S&amp;P 500\u2019s overall return.    It\u2019s one reason some half-jokingly refer to the S&amp;P 500 as the \u201cS&amp;P 5.\u201d    But the index tells a different story when you look at the many other stocks in the S&amp;P 500. An Invesco S&amp;P 500 ETF that equally weights all of the index members is down more than 6% this year.   Market not as strong without the Fab 5 of tech   Nearly 60% of the companies in the index were in the red for 2020 through Thursday\u2019s close, according to data from Refinitiv.    \u201cWithout Big Tech\u2019s influence, the broad market would not look quite as stable as it does today,\u201d analysts from Zacks Investment Research said in a report last week.    The over-reliance on this tech quintet could become a problem if Congress and the president (whether it\u2019s Donald Trump in a second term or Joe Biden) decide to impose tougher regulations on or launch specific antitrust investigations against industry leaders sometime after the election.    \u201cThough Congress is not likely to pass any meaningful legislation this year, there appears to be growing consensus that the current course for Big Tech is not sustainable. From an investment standpoint, the suggestion is that long-term outperformance may not be sustainable, either,\u201d the Zacks analysts wrote.   International stocks have more momentum lately   The strong gains of the top techs also make it look like the US market is doing better than international stocks. But dig deeper and that too is untrue.    Strategists from Schwab recently noted that if you exclude the 5 giant tech stocks and compare the S&amp;P 500 only to international stocks, foreign companies have actually done slightly better than the US market over the past three months.    The alphabet-soup-named SPDR MSCI ACWI ex-US ETF, which holds top international companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Nestle, Taiwan Semiconductor and Roche, is up nearly 5% since mid-June while the equal weighted S&amp;P 500 ETF is up less than 1%.    \u201cThe outperformance by the biggest US stocks is hiding a change in leadership by the average stock: The average international stock has been outperforming the average US stock,\u201d said Jeff Kleintop, chief global Investment strategist for Charles Schwab, in a report .    \u201cThe recent imbalances in the stock market can lead to vulnerability,\u201d he added.    Even Warren Buffett appears to be signaling that he\u2019s finding more value abroad. The Oracle of Omaha\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway recently bought stakes in five top Japanese trading firms .    \u201cThe fact that the world\u2019s most famous investor has committed to such large sums has ramifications for both domestic and international perceptions about Japanese equities,\u201d said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management, in a report.    Vail thinks the Berkshire endorsement \u201cmarks a true turning point\u201d for Japanese stocks. He said that bears no longer have a good argument for their skepticism.    \u201cNo one will be able to speak quite as dourly, as the retort should typically be, \u2018But Buffett Disagrees,'\u201d Vail said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

That means that the strong performances of the five tech giants that dominate the blue chips -- Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) -- distort the S&amp;P 500's overall return. It's one reason some half-jokingly refer to the S&amp;P 500 as the \"S&amp;P 5.\" But the index tells a different story when you look at the many other stocks in the S&amp;P 500. An Invesco S&amp;P 500 ETF () that equally weights all of the index members is down more than 6% this year. Market not as strong without the Fab 5 of tech Nearly 60% of the companies in the index were in the red for 2020 through Thursday's close, according to data from Refinitiv. \"Without Big Tech's influence, the broad market would not look quite as stable as it does today,\" analysts from Zacks Investment Research said in a report last week. The over-reliance on this tech quintet could become a problem if Congress and the president (whether it's Donald Trump in a second term or Joe Biden) decide to impose tougher regulations on or launch specific antitrust investigations against industry leaders sometime after the election. \"Though Congress is not likely to pass any meaningful legislation this year, there appears to be growing consensus that the current course for Big Tech is not sustainable. From an investment standpoint, the suggestion is that long-term outperformance may not be sustainable, either,\" the Zacks analysts wrote. International stocks have more momentum lately The strong gains of the top techs also make it look like the US market is doing better than international stocks. But dig deeper and that too is untrue. Strategists from Schwab (SCHW) recently noted that if you exclude the 5 giant tech stocks and compare the S&amp;P 500 only to international stocks, foreign companies have actually done slightly better than the US market over the past three months. The alphabet-soup-named SPDR MSCI ACWI ex-US ETF (CWI), which holds top international companies such as Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY), Nestle (NSRGF), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Roche (RHHBF), is up nearly 5% since mid-June while the equal weighted S&amp;P 500 ETF is up less than 1%. \"The outperformance by the biggest US stocks is hiding a change in leadership by the average stock: The average international stock has been outperforming the average US stock,\" said Jeff Kleintop, chief global Investment strategist for Charles Schwab, in a report. \"The recent imbalances in the stock market can lead to vulnerability,\" he added. Even Warren Buffett appears to be signaling that he's finding more value abroad. The Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) recently bought stakes in five top Japanese trading firms. \"The fact that the world's most famous investor has committed to such large sums has ramifications for both domestic and international perceptions about Japanese equities,\" said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management, in a report. Vail thinks the Berkshire endorsement \"marks a true turning point\" for Japanese stocks. He said that bears no longer have a good argument for their skepticism. \"No one will be able to speak quite as dourly, as the retort should typically be, 'But Buffett Disagrees,'\" Vail said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

He is speaking about Facebook, the global corporate beast that he helped unleash and which he is now devoted to raging again. \"I don't have any personal animus here at all,\" he continues. \"I actually understand how these guys got there. Do I wish they hadn't got there? Of course I do. But am I shocked? No.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All this might provoke a raised eyebrow from McNamee's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Mark Zuckerberg. Since dramatically falling out with Facebook after the 2016 US election, McNamee has become one of the company's foremost critics, accusing it of ruining elections, violating privacy, promoting extremism and poisoning public debate through its attention-grabbing news feed algorithms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He describes the use of such algorithms, bluntly, as \"the equivalent of drinking a bottle of Scotch and then getting behind the wheel\". He calls Libra, Facebook's new global digital currency, \"a pretty fundamental attack\" on the power of nation states. To the now-common aphorism \"if you're not paying for it, you're the product\", he shoots back: \"Bulls---!</p><p>You're the fuel - not even the product.\" His book, released last February and chronicling his Damascene conversion, is Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe.</p><p>\"The tech industry is today where the chemicals industry was in 1960,\" he says. \"Where the medicine industry was in 1900. Where the building trades were after the great fires [of the US 19th century]... in each case we determined that these industries were so important to the future of the economy that you couldn't afford to let them operate without some regulatory supervision.\"</p><p>This warning carries all the more weight because of McNamee's history. Starting as a fund manager for T Rowe Price in the Eighties, he soon became a high-flying Silicon Valley insider, founding three investment firms (his most recent, Elevation Partners, was a joint venture with the U2 singer Bono) and backing Netscape, Amazon, Electronic Arts and Seagate. At the time, he compared himself to Forrest Gump - an innocent who accidentally finds himself on the front lines of history. (He is also a touring musician with the rock band Moonalice.) To a young Zuckerberg, however, McNamee was an elder sage.</p><p>At their first meeting in 2006, he urged the 22-year-old founder not to sell his company to anyone, even for a billion dollars (an eye-watering price back then). In fact, Yahoo had already made that exact offer; Zuckerberg followed the advice and turned it down. Over the next three years McNamee became one of Zuckerberg's mentors, most notably convincing him in 2007 to hire Sheryl Sandberg, who remains in post as Facebook's hugely influential chief operating officer.</p><p>\"There's a lot of things about Mark that are very cool,\" says McNamee, who is now 63 years old. \"In a world full of misogynists, I don't think Mark is. When I brought him the idea of hiring Sheryl, he embraced it. I'm serious: there are a not lot of people in Silicon Valley who would have done that, OK?... I thought Mark would be different. And that part was right.\"</p><p>McNamee is no longer in contact with either executive, but he still speaks of them fondly. \"I knew them intimately when we were all younger. I had a great relationship with them,\" he says. He describes Zuckerberg as \"precocious\", with \"exceptional entrepreneurial skills at an unusually young age\"; \"socially awkward\", certainly, but not in an uncomfortable way. \"I enjoyed his company,\" he concludes. \"Remember, Silicon Valley's got a lot of socially awkward people. And there are times when I've been awkward.\"</p><p>Hence, when McNamee first become alarmed about Facebook's effect on society, he first tried to approach the pair \"as a friend\". Only when that effort was rebuffed did he throw himself into rallying support in Washington DC and beyond for greater regulation of Big Tech. Today, he fears that Zuckerberg has acquired an almost messianic belief in his own work, motivated by a drive for \"efficiency\" that is incompatible with the messiness of human liberty.</p><p>\"[Mark] looks at the world through his own lens,\" McNamee says. \"He thinks that the thing he is doing is the most important thing anyone could be doing right now. He has more people using his product every month than there are citizens in any country; he's larger than the largest religions. And he has concluded from this that Facebook no longer should be controlled by any sovereign nation.\"</p><p>Among the most disconcerting changes, he says, has been Zuckerberg's \"embrace\" of Donald Trump. Despite its overwhelmingly liberal workforce and reputation for Left-wing bias, many of its key policy advisers come from the US Republican Party, beneficiaries of a pragmatic hiring strategy that McNamee describes as \"classic Sheryl\". More recently, Zuck himself has been criticised for undisclosed meetings with conservative politicians, including Trump himself, and has begun inveighing against the dangers of a rising China, one of the President's favourite themes.</p><p>\"Mark has learned a lot about politics in the last two years,\" says McNamee. \"I think it's pretty clear that when he went to Washington in 2018 he really went as a novice. And he has been very effective for the most part since then.\" McNamee sees Facebook's decision to exempt politicians from its fact-checking programme, among other policies, as an attempt to curry favour in Washington and shield the company from unwanted regulation. So far, he claims, it has worked.</p><p>A spokesman for Facebook disputed that picture, saying that McNamee had not been involved with the company for years and that he was ignoring its \"massive investments\" in safety and election security. \"The notion that we are aligned with any one political figure or party runs counter to our values and the facts,\" she added.</p><p>Facebook also maintains that its algorithms no longer seek to maximise users' attention, and are instead crafted to ensure that people enjoy the service even if that means using it less.</p><p>But McNamee is not impressed by the self-regulatory measures that Facebook has adopted since 2016: not its advert library, not its forthcoming \"supreme court\", not the privacy reforms pressed upon it by US trade regulators and not the deal it made with civil rights activists to stop advertisers from discriminating by race and gender. \"I don't believe that Facebook has made any changes that mean anything... this was mostly about trying to appear to be cooperative without actually being cooperative,\" he says.</p><p>That is why he continues to press for far stricter regulations than Zuckerberg wants, arguing that the industry will not change unless forced to. He has high hopes for the British Government's plan, announced after a campaign by the Daily Telegraph, to impose a legal duty of care on social media firms and to make individual executives personally liable for the worst breaches.</p><p>Yet he is adamant that regulators must go further, interpreting the duty as a ban on all forms of attention-based algorithmic selection. \"Every time a terrorist who was motivated by Facebook kills somebody, [that's] due to algorithmic amplification,\" he says. \"The outcome from this business model is that people are going to get hurt.\"</p><p>Ultimately, he believes that stricter regulation will be good for the industry, helping it \"move onward\" from the \"damage\" it has done. \"I have no grudges, right?\" he says. \"I look at them and I think what's going on right now is probably very frustrating to them.\" Granted, there is \"no way on God's green earth\" that they will undertake the necessary changes voluntarily. But then, that is why Roger McNamee is no longer asking nicely.</p><p>Age: 63 Education: BA in history from Yale University, MBA from Dartmouth College Family: Married to music theorist and sometimes bandmate Ann Kosakowski McNamee Big Break: Appointed to rescue T Rowe Price's first science and tech fund in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash Interests: Singer and guitarist with his rock band, Moonalice;

When will banks start deploying products and services that leverage this capability?<br/>and so on.<br/> There's already about 300 new things that I can see happening as a result of these changes, and the list grows every day.<br/> However, I disagree with my friends out there who threaten that the players who will\u00a0create and\u00a0provide these new services will\u00a0be Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook.<br/> As mentioned, banking has big barriers to entry from capital requirements to compliance to licencing to auditability and more.<br/> For these reasons, banks will continue to be the core providers of transactions, whilst the Google's, Amazon's, Apple's and Facebook's will partner with them to provide innovations in the everything, everywhere world.<br/> Or that's my two-penneth worth for today.<br/> Let's see how we feel tomorrow ;-)<br/> [1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/bF1lUGpQO-o\">http://www.youtube.com/embed/bF1lUGpQO-o</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4PJcABbtvtA\">http://www.youtube.com/embed/4PJcABbtvtA</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-FSCB10799813697304603701195800</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCB-6705</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58HS-CHC1-JCMN-Y26S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><timeReceived>8:41 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Financial Services Club Blog</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>May 28, 2013 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.organization\"><classificationItem><className>ATT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon.com</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NCR</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>David Cameron</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Barack Obama</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tom Selleck</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chris Skinner</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Humour</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter's calling out of Trump's charges that postal voting is fraudulent - he believes it helps onlyDemocrats - followed his vicious trolling of MSNBC host and former Republican congressman JoeScarborough, all but alleging he murdered one of his aides. It is a wholly false, despicable, filthy charge, and Trump has utterly resisted recanting the slander, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/us/politics/trump-scarborough-twitter.html\">prefers to keep it alive</url>: \"It's certainly a very suspicious situation. Very sad, very sad and very suspicious.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/opinion/twitter-trump-fact-checking.html\">What to do</url> with a President who lies continuously from a bully pulpit with over 80 million followers?</p><p>Under US law, Twitter and social media platforms lie somewhere between traditional publishers and broadcasters - who have full control over access to their platforms and the content they present on those media - and public utilities, or common carriers, which are pipes along which anyone can travel with no control by the owner of the content of the flow. If it's electricity or telephony or data bits, the medium carries the message.</p><p>Finding the balance in setting and enforcing content standards between digital platforms, with their unlimited capacity and unlimited access by anyone who wants it, is this century's tech governance issue. Twitter is not legally liable for what appears on its website - the posters of content are. Twitter does have standards against abusive bullying, and Trump's critics want the company to apply it and delete his account - notwithstanding that he is the President of the United States. But it is precisely because a US President is unique - there is no other - the company has decided it is in the public interest to let the man rip, and let the people decide how they view him and hold him to account.</p><p>Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that....</p><p>??? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>May 27, 2020</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>But on the issue of facts and truth, Twitter has now taken a harder line, and is cautioning Trump posts that are not within factual bounds. That's what Twitter has started doing with Trump's tweets - provoking his rage. Twitter went further with a warning Trump violated platform standards and masked a tweet on the violence in Minneapolis and the urgency of the National Guard to restore order. Trump wrote: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"</p><p>Can Trump retaliate further? Speech beyond obscenity, fraud, defamation, incitement to lawless activity is protected by the First Amendment and beyond Trump's reach. This is especially true for any attempt by the US government to censor Twitter's platform, or block it - as is done in China.</p><p>Trump can punish certain players. Amazon owns The Washington Post, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/trump-campaign-sues-washington-post-for-defamation.html\">a publisher Trump loathes</url>. Trump has targeted Amazon's taxes and Postal Service shipping rates. Trump is after Comcast, owner of NBC. His Justice Department brought AT&amp;T, owner of CNN,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/congress-must-investigate-whether-trump-intervened-in-the-atandt-case/2019/03/06/fabeaf60-4038-11e9-a0d3-1210e58a94cf_story.html\">to court</url>. Trump's railing against media companies as the \"enemy of the people\" is reminiscent of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/11/trumps-threat-to-nbc-license-is-exactly-what-nixon-did/\">President Nixon</url> seeking to have The Washington Post stripped of its TV licenses during the paper's heroic reporting of Watergate. Nixon resigned his office in disgrace for his abuses of power.</p><p>Trump values his Twitter account more than any other soap box - including Fox News. His 80 million followers dwarf the 4.5 million who watch Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson - and Trump has complete control of his message, even if Twitter adds a fact check.</p><p>The executive order Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/trump-doesn-t-care-if-he-wins-his-fight-with-twitter-he-just-wants-the-battle-20200529-p54xke.html\">has signed</url> seeks to treat internet platforms as publishers, like The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age newspapers. But that would not solve his problem - because his tweets would still be subject to editorial accuracy by the companies.</p><p>What Trump can do to Big Tech to bring the companies to heel is to break them up. And in the antitrust arena Facebook, Google and Amazon are very vulnerable on substantive and political grounds. Investigations of their market and anticompetitive power are underway in Congress, at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, and in several US states. These investigations parallel the exceptional work done here by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in a landmark <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-platforms-inquiry\">report</url> on digital platforms and how these companies are harming media and advertising markets. Politically - and this is crucial - Republicans hate Big Tech because of their perceived \"liberal\" bias, and Democrats are after them because of their immense size and market power. Silicon Valley's greed and excesses have brought Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren together, and it is resonating across Washington. Quite a feat.</p><p>The executive order Trump signed will become a pinata in the courts. The discipline of abusive market power, not control of political content, is the surest way of to serve the public's interest - as opposed to Trump's.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bruce Wolpe is a senior fellow at the United States Studies Centre.

High-profile figures such as Facebook[2] CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former President Barack Obama, and \"Wonder Woman\" actress Gal Godot have all appeared in deepfake videos in recent years. Congress has been discussing legal measures that could be taken to mitigate the potential damage inflicted by deepfake video content, but doing so without impacting free speech could prove challenging. Using algorithms to identify deepfakes could also be difficult considering those who are creating such videos will likely find ways to circumvent such detection methods, experts say. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] In a video that surfaced[4] about a month ago, Mark Zuckerberg blankly stared into the camera from what appeared to be an office. He made a simple request of his viewers. \"Imagine this for a second,\" he said. \"One man, with total control of billions of people's stolen data. All their secrets, their lives, their futures.\" Except it wasn't really the Facebook CEO. It was a digital replica of him known as a deepfake[5]: a phony video created using AI that can make it look like a person said or did something they have never actually done.  Recognizable faces ranging from actor Kit Harrington as Jon Snow from \"Game of Thrones\"[6] to former President Barack Obama have been the subject of such videos over the past year. And while these videos can be harmless, such as the clip of Jon Snow apologizing for the way the beloved HBO series ended, the technology has raised serious concerns about how manipulating videos and photos through artificial intelligence could potentially be used to spread misinformation or damage one's reputation. And according to experts, the deepfake movement isn't likely to slow down anytime soon. \"Technologically speaking, there is nothing we can do,\" said Ali Farhadi, senior research manager for the computer vision group at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. \"The technology is out there, [and] people can start using it in whatever way they can.\"'We're entering an era in which our enemies can make anyone say anything at any point in time'It's unclear precisely when deepfakes were invented, but the trend began to gain widespread attention in late 2017 when a fake porn video purporting to feature \"Wonder Woman\" actress Gal Gadot was published on Reddit by a user who went by the pseudonym \"deepfakes,\" as Vice reported[7] at the time. Since then, a range of doctored videos featuring high-profile celebrities and politicians have appeared online \u2014 some of which are meant to be satirical, others which have portrayed public figures in a negative light, and others which were created to prove a point. Videos of famous movie scenes that had been digitally altered to feature actor Nicholas Cage's face went viral in early 2018[8], representing the lighter side of the spectrum showing how such tools could be used to foster entertainment. Then last April, BuzzFeed posted[9] an eerily realistic fake video showing former president Barack Obama saying words he had never spoken as part of an effort to spread awareness about the potential risks that come with using such technology in devious ways. \"We're entering an era in which our enemies can make anyone say anything at any point in time,\" the Obama deepfake says in the video. Read more: Facebook, Google, and Apple are going on the defense as the battle cry to break up 'big tech' gets louder than ever[10] Facebook also recently found itself in hot water after it refused to take down[11] a slowed down video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that made it look as if she had been intoxicated. While that video wasn't technically a deepfake, it still raised questions about how easily video can be doctored and distributed. At the end of June, a controversial web app called DeepNude[12] allowed users to create realistic naked images of women just by uploading photos to the app, demonstrating how such AI technologies could be used nefariously. The app has since been shut down.  The manipulation of digital video and images is not new. But advancements in artificial intelligence, easier access to tools for altering video, and the scale at which doctored videos can be distributed are. Those latter two points are largely the reason why deepfakes may be prompting more concern than the rise of other photo and video editing tools in the past, says John Villasenor, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a professor of electrical engineering, public policy, law, and management at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"Everyone's a global broadcaster now,\" said Villasenor. \"So I think it's those two things together that create a fundamentally different landscape than we had when Photoshop came out.\" Deepfakes are created by using training data \u2014 i.e. images or videos of a subject \u2014 to construct a three-dimensional model of a person, according to Villasenor. The amount of data required could vary depending on the system being used and the quality of the deepfake you're trying to create. Developing a convincing deepfake could require thousands of samples, says Farhadi, while Samsung developed an AI system that was able to generate a fabricated video clip with just one photo[13]. Even though the technology has become more accessible and sophisticated that it once was, it still requires some level of expertise such as an understanding of deep learning algorithms, says Farhadi. \"It's not like with a click of a button you start generating deepfakes,\" he says. \"It's a lot of work.\"'An arms race'It's likely impossible to prevent deepfakes from being created or to prohibit them from spreading on social media and elsewhere. But even if it was possible to do so, outright banning deepfakes likely isn't the solution. That's because it's not the technology itself, but how it's being used, that can be problematic, says Maneesh Agrawala, the Forest Baskett Professor of Computer Science and director of the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Stanford University. So eliminating deepfakes may not address the root of the issue. \"Misinformation can still be presented even if the video is 100% real,\" said Agrawala. \"So the concern that we have is with misinformation, not so much with the technologies that are creating these videos.\" That begs the question as to what can be done to prevent deepfakes from being used in dangerous ways that potentially could cause harm. Experts seem to agree that there are two potential approaches: technological solutions that can detect when a video has been doctored and legal frameworks that penalize those who use the technology to smear others. Neither avenue is fool-proof, and it's still unclear how such fixes would work. Although a clear solution doesn't exist yet, the question over how to address deepfakes has been a topic of discussion within Congress in recent months. Last December, Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska proposed a bill known as the \"Malicious Deep Fake Prohibition Act of 2018[14],\" which seeks to prohibit \"fraudulent audiovisual records.\" The \"DEEP FAKES Accountability Act[15]\" proposed by New York Democratic Representative Yvette Clarke in June requires that altered media is clearly labeled as such with a watermark. The proposed bill would also impose civil and criminal penalties for violations. But imposing legislation to crack down on deepfakes in a way that doesn't infringe on free speech or impact public discourse could be challenging, even if such rules do provide exceptions for entertainment content, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation[16] notes. The Zuckerberg deepfake,[17] for example, was created as part of an exhibit for a documentary festival. \"I think it's important to be careful and nuanced in how we talk about the potential for damage,\" says Agrawala, who along with other researchers from Stanford, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Princeton University, and Adobe Research created an algorithm that can edit talking-head videos through text[18]. \"I think there are a number of really important use cases for that kind of technology.\" Plus, taking legal action is often time-consuming, which could make it difficult to use legal measures to mitigate potential harm stemming from deepfakes. \"Election cycles are influenced over the course of sometimes days or even hours with social media, so if someone wants to take legal action that could take weeks or even months,\" says Villasenor. \"And in many cases, the damage may have already been done.\" Read more: Apple CEO Tim Cook called out companies like Facebook, Theranos, and YouTube in a speech pushing for responsibility in Silicon Valley[19] According to Farhadi, one of the most efficient ways to address the issue is to build systems that can distinguish a deepfake from a genuine video. This can be done by using algorithms that are similar to those that have been developed to create deepfakes in the first place, since that data can be used to train the detectors. But that may not be very helpful for detecting more sophisticated deepfakes as they continue to evolve, says Sean Gourley, the founder and CEO of Primer AI, a machine intelligence firm that builds products for analyzing large data sets. \"You can kind of think of this like zero-day attacks in the cybersecurity space,\" says Gourley. \"The zero-day attack is one that no one's seen before, and thus has no defenses against.\"  As is often the case with cybersecurity, it can be difficult for those trying to solve issues and patch bugs to remain one step ahead of malicious actors. The same goes for deepfakes, says Villasenor. \"It's sort of an arms race,\" he says. \"You're always going to be a few steps behind on the detection.\"NOW WATCH: Google finally revealed Stadia pricing, games, and release date[20]See Also: Here's how to perform 'Control-F' on an iPhone, which lets you search for specific text on any mobile webpage[21]Executives from Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google will be grilled over monopoly fears by lawmakers on Capital Hill next week[22]Steve Jobs and Jony Ive, once the two most important people at Apple, are no longer there.

Such rescues have their place, and few would deny that the Covid-19 pandemic called for dramatic intervention. But there is a downside to this reflex to intervene, which has become more automatic over the past four decades. Our growing intolerance for economic risk and loss is undermining the natural resilience of capitalism and now threatens its very survival.    The world economy went into this pandemic vulnerable to another financial crisis precisely because it had already become so fragile, so heavily dependent on constant government help. Governments have offered increasingly easy credit and generous bailouts not only to soften the impact of every crisis since the 1980s but also to try to boost growth during the good times.    Now, amid the worst crisis since World War II, governments are riding to the rescue again. In the U.S., the Treasury is adding trillions in automatic crisis spending (such as benefits for the unemployed) and discretionary spending (like cash payments to single jobholders making up to $99,000). The Federal Reserve is doing its part by cutting rates, printing massive amounts of new money and directly buying the debt of troubled companies for the first time.    The governments of many other countries are, likewise, launching an array of stimulus measures that would have been unimaginable a few months ago. The mantra of government officials is that these efforts are not only necessary but also will carry no cost or consequences. They believe that they can easily borrow to pay for it all because the last four decades of easy money have brought interest rates to near or less than zero: Money is free.    This is a dangerous form of denial. A growing body of research shows that constant government stimulus has been a major contributor to many of modern capitalism's most glaring ills. Easy money fuels the rise of giant firms and, along with crisis bailouts, keeps alive heavily indebted \"zombie\" firms at the expense of startups, which typically drive innovation. All of this leads to low productivity -- the prime contributor to the slowdown in economic growth and a shrinking of the pie for everyone.    At the same time, easy money has juiced up the value of stocks, bonds and other financial assets, which benefits mainly the rich, inflaming social resentment over growing inequalities in income and wealth. It should not be surprising that millennials and Gen Z are growing disillusioned with this distorted form of capitalism and say that they prefer socialism. The irony is that the rising culture of government dependence is, in fact, a form of socialism -- for the rich and powerful.    What capitalism urgently needs is a new, more focused approach to government intervention -- one that will ease the pain of disasters but leave economies free to grow on their own after the crises pass.    In the early 1980s, central banks started to win the \"war\" on double-digit inflation. Containing consumer prices allowed them to start pushing interest rates downward, at a time when financial deregulation was easing lending conditions and corporate bailouts were becoming standard practice.    The Fed intervened in the markets to counter the crash of 1987 and in 1998 organized the rescue of a specific financial firm, Long Term Capital Management, for the first time. In 2008 the Treasury stepped in to save an entire sector -- banks at the core of the mortgage crisis -- with $200 billion. Unable to do much more to cut rates, which were already close to zero, the Fed launched its first experiments in \"quantitative easing,\" buying up to tens of billions of dollars in assets each day, including mortgage-backed securities, to calm the credit markets.    The rest of the world followed the Fed. As interest rates fell toward zero, the world's debts -- including households, governments and nonfinancial companies -- more than tripled between 1980 and 2007 to more than three times the size of the global economy. It was taking more debt to fuel the same amount of growth, because more debt was going to unproductive borrowers. Capitalism was bogging down.    Worldwide, recessions were decreasing in frequency and severity. In the 2010s, as easy money continued to flow from central banks, the global economy staged a recovery that was unusual for its length but also for its frustratingly slow pace of growth and for how few nations were allowed to suffer a moment's pain. In 2017 -- many years into its recovery -- the U.S. pushed through a large tax cut to stimulate growth.    By 2019, only 7% of the nearly 200 economies tracked by the International Monetary Fund were in recession, and only 3% were expected to fall into recession in 2020 -- near a record low. As governments stepped in to do whatever it took to eliminate recessions, downturns no longer purged the economy of inefficient companies, and recoveries have grown weaker and weaker, with lower productivity growth.    What has happened during the pandemic is the story of the last four decades, telescoped into a matter of weeks and magnified to previously unimaginable scale.    Four months after the market crashed amid warnings that lockdowns would trigger another Great Depression, governments have intervened as never before. Many rich countries have rolled out stimulus measures amounting to 10% of GDP or more. That means an even bigger role for government, which will have to be funded by more debt.    After the global financial crisis of 2008, households and financial firms in many capitalist countries felt pressure to restrain their borrowing. Governments did not. The world's total debt burden plateaued at a historical high of 320% of global GDP by the end of 2019, but within that total, government debt rose most rapidly. Many economists swatted away concerns about higher government debt arguing that with interest rates so low the borrowing could be easily financed.    The problem is that growing government involvement in the economy typically leads to lower productivity and weaker growth. A 2011 European Central Bank working paper found a \"significant negative effect\" of bigger government on per capita GDP growth in a set of 108 countries over the previous four decades. A recent report from BCA Research found a similar link in 28 major developed economies, including the U.S., over the last two decades.    The idea of government as the balm for all crises is appealing in the short term, but it ignores the unintended consequences. Without entrepreneurial risk and creative destruction, capitalism doesn't work. Disruption and regeneration, the heart of the system, grind to a halt. The deadwood never falls from the tree. The green shoots are nipped in the bud.    Low interest rates are supposed to encourage investment in companies large and small, increasing productivity and boosting growth. Instead, as a recent paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research shows, low rates gave big companies a strategic incentive to grow even bigger, in large part because securing a dominant position in the market promises outsize financial rewards.    The big were growing bigger for many reasons, of course. The rise of the internet created a winner-take-all market, in which dominant giants could reach every consumer on the planet. Government regulations, which expanded at an accelerating rate over the past four decades, created a thicket of rules best navigated by big companies with armies of lobbyists and lawyers.    The big tech companies, in particular, came to sit on tens of billions in cash, much of which they used to buy back their own stock -- hardly a productive investment in the future of the economy. As the large grew increasingly entrenched, they sucked up talent and resources, crowding out the little guys.    Startups represent a declining share of all companies in the U.S. and many other industrialized economies. Before the pandemic, the U.S. was generating startups -- and shutting down established companies -- at the slowest rates since at least the 1970s. The number of publicly traded U.S. companies had fallen by nearly half, to around 4,400, since the peak in 1996. And many of them started running up massive debts, in part as a desperate effort to grow in the shadow of the giants.    Today an astonishing number of the survivors are, quite literally, creatures of credit. In the 1980s, only 2% of publicly traded companies in the U.S. were considered \"zombies,\" a term used by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for companies that, over the previous three years, had not earned enough profit to make even the interest payments on their debt. The zombie minority started to grow rapidly in the early 2000s, and by the eve of the pandemic, accounted for 19% of U.S.-listed companies. Zombies are also spreading in Europe, China and of course Japan, where this phenomenon first became apparent.    With every crisis, more of these creatures of debt survive. Since the 1980s, recent Deutsche Bank research shows, each new U.S. recession has been met with more bailouts and easy money, leading to a lower rate of corporate defaults. Over the last 20 years, the falling default rate has also closely mirrored the slowdown in U.S. productivity, which is not surprising.    Keeping profitless companies alive naturally retards productivity. A 2017 OECD study found, for example, that \"zombie congestion\" in any industry lowers the productivity of rival companies -- and blocks the entry of new companies -- by raising labor costs and making it difficult to attract capital. Now forecasters expect companies with junk debt ratings to default at a rate of around 10% during the pandemic -- a rate lower than in recent recessions, despite the historic depth and speed of the current contraction.    As lockdowns began in March, the Fed promised to start buying debt at a rate up to twice as fast as in 2008, including corporate bonds for the first time. Gradually, the Fed has loosened the definition of what it will buy. Even after the credit markets had settled down in June, the Fed ramped up purchases, and it now owns debt issued by, among others, Apple, Walmart, AT&amp;T, Disney, Nike and Berkshire Hathaway.    The question is how much further capitalism will be deformed by government intervention on this scale. When the government is willing to buy just about anything, it distorts market prices, which normally guide people to buy into profitable, promising companies. Now investors are simply buying what the Fed buys. The process of competitive capital allocation, which is critical to raising productivity, has broken down.    Governments also rescue fellow governments as quickly as they bail out domestic companies. The amount of sovereign debt that is currently in default is close to a record low. The result is that even nations with checkered credit records can sell bonds offering improbably low returns. Cyprus, which was bailed out in 2013, recently issued new 20-year debt at a yield of just over 1% -- suggesting investors are confident that if Cyprus falters again, other governments will step in to save it. Policy makers fear that with global debt levels already very high, even one default could set off a contagion and bring down this increasingly fragile house of cards.    In a way, much of the world is following the path of Japan, which pioneered central bank purchases of corporate debt in response to the market crash of 1990, then kept those companies on debt support indefinitely. Japan's public debts have since quadrupled to 240% of gross domestic product, weighing on growth and even discouraging young people from having children in a debt-soaked and dysfunctional economy.    But Japan's mistakes also point the way forward. The issue is not rescue efforts during a crisis -- the soundness of that strategy was demonstrated during the Great Depression and has been reaffirmed many times since. It is how that money is spent -- productively or not -- and whether rescues turn into endless easy money and constant stimulus, through good times and bad.    Germany is the rare model of a government that still saves during the good times. In response to the eurozone crisis of 2010, Germany increased public spending and debt, but as the crisis ebbed, it shut off the spigot. While public debt was still rising in the U.S. and Japan, it was shrinking in Germany from 80% of GDP to 60% on the eve of the pandemic.    Germany had a government surplus and could afford one of the most generous stimulus packages in the world when the pandemic hit. Germany's public debt will rise again, but according to the IMF, to a level that will still be much lower than any other big industrialized economy. The government has also targeted billions in new stimulus spending for startups in artificial intelligence and other technologies that could lift slumping productivity, which is a global phenomena. Because central banks move as a pack, borrowing is cheap world-wide, and even Germany has a horde of unproductive zombie companies.    Governments need to recognize that constant intervention to prop up the economy and financial markets is not achieving its intended purpose. After 2008, the Fed and the Treasury were praised to the moon for \"saving the world,\" but the Fed's \"experimental\" forays into quantitative easing continued long after the crisis was over. The widespread assumption that the recovery would have been even weaker without Fed support ignores the mounting evidence that its interventions are doing more to boost the stock market than the real economy.    The Fed insists it is fulfilling its mandate so long as easy money is not stoking consumer price inflation, and at least so far, it is not. But that mandate is too narrow, because easy money is instead inflating stock and bond prices, encouraging inefficient firms to take on more debt and seeding financial instability.    When the pandemic passes, authorities need to shift out of rescue mode and start weaning capitalism off easy money and bailouts. They have to recognize how heavy government intervention is distorting the price signals that make free markets efficient in allocating capital. Otherwise, they will continue creating more zombies and monopolies, widening inequality, undermining productivity and slowing growth. For all their good intentions, they will continue to feed the dysfunction that is alienating younger generations and deforming capitalism.

She has bandaged it with clear packing tape and plans to use the phone until it disintegrates. She objects to the planned obsolescence of today's gadgetry, and to the way the big tech companies pressure customers to upgrade. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taylor, 36, is a documentary filmmaker, musician and political activist. She's also an emerging star in the world of technology criticism. She's not paranoid, but she keeps duct tape over the camera lens on her laptop computer - because, as everyone knows, these gadgets can be taken over by nefarious agents of all kinds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taylor is a 21st-century digital dissenter. She's one of the many technophiles unhappy about the way the tech revolution has played out. Political progressives once embraced the utopian promise of the Internet as a democratizing force, but they've been dismayed by the rise of the \"surveillance state,\" and the near-monopolization of digital platforms by huge corporations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, Taylor and more than 1,000 activists, scholars and techies gathered at the New School in New York City for a conference to talk about reinventing the Internet. They dream of a co-op model: people dealing directly with one another without having to go through a data-sucking corporate hub.</p><p>\"The powerful definitely do not want us to reboot things, and they will go to great lengths to stop us from doing so, and they will use brute force or they will use bureaucracy,\" Taylor warned the conferees at the close of the two-day session.</p><p>We need a movement, she said, \"that says no to the existing order.\"          </p><p>The dissenters have no easy task. We're in a new Machine Age. Machine intelligence and digital social networks are now embedded in the basic infrastructure of the developed world.</p><p>Much of this is objectively good and pleasurable and empowering. We tend to like our devices, our social media, our computer games. We like our connectivity. We like being able to know nearly anything and everything, or shop impulsively, by typing a few words into a search engine.</p><p>But there's this shadow narrative being written at the same time. It's a passionate, if still remarkably disorganized, resistance to the digital establishment. </p><p>Techno-skeptics, or whatever you want to call them - \"humanists\" may be the best term - sense that human needs are getting lost in the tech frenzy, that the priorities have been turned upside down. They sense that there's too much focus on making sure that new innovations will be good for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">machines</emphasis>.</p><p>\"I'm on Team Human!\" author Douglas Rushkoff will say at the conclusion of a talk.</p><p>You could fill a college syllabus with books espousing some kind of technological resistance. Start the class with \"You Are Not a Gadget\" (Jaron Lanier), move on to \"The Internet Is Not the Answer\" (Andrew Keen), and then, to scare the students silly, \"Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era\" (James Barrat).</p><p>Somewhere in the mix should be Astra Taylor's \"The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age,\" a clear-eyed reappraisal of the Internet and new media.</p><p>Of the myriad critiques of the computer culture, one of the most common is that companies are getting rich off our personal data. Our thoughts, friendships and basic urges are processed by computer algorithms and sold to advertisers. The machines may soon know more about us than we know about ourselves.</p><p>That information is valuable. A frequent gibe is that on Facebook, we're not the customers, we're the merchandise. Or to put it another way: If the service is free, you're the product.</p><p>Some digital dissenters aren't focused on the economic issues, but simply on the nature of human-machine interactions. This is an issue we all understand intuitively: We're constantly distracted. We walk around with our eyes cast down upon our devices. We're rarely fully present anywhere.</p><p>Other critics are alarmed by the erosion of privacy. The Edward Snowden revelations incited widespread fear of government surveillance. That debate has been complicated by the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, because national security officials say terrorists have exploited new types of encrypted social media.</p><p>Some dissenters think technology is driving economic inequality. There are grave concerns that robots are taking the jobs of humans. And the robot issue leads inevitably to the most apocalyptic fear: that machine intelligence could run away from its human inventors, leaving us enslaved - or worse - by the machines we created.</p><p>          Moving rapidly          </p><p>Technological skepticism isn't new. Plato told the story of a king who protested the invention of writing, saying it would weaken his people's memory and \"implant forgetfulness in their souls.\"</p><p>But something different is going on now, and it simply has to do with speed. The first commercial Internet browser hit the market in 1994. Google arrived in 1998. Twitter appeared in 2006, and the iPhone in 2007. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is all of 31 years old.</p><p>Our technology today is so new that we haven't had time to understand how to use it wisely. We haven't quite learned how to stop ourselves from texting and driving; many of us are tempted to tap out one more letter even if we're going 75 on the highway.</p><p>Some countries are taking aggressive action to regulate new technologies. The South Korean government has decided that gaming is so addictive that it should be treated similarly to a drug or alcohol problem. Meanwhile, the European Union law \"Right to Be Forgotten\" forces companies such as Google and Yahoo to remove embarrassing material from search engine results if requested to do so.</p><p>Washington's political establishment, however, has largely deferred to Silicon Valley. The tech world skews libertarian and doesn't want more government oversight and regulations.</p><p>One of the tech world's top advocates in Washington is Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation, which receives about two-thirds of its funding from tech companies.</p><p>Atkinson is a lanky, voluble man who sounds exasperated by the rise in what he considers to be neo-Luddite thinking. (\"Luddite\" is a term dating to the early 19th century, named for a murky character named Ned Ludd, who inspired textile workers to smash mechanical looms.)</p><p>He's worried that books by people such as Astra Taylor will create a thought contagion that will infect Washington policymaking. In his view, there are two types of Luddites: the old-fashioned hand-wringers who are spooked by anything new and innovative; and the \"soft\" Luddites - he would put Taylor in that category - who say they embrace technology but want to go slower, with more European-style regulations.</p><p>\"It's the emergence of soft Luddites that I worry about, because it has become the elite conventional wisdom in a lot of spaces,\" Atkinson said.</p><p>But he may be worried prematurely. A Senate bill to regulate self-driving cars went precisely nowhere. It's not as though people are marching on Washington to demand that lawmakers address the self-driving-car threat.</p><p>          Fact in fiction          </p><p>The technological resistance is not limited to nonfiction polemics. Fiction writers are picking up the thread, often borrowing from George Orwell and his dystopian masterpiece, \"1984.\"</p><p>For example, Gary Shteyngart's \"Super Sad True Love Story\" is a tale of people struggling to find love and humanity in a world of Big Brother-like surveillance, societal breakdown and increasingly coarse social norms. The novel features gadgets that allow people to rate one another numerically on their sexual attractiveness. Not implausible: A start-up company recently announced its plan to market an app that would allow users to rate everyone on a 1-to-5 scale, without their consent. (After furious protest from around the Internet, the backers modified their plan to include only positive reviews.)</p><p>Dave Eggers's novel \"The Circle\" tells of a rising star at a Google-like company. She excels by answering thousands of e-mails a day, working at a frenetic pace. She lives with a camera around her neck that streams everything she sees onto the Internet. This does not go well for her.</p><p>And there's a new voice among the dissenters: Pope Francis. The pontiff's recent encyclical \"On Care for Our Common Home\" contemplates the mixed blessings of technology. After acknowledging the marvels of modern technology (\"Who can deny the beauty of an aircraft or a skyscraper?\"), Francis sketched the dangers, writing that technological development hasn't been matched by development in human values and conscience.</p><p>\"The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings,\" he wrote.</p><p>The pontiff is saying, with his special authority, what many others are saying these days: Machines are not an end unto themselves. Remember the humans.</p><p>          Becoming a dissenter          </p><p>The dean of the digital dissenters is Jaron Lanier. He's a musician, composer, performer and pioneer of virtual-reality headsets that allow the user to experience computer-generated 3D environments. But what he's most famous for is his criticism of the computer culture he helped create.</p><p>He believes that Silicon Valley treats humans like electrical relays in a vast machine. Although he still works in technology, he largely has turned against his tribe.</p><p>\"I'm the first guy to sober up after a heavy-duty party\" is how he describes himself.</p><p>He can typically be found at home in California's Berkeley Hills, swiveling in a chair in front of a computer screen and a musical synthesizer. Directly behind him is a vintage Wurlitzer golden harp. Lutes and violins hang from the ceiling. This is his home office and man cave.</p><p>Lanier, 55, is a man of considerable girth and extraordinary hair. He has dreadlocks to his waist. He hasn't cut his hair for at least 30 years and says he wouldn't know how to go about it. When a visitor suggests that he could see a barber, he replies, in his usual high-pitched, singsong voice: \"I don't know that term. Is that a new start-up?\"</p><p>Lanier's humanistic take on technology may trace back to his tragic childhood: He was 9 when his mother was killed in a car accident in El Paso. He later learned that the accident may have been caused by an engineering flaw in the car.</p><p>\"It definitely influenced my thinking about the proper relationship of people and machines,\" he said.</p><p>By age 14, he was taking college classes at New Mexico State University. He never graduated from college, which didn't matter when he wound up in Silicon Valley, designing computer games. He eventually started a company that sold virtual-reality headsets, but the company folded. In 2000, he made his first major move as a digital dissenter when he published an essay, \"One Half a Manifesto,\" that began with a bold declaration:</p><p>\"For the last twenty years, I have found myself on the inside of a revolution, but on the outside of its resplendent dogma. Now that the revolution has not only hit the mainstream, but bludgeoned it into submission by taking over the economy, it's probably time for me to cry out my dissent more loudly than I have before.\"</p><p>Lanier later wrote two books lamenting the way everyone essentially works for Facebook, Google, etc., by feeding material into those central processors and turning private lives into something corporations can monetize. He'd like to see people compensated for their data in the form of micropayments.</p><p>Other tech critics have rolled their eyes at that notion, however. Taylor, for example, fears that micropayments would create an incentive for people to post click-bait material. Stupid stunts - \"Hold my beer, and watch this\" - would be potentially marketable.</p><p>Lanier's broadest argument is that technological change involves choices. Bad decisions will lock us into bad systems. We collectively decided, for example, to trade our privacy for free Internet service.</p><p>\"It's a choice. It's not inevitable,\" he says.</p><p>Lanier told his 8-year-old daughter recently: \"In our society there are two paths to success: One is to be good at computers and the other is to be a sociopath.\"</p><p>She's a smart girl and knows what \"sociopath\" means, he said. And he understands the nature of this world that he has helped invent.

They feel as though the idea was stolen from them and perverted into something that hurts workers.</p><p>They say that companies such as Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit and Amazon Mechanical Turk are creating a \"gig economy\" - one that, although it offers customers convenience and reasonable prices, is built on freelancers and contractors who lack the income or job protections of salaried employees. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, an investor in Uber and Airbnb, owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>\"What was billed as 'sharing' was actually 'extraction,' \" said Nathan Schneider, a journalist and co-organizer of the recent New School conference on cooperative platforms. \"It's revealed to be a way of shirking labor laws and extracting resources back to investors and building monopolies.\"</p><p>He was speaking at a reception at the end of the two-day conference. The event was a huge success, with attentive audiences packing the panel discussions. These people are committed to reinventing the Internet.</p><p>\"The story of the Internet has been one of disappointment after disappointment,\" Schneider said. </p><p>As Schneider spoke, Astra Taylor stood a few feet away, holding court with friends and allies. Taylor is tall, with striking features that give her a commanding presence. She was born to be a tech critic. She wasn't home-schooled, she was \"unschooled.\" Her parents in Athens, Ga., put her in charge of her education. At age 13, she created her own newspaper with an environmentalist bent. She burned with a sense of right and wrong. \"I was a serious child,\" she says, persuasively.</p><p>She says she'd like to see more government-supported media platforms - think public radio - and more robust regulations to keep digital powerhouses from becoming monopolies.  Taylor is skeptical of the trope that information wants to be free; actually, she says, information often wants someone to pay for it.</p><p>The Internet, she said, is a bit like a friend who needs to be straightened out. She imagines giving the Internet a talking-to: \"You know, Internet, we've known you for a long time and we think you're not living up to your potential. You keep making the same mistakes.\"</p><p>The final event at the New School conference featured a stemwinder of a talk by someone Taylor considers a mentor: Douglas (\"I'm on Team Human!\") Rushkoff.</p><p>Rushkoff, whose upcoming book is titled \"Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus,\" provided a primer on the rise of capitalism, central banks and industrial culture. He suggested that civilization started making wrong turns in the Middle Ages. Centralized currency - not good. In the early days, every community could have its own coinage. We need to \"rebirth the values of the peer-to-peer bazaar culture.\"</p><p>Growing louder and more animated as his lecture went on, he talked about the need to \"optimize the economy for humans.\"</p><p>\"Where do humans fit into this new economy?\" he said. \"Really not as creators of value, but as the content. We are the content. We are the data. We are the media. As you use a smartphone, your smartphone gets smarter, but you get dumber.\"</p><p>Taylor, Rushkoff, Lanier and other tech skeptics do not yet form an organized, coherent movement. They're more like a confederation of gadflies. Even Pope Francis's thoughts on technology were largely lost amid his headline-grabbing views about climate change.</p><p>Andrew Keen, author of \"The Internet is Not the Answer,\" sounds a glum note when talking about what the technological resistance might accomplish.</p><p>\"No one's ever heard of Astra Taylor,\" he said.</p><p>He didn't mean that as an insult. He was making a point about the whole crew of dissenters. No one, he said, has ever heard of Andrew Keen, either.</p><p>The world is not about to go back to the Stone Age, at least not willingly. One billion people may use Facebook on any given day. Jaron Lanier may not like the way the big companies scrape value from our lives, but people are participating in that system willingly - if perhaps not entirely aware of what is happening to their data.</p><p>Taylor's smartphone with the cracked screen clearly has been in heavy use. She knows these gadgets are addictive by design - \"like Las Vegas slot machines in our pockets.\" But she also has trouble living without one.</p><p>\"I need to learn to turn it off,\" she said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:joel.achenbach@washpost.com\">joel.achenbach@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-e83cf658617a11e58e9edce8a2a2a679</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HPV-7BM1-JCDY-T2G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2924\"/><timeReceived>5:38 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>December 27, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00098PQ</classCode><className>CURRICULA</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUZCQjQ2OEI4MzZFNDE5NUE4MTczNEQwRjEwQzE3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRGMkI4ODIzRjgxNEE2RkE2OEE5MTU0MDdFM0Y5RjI</classCode><className>Curriculum</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST0009P2M</classCode><className>URBAN SCHOOLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp;

She has bandaged it with clear packing tape and plans to use the phone until it disintegrates. She objects to the planned obsolescence of today's gadgetry, and to the way the big tech companies pressure customers to upgrade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taylor, 36, is a documentary filmmaker, musician and political activist. She's also an emerging star in the world of technology criticism. She's not paranoid, but she keeps duct tape over the camera lens on her laptop computer - because, as everyone knows, these gadgets can be taken over by nefarious agents of all kinds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taylor is a 21st-century digital dissenter. She's one of the many technophiles unhappy about the way the tech revolution has played out. Political progressives once embraced the utopian promise of the Internet as a democratizing force, but they've been dismayed by the rise of the \"surveillance state,\" and the near-monopolization of digital platforms by huge corporations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, Taylor and more than 1,000 activists, scholars and techies gathered at the New School in New York City for a conference to talk about reinventing the Internet. They dream of a co-op model: people dealing directly with one another without having to go through a data-sucking corporate hub.</p><p>\"The powerful definitely do not want us to reboot things, and they will go to great lengths to stop us from doing so, and they will use brute force or they will use bureaucracy,\" Taylor warned the conferees at the close of the two-day session.</p><p>We need a movement, she said, \"that says no to the existing order.\"</p><p>The dissenters have no easy task. We're in a new Machine Age. Machine intelligence and digital social networks are now embedded in the basic infrastructure of the developed world.</p><p>Much of this is objectively good and pleasurable and empowering. We tend to like our devices, our social media, our computer games. We like our connectivity. We like being able to know nearly anything and everything, or shop impulsively, by typing a few words into a search engine.</p><p>But there's this shadow narrative being written at the same time. It's a passionate, if still remarkably disorganized, resistance to the digital establishment.</p><p>Techno-skeptics, or whatever you want to call them - \"humanists\" may be the best term - sense that human needs are getting lost in the tech frenzy, that the priorities have been turned upside down. They sense that there's too much focus on making sure that new innovations will be good for the  machines .</p><p>\"I'm on Team Human!\" author Douglas Rushkoff will say at the conclusion of a talk.</p><p>You could fill a college syllabus with books espousing some kind of technological resistance. Start the class with \"You Are Not a Gadget\" (Jaron Lanier), move on to \"The Internet Is Not the Answer\" (Andrew Keen), and then, to scare the students silly, \"Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era\" (James Barrat).</p><p>Somewhere in the mix should be Astra Taylor's \"The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age,\" a clear-eyed reappraisal of the Internet and new media.</p><p>Of the myriad critiques of the computer culture, one of the most common is that companies are getting rich off our personal data. Our thoughts, friendships and basic urges are processed by computer algorithms and sold to advertisers. The machines may soon know more about us than we know about ourselves.</p><p>That information is valuable. A frequent gibe is that on Facebook, we're not the customers, we're the merchandise. Or to put it another way: If the service is free, you're the product.</p><p>Some digital dissenters aren't focused on the economic issues, but simply on the nature of human-machine interactions. This is an issue we all understand intuitively: We're constantly distracted. We walk around with our eyes cast down upon our devices. We're rarely fully present anywhere.</p><p>Other critics are alarmed by the erosion of privacy. The Edward Snowden revelations incited widespread fear of government surveillance. That debate has been complicated by the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, because national security officials say terrorists have exploited new types of encrypted social media.</p><p>Some dissenters think technology is driving economic inequality. There are grave concerns that robots are taking the jobs of humans. And the robot issue leads inevitably to the most apocalyptic fear: that machine intelligence could run away from its human inventors, leaving us enslaved - or worse - by the machines we created.</p><h>Moving rapidly</h><p>Technological skepticism isn't new. Plato told the story of a king who protested the invention of writing, saying it would weaken his people's memory and \"implant forgetfulness in their souls.\"</p><p>But something different is going on now, and it simply has to do with speed. The first commercial Internet browser hit the market in 1994. Google arrived in 1998. Twitter appeared in 2006, and the iPhone in 2007. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is all of 31 years old.</p><p>Our technology today is so new that we haven't had time to understand how to use it wisely. We haven't quite learned how to stop ourselves from texting and driving; many of us are tempted to tap out one more letter even if we're going 75 on the highway.</p><p>Some countries are taking aggressive action to regulate new technologies. The South Korean government has decided that gaming is so addictive that it should be treated similarly to a drug or alcohol problem. Meanwhile, the European Union law \"Right to Be Forgotten\" forces companies such as Google and Yahoo to remove embarrassing material from search engine results if requested to do so.</p><p>Washington's political establishment, however, has largely deferred to Silicon Valley. The tech world skews libertarian and doesn't want more government oversight and regulations.</p><p>One of the tech world's top advocates in Washington is Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation, which receives about two-thirds of its funding from tech companies.</p><p>Atkinson is a lanky, voluble man who sounds exasperated by the rise in what he considers to be neo-Luddite thinking. (\"Luddite\" is a term dating to the early 19th century, named for a murky character named Ned Ludd, who inspired textile workers to smash mechanical looms.)</p><p>He's worried that books by people such as Astra Taylor will create a thought contagion that will infect Washington policymaking. In his view, there are two types of Luddites: the old-fashioned hand-wringers who are spooked by anything new and innovative; and the \"soft\" Luddites - he would put Taylor in that category - who say they embrace technology but want to go slower, with more European-style regulations.</p><p>\"It's the emergence of soft Luddites that I worry about, because it has become the elite conventional wisdom in a lot of spaces,\" Atkinson said.</p><p>But he may be worried prematurely. A Senate bill to regulate self-driving cars went precisely nowhere. It's not as though people are marching on Washington to demand that lawmakers address the self-driving-car threat.</p><h>Fact in fiction</h><p>The technological resistance is not limited to nonfiction polemics. Fiction writers are picking up the thread, often borrowing from George Orwell and his dystopian masterpiece, \"1984.\"</p><p>For example, Gary Shteyngart's \"Super Sad True Love Story\" is a tale of people struggling to find love and humanity in a world of Big Brother-like surveillance, societal breakdown and increasingly coarse social norms. The novel features gadgets that allow people to rate one another numerically on their sexual attractiveness. Not implausible: A start-up company recently announced its plan to market an app that would allow users to rate everyone on a 1-to-5 scale, without their consent. (After furious protest from around the Internet, the backers modified their plan to include only positive reviews.)</p><p>Dave Eggers's novel \"The Circle\" tells of a rising star at a Google-like company. She excels by answering thousands of e-mails a day, working at a frenetic pace. She lives with a camera around her neck that streams everything she sees onto the Internet. This does not go well for her.</p><p>And there's a new voice among the dissenters: Pope Francis. The pontiff's recent encyclical \"On Care for Our Common Home\" contemplates the mixed blessings of technology. After acknowledging the marvels of modern technology (\"Who can deny the beauty of an aircraft or a skyscraper?\"), Francis sketched the dangers, writing that technological development hasn't been matched by development in human values and conscience.</p><p>\"The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings,\" he wrote.</p><p>The pontiff is saying, with his special authority, what many others are saying these days: Machines are not an end unto themselves. Remember the humans.</p><h>Becoming a dissenter</h><p>The dean of the digital dissenters is Jaron Lanier. He's a musician, composer, performer and pioneer of virtual-reality headsets that allow the user to experience computer-generated 3D environments. But what he's most famous for is his criticism of the computer culture he helped create.</p><p>He believes that Silicon Valley treats humans like electrical relays in a vast machine. Although he still works in technology, he largely has turned against his tribe.</p><p>\"I'm the first guy to sober up after a heavy-duty party\" is how he describes himself.</p><p>He can typically be found at home in California's Berkeley Hills, swiveling in a chair in front of a computer screen and a musical synthesizer. Directly behind him is a vintage Wurlitzer golden harp. Lutes and violins hang from the ceiling. This is his home office and man cave.</p><p>Lanier, 55, is a man of considerable girth and extraordinary hair. He has dreadlocks to his waist. He hasn't cut his hair for at least 30 years and says he wouldn't know how to go about it. When a visitor suggests that he could see a barber, he replies, in his usual high-pitched, singsong voice: \"I don't know that term. Is that a new start-up?\"</p><p>Lanier's humanistic take on technology may trace back to his tragic childhood: He was 9 when his mother was killed in a car accident in El Paso. He later learned that the accident may have been caused by an engineering flaw in the car.</p><p>\"It definitely influenced my thinking about the proper relationship of people and machines,\" he said.</p><p>By age 14, he was taking college classes at New Mexico State University. He never graduated from college, which didn't matter when he wound up in Silicon Valley, designing computer games. He eventually started a company that sold virtual-reality headsets, but the company folded. In 2000, he made his first major move as a digital dissenter when he published an essay, \"One Half a Manifesto,\" that began with a bold declaration:</p><p>\"For the last twenty years, I have found myself on the inside of a revolution, but on the outside of its resplendent dogma. Now that the revolution has not only hit the mainstream, but bludgeoned it into submission by taking over the economy, it's probably time for me to cry out my dissent more loudly than I have before.\"</p><p>Lanier later wrote two books lamenting the way everyone essentially works for Facebook, Google, etc., by feeding material into those central processors and turning private lives into something corporations can monetize. He'd like to see people compensated for their data in the form of micropayments.</p><p>Other tech critics have rolled their eyes at that notion, however. Taylor, for example, fears that micropayments would create an incentive for people to post click-bait material. Stupid stunts - \"Hold my beer, and watch this\" - would be potentially marketable.</p><p>Lanier's broadest argument is that technological change involves choices. Bad decisions will lock us into bad systems. We collectively decided, for example, to trade our privacy for free Internet service.</p><p>\"It's a choice. It's not inevitable,\" he says.</p><p>Lanier told his 8-year-old daughter recently: \"In our society there are two paths to success: One is to be good at computers and the other is to be a sociopath.\"</p><p>She's a smart girl and knows what \"sociopath\" means, he said. And he understands the nature of this world that he has helped invent. That's why this summer he sent his daughter to a software programming camp.</p><h>No coherent movement</h><p>Much of today's tech environment emerged from the counterculture - the hackers and hippies of the 1960s and '70s who viewed the personal computer as a tool of liberation. But the political left now has a more complicated, jaundiced relationship with the digital world.</p><p>The same technologies that empower individuals and enable protesters to organize also make it possible for governments to spy on their citizens. What used to be a phone now looks to many people like a tracking device.</p><p>Then there's the question of who's making money. Progressives are appalled by the mind-boggling profits of the big tech companies. The left also takes note of the gender and racial disparities in the tech companies, and the rise of a techno-elite.</p><p>Most painful for progressives has been the rise of the \"sharing economy,\" which they initially embraced. They feel as though the idea was stolen from them and perverted into something that hurts workers.</p><p>They say that companies such as Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit and Amazon Mechanical Turk are creating a \"gig economy\" - one that, although it offers customers convenience and reasonable prices, is built on freelancers and contractors who lack the income or job protections of salaried employees. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, an investor in Uber and Airbnb, owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>\"What was billed as 'sharing' was actually 'extraction,' \" said Nathan Schneider, a journalist and co-organizer of the recent New School conference on cooperative platforms. \"It's revealed to be a way of shirking labor laws and extracting resources back to investors and building monopolies.\"</p><p>He was speaking at a reception at the end of the two-day conference. The event was a huge success, with attentive audiences packing the panel discussions. These people are committed to reinventing the Internet.</p><p>\"The story of the Internet has been one of disappointment after disappointment,\" Schneider said.</p><p>As Schneider spoke, Astra Taylor stood a few feet away, holding court with friends and allies. Taylor is tall, with striking features that give her a commanding presence. She was born to be a tech critic. She wasn't home-schooled, she was \"unschooled.\" Her parents in Athens, Ga., put her in charge of her education. At age 13, she created her own newspaper with an environmentalist bent. She burned with a sense of right and wrong. \"I was a serious child,\" she says, persuasively.</p><p>She says she'd like to see more government-supported media platforms - think public radio - and more robust regulations to keep digital powerhouses from becoming monopolies.  Taylor is skeptical of the trope that information wants to be free; actually, she says, information often wants someone to pay for it.</p><p>The Internet, she said, is a bit like a friend who needs to be straightened out. She imagines giving the Internet a talking-to: \"You know, Internet, we've known you for a long time and we think you're not living up to your potential. You keep making the same mistakes.\"</p><p>The final event at the New School conference featured a stemwinder of a talk by someone Taylor considers a mentor: Douglas (\"I'm on Team Human!\") Rushkoff.</p><p>Rushkoff, whose upcoming book is titled \"Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus,\" provided a primer on the rise of capitalism, central banks and industrial culture. He suggested that civilization started making wrong turns in the Middle Ages. Centralized currency - not good. In the early days, every community could have its own coinage. We need to \"rebirth the values of the peer-to-peer bazaar culture.\"</p><p>Growing louder and more animated as his lecture went on, he talked about the need to \"optimize the economy for humans.\"</p><p>\"Where do humans fit into this new economy?\" he said. \"Really not as creators of value, but as the content. We are the content. We are the data. We are the media. As you use a smartphone, your smartphone gets smarter, but you get dumber.\"</p><p>Taylor, Rushkoff, Lanier and other tech skeptics do not yet form an organized, coherent movement. They're more like a confederation of gadflies. Even Pope Francis's thoughts on technology were largely lost amid his headline-grabbing views about climate change.</p><p>Andrew Keen, author of \"The Internet is Not the Answer,\" sounds a glum note when talking about what the technological resistance might accomplish.</p><p>\"No one's ever heard of Astra Taylor,\" he said.</p><p>He didn't mean that as an insult. He was making a point about the whole crew of dissenters. No one, he said, has ever heard of Andrew Keen, either.</p><p>The world is not about to go back to the Stone Age, at least not willingly. One billion people may use Facebook on any given day. Jaron Lanier may not like the way the big companies scrape value from our lives, but people are participating in that system willingly - if perhaps not entirely aware of what is happening to their data.</p><p>Taylor's smartphone with the cracked screen clearly has been in heavy use. She knows these gadgets are addictive by design - \"like Las Vegas slot machines in our pockets.\" But she also has trouble living without one.</p><p>\"I need to learn to turn it off,\" she said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:joel.achenbach@washpost.com\">joel.achenbach@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-e83cf658-617a-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HPN-YDG1-JBFW-C1TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2909\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Met 2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>December 27, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00098PQ</classCode><className>CURRICULA</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUZCQjQ2OEI4MzZFNDE5NUE4MTczNEQwRjEwQzE3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRGMkI4ODIzRjgxNEE2RkE2OEE5MTU0MDdFM0Y5RjI</classCode><className>Curriculum</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST0009P2M</classCode><className>URBAN SCHOOLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp;

One company dominates online retail. Two ride-hailing companies dictate wages for hundreds of thousands of drivers. In agriculture, two chemical companies control the market for the most important seeds and have the leverage to gouge farmers. This is why a number of Democratic presidential contenders, including Bernie Sanders on the left and Amy Klobuchar in the center, have vowed to act against concentrated corporate power. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's Department of Justice has initiated investigations of big tech companies. If federal agencies start busting up monopolies, halting big corporate mergers, and stopping predatory practices, the two of us would enthusiastically welcome the government's new vigor.</p><p><br/>But government agencies like the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission shouldn't be the only check on corporate power. The other, equally vital way to keep monopolies and near-monopolies in check is to build up the power of everyone else in the economy-the workers and small-business owners who, in making their livelihoods, must interact with ever-larger corporate giants. Especially when regulators stand down, ordinary people have to be able to join forces and create unions and cooperatives that could hold the largest corporations in check. But all too often, American laws-including, ironically, antitrust laws-put up barriers to this kind of collective power.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/amazon-cancels-new-yorks-hq2and-thats-a-good-thing/582844/?utm_source=feed\">Derek Thompson: Amazon got exactly what it deserved-and so did New York</url>]<br/>You might think of antitrust law, which led to the breakup of Standard Oil and AT&amp;amp;T, as applying primarily to giant corporations. Yet the same set of laws also prevents some of the weakest players in the economy from finding their strength. A corporate cartel whose members set artificially high prices for goods is illegal under long-standing antitrust rules, but so are groups of powerless independent contractors-Uber drivers, home health-care providers, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2018/independent-contractors-made-up-6-point-9-percent-of-employment-in-may-2017.htm\">millions of other workers</url>-or small firms banding together to compete on fairer terms. Indeed, while antitrust enforcers have done little or nothing to check the power of corporate monopolies and stop consolidation, they have attacked the collective action of workers and small firms as illegal collusion. Promoting a rebalancing of power in the economy will require not just more antitrust enforcement against big corporations but a reorientation of antitrust.<br/>Antitrust law should distinguish between huge companies and economic minnows. And collective power-that is, allowing independent workers and small businesses to collaborate to negotiate better treatment from megacorporations, or to start enterprises of their own-should be a pillar of creating an equitable economy.<br/>Workers in traditional employment relationships have an antitrust exemption for some of their concerted activities. That's how labor unions became synonymous with collective power among workers. But unions are in a beleaguered state. Due to legal and political changes over the past 40 years, only about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm\">one in 10 American workers</url> belongs to a union. A 2018       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/585/16-1466/\">Supreme Court</url> decision threatens the viability of public-sector unions, the one segment of organized labor that has bucked the downward trend. All of this has left the American labor movement in a weak position to counter the stagnation of wages or confront the rise of the app-emboldened gig economy.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/all-food-will-be-delivered/595222/?utm_source=feed\">Derek Thompson: The booming, ethically dubious business of food delivery</url>]<br/>Nationally,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gallup.com/file/workplace/240878/Gig_Economy_Paper_2018.pdf\">more than a third of workers</url> have part- or full-time arrangements in the gig economy. Indeed, an entire gig economy is built on denying drivers and food deliverers the benefits and protections that would come with treating them as employees. If ride-sharing drivers, home contractors, and freelance editors could band together-if not in a union, then as employees of a co-op or as a coalition of businesses-they could negotiate better terms. Yet when the city of Seattle tried to facilitate collective bargaining for Uber drivers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, with an assist from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/11/ftc-files-amicus-brief-appeals-court-case-involving-hire-drivers\">the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission</url>, sued the city using the Sherman Antitrust Act and compelled it to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/2019/06/chamber-of-commerce-v-city-of-seattle/\">back down</url>. This was not an aberrant misuse of antitrust; it was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/competition-matters/2015/01/unflattering-resemblance\">official policy</url>. The Federal Trade Commission has repeatedly targeted the collective action of professionals and small firms and sued, among other collectives, associations of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/131-0118/music-teachers-national-association-inc-matter\">music</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/131-0127/national-association-teachers-singing-inc-matter\">teachers</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/03/american-guild-organists-agrees-eliminate-rules-restrict\">organists</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/0310155/lewis-robert-james-sowder-gerald-wear-joel-r-yoseph\">public</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/493/411/\">defenders</url>.<br/>Where independent producers are allowed to collaborate, they gain leverage. Rural organizations like the Farmers' Alliance and the Grange formed producers' cooperatives that enjoyed significant bargaining power in their dealings with railroads and agricultural middlemen. These efforts formed the basis for later co-op brands like Cabot Creamery and Land O'Lakes, as well as for the New Deal-era electric cooperatives that still bring electricity to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.electric.coop/electric-cooperative-fact-sheet/\">42 million Americans</url>.<br/>Collective power is even more relevant in the internet age. For some time, courts and public-policy makers have been wrestling with whether ride-hailing drivers, whom Uber and Lyft treat as independent contractors, should be reclassified as employees and gain the rights that come with that status. A California Supreme Court ruling has nudged the state's legislature in that direction. Yet converting drivers into Uber employees isn't the only option. An intriguing       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cooperativeplatform.org/\">new bill</url> proposed by the SEIU-affiliated United Healthcare Workers West puts forth another possible arrangement-establishing a new category of cooperative, worker-owned companies that would supply labor to gig-economy platforms. Drivers and other gig-economy workers would be employees of these cooperatives, which would negotiate with Uber, Lyft, and other platforms to set contract terms, such as wages and working conditions. (This approach may be aided by the fact that federal law       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/445/97/\">allows</url> state legislators to protect co-ops from antitrust enforcement, as long as legislatures authorize and supervise their activities.)<br/>Another kind of collective power could transform the governance of the Amazon Marketplace in which      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://prospect.org/article/biggest-abuser-forced-arbitration-amazon\">2.5 million third-party sellers participate</url>. While the Marketplace offers new opportunities for small sellers around the world, it also leaves them subject to Amazon's whims. Sellers of most products       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200336920\">pay Amazon 15 percent</url> of every sale and can be removed from the platform, or banished to the bottom of search results, for any reason at all. They are at the mercy of rules set by Amazon and, in the event of a legal dispute, forced into       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://prospect.org/article/biggest-abuser-forced-arbitration-amazon\">individual arbitration</url>.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/why-silicon-valley-loved-uber-more-everyone-else/590203/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Why Silicon Valley loved Uber more than everyone else</url>]<br/>Even while sellers are at the mercy of Amazon, they often resort to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement\">unfair and unethical practices</url> against one another as a means of obtaining a competitive advantage, however fleeting. These tactics include submitting fake reviews of rivals' products and making specious trademark-infringement allegations. Although Amazon does punish the worst of these tactics, it benefits immensely from pitting independent sellers against one another.<br/>Organized sellers could build their own cooperative online commerce platform-or at least wield real power against Amazon. An association of sellers could negotiate a lower cut for Amazon, and members could keep 90 or 95 percent of their sales revenue, instead of the typical 85 percent. They could also establish dispute-resolution processes with more transparent rules. Much like what labor unions do with employers, collective power among sellers would transfer some power from Amazon's executives and shareholders to the people whose daily exertions actually make the platform work.<br/>New forms of collective power will require, among other legal reforms, significant legislative revision of the antitrust laws. To protect beneficial cooperation,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3279629\">as we have explained in detail</url> elsewhere, Congress has a template on which to build. The 1922 Capper-Volstead Act grants farmers and other agricultural producers the right to engage in collective action free from antitrust interference. They can cooperate in selling and processing their crops, milk, and other output and marketing the resulting products. While protected from the antitrust prohibition on collusion, farmer cooperation is still subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Congress should generalize the Capper-Volstead Act and extend its protection to all powerless actors in the economy-workers, professionals, consumers, and small firms. To prevent abuse of the cooperative form, Congress should also ensure this new protection is restricted to bona fide small players.<br/>While restructuring large corporations and establishing rules of fair market conduct are crucial, these aren't the only ways to protect the powerless in today's version of the Gilded Age economy. Cooperation among small actors can remedy the yawning imbalance of power between corporate giants and everyone else.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-fightingmonopolywillrequirecollectivepower595729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT1-5C21-DYY9-J4V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1548\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

On Monday, the US Congress's judiciary committee announced a \"top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms\". Government agencies responsible for competition policy have been dividing up Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon for investigations too. Their conclusions will have worldwide ramifications for the regulation and viability of these business models.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such action has been slowly brewing. Despite scant evidence that consumers are harmed by these companies' activities - the key metric since the \"consumer welfare standard\" made competition policy technocratic - a congruence of pressures has led to a perfect storm engulfing the firms.</p><p>The rise of anti-capitalist feelings on the US Left, married to the belief tech companies' permissiveness helped Donald Trump win the presidency, means there's little love lost from key Democrats. On the Right, these firms are seen as being staffed by liberals who detest conservatism and/or the president. The companies therefore find few defenders on Capitol Hill or cable news networks. They are in the crosshairs of a culture war.</p><p>Alongside these political pressures come economists and lawyers claiming the whole antitrust approach needs rethinking. A revived \"big is bad\" intellectual movement argues the \"consumer welfare standard\" provides too narrow a view on companies' competitive impacts. Many people want a more comprehensive, yet arbitrary, approach that considers the effects of companies' business on inequality, wages, downstream suppliers and the concentration of political power.</p><p>To top this off, many adherents of the consumer welfare standard have themselves become convinced tech companies are just different. Network effects (where the value of a product rises with user numbers), economies of scale, access to vast data, the bundling of products and the operation of huge online marketplaces are features of these firms' markets. Even if there's no consumer harm today, some claim these phenomena create barriers to entry that will entrench the tech giants as harmful monopolies in future. Competition policy, it is said, must therefore be forward-looking and see off these harms.</p><p>Alone, none of these arguments are novel. Together, they threaten a counter-revolution in how competition policy is delivered.</p><p>Anti-big populism used to be a strong force in US competition policy. The first successful chain grocery store - A&amp;P - was harried through the courts in the Forties after rapid growth delivered cheap food for consumers. The company was accused of predatory price cutting, harming small local retailers, undermining wholesalers through its huge buying power, and using its marketplaces to sell its own goods preferentially against competitors. Readers might note the parallels to concerns about Amazon today. Yet predictions of A&amp;P's sustained monopoly power did not stand the test of time, following the rise of big-box supermarkets.</p><p>In fact, the fatalism we see about tech companies is incredibly presentbiased. Large businesses have been predicted to monopolise sectors owing to these same economic phenomena before, only to be cannibalised by new products or ways of doing business.</p><p>The \"network effects\" said to protect Facebook or Google from competition were, at different times, thought to be creating monopolies out of MySpace, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and AOL's Instant Messenger.</p><p>As late as 2006, experts claimed that web managers optimising their sites for Internet Explorer due to its wide usage created a feedback loop that would be an insurmountable barrier to competitors. In the case of AOL's Instant Messenger, 40 businesses even wrote to the US Federal Communications Commission asking for AOL's network to be opened to other firms' services. Since then, MySpace has been eaten alive by Facebook, Internet Explorer by Google Chrome, and instant messaging is now available on scores of new apps and services.</p><p>History, in other words, is replete with examples of dominant firms falling by the wayside despite having the exact same economic advantages that worry us today. Experts wail about Apple's app store, for example. They say the firm is anticompetitive because it makes the store the exclusive download mechanism for apps on the iPhone, supposedly giving itself monopoly power to extort app producers. Leaving aside that developing the app store (as with Amazon's marketplace) has boosted competition across scores of markets, similar arguments were made about Apple's iPods only playing songs formatted from its iTunes store.</p><p>Then came the rise of music subscription services, such as Spotify and Pandora, as well as the smartphone. Technology and changing consumer tastes ultimately forced an unbundling of music purchase and listening devices.</p><p>This kind of competitive pressure is difficult to forecast. But it's real.</p><p>Kodak, long dominant in the film and photography market, missed the boat on digital cameras, before that sector was again disrupted by smartphones and the internet. In 2007, Forbes magazine claimed economies of scale for Nokia made life near-impossible for its rivals, by generating \"more money to invest in research and development\". Nokia's technological superiority was said to mean \"no mobile company will ever know more about how people use phones\". The first iPhone launched that year.</p><p>As these investigations get under way, be extraordinarily wary about claims that \"this time is different\" and necessitates a new antitrust approach. This politically convenient talking point will come from both wellmeaning economic sources and vested interests, and the sheer size of these firms will mean it is taken seriously.</p><p>Yet history shows investigations can be hijacked to consumers' detriment. Though these firms may well engage in some anticompetitive actions, none of the economic features that can \"tip\" markets to one-firm dominance for a time have created permanent monopolies before. Overhauling policy on the speculative threat of \"future harms\" is a fool's errand.</p><p>Ryan Bourne holds the R Evan Scharf chair for the public understanding of economics at the Cato Institute</p><p>'History is replete with examples of firms falling back despite having the same economic advantages that worry us today'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Companies such as Facebook, run by Mark Zuckerberg, have few defenders on Capital Hill or in US cable news networksCHIP SOMODEVILLA / GETTY IMAGES</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-149941358</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8W-YYH1-JCBW-N1WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 7, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This declaration came in the wake of Uber being dragged to the CCMA several months ago by seven driver-partners who alleged that they were unfairly deactivated by the service.</p><p>The ride-hailing service has long maintained that it is simply a virtual marketplace that connects drivers and passengers and not an employer - citing the fact that Uber doesn't own cars or have drivers on their payroll.</p><p>Since CCMA commissioner Winnie Everett ruled in this matter, Uber South Africa has been at pains to \"clarify\" that the determination only applies to the seven individual drivers who acted against them, and not to all of the 2500 odd driver-partners they currently \"contract\" across the country.</p><p>No win yet</p><p>Uber South Africa has since approached the nation's Labour Court to have the CCMA's ruling set aside. In a statement, Uber assured the public that this legal matter was a long way away from being resolved and that neither side - presumably Uber on one and the seven feuding drivers on the other - is in any position to call a win just yet.</p><p>As far as I'm concerned, Uber's position is problematic, because it betrays the company's preoccupation with achieving complete and utter domination - not just in South Africa, but around the world.</p><p>Call me an idealist, but surely the new sharing economy trend that Uber is surfing shouldn't be about big tech players winning at everyone else's expense. We should all be on the same side - backing inclusive progress.</p><p>Disclaimer: I am a frequent user of Uber's services, and if there's anyone hoping that the company gets its cultural issues sorted out so that it can focus on winning over all, or at least most, of the stakeholders currently aggrieved by them, it's me.</p><p>Similarly, I'm rooting for society at large to commit to finding ways to harness the on-demand marketplace trend to produce a win-win situation for everybody. Certainly, as the poster child for the new sharing economy, Uber should be leading the way in helping the world establish how that can happen.</p><p>The problem is, up until he recently stepped down as the company's chief executive, <person><nameText>Travis Kalanick's </nameText></person>less-than-elegant approach to pursuing success at Uber was to stomp into as many markets all over the world, intent on disruption and dominance by any means necessary. That's created a troublesome scenario in which Uber's sustained growth and push towards profitability seems to have to happen at the expense of anyone, and indeed, anything that stands in the tech giant's way.</p><p>Musa Kalenga is a Zambian digital marketing maven based in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p><p>He was formerly a client partner at Facebook Africa and is currently the chief executive of a new adtech venture he co-founded called Microtising.</p><p>As a frequent co-host on the African Tech Round-up podcast, Kalenga has often expressed his discontentment with Uber's problematic cultural issues and highlighted how Kalanick's noxious leadership style has negatively impacted the company's prospects on the continent.</p><p>'Fundamental illegality'</p><p>In a recent episode of the programme, Kalenga cited a Harvard Business Review article by Benjamin Edelman entitled Uber Can't Be Fixed - It's Time for Regulators to Shut It Down. In the piece, Edelman - who strikes me as a zealous Marxist - makes a case for what he calls Uber's \"fundamental illegality\".</p><p>Now, while neither Kalenga and I subscribe to the extreme view that Uber should be shuttered, one can't ignore how in many respects, the company's success has been predicated on a willingness to blatantly flout regulations by launching first and asking questions later.</p><p>The inconvenient truth for Uber's detractors, however, is that their mission would be a non-issue if markets hadn't so enthusiastically bought into the company's fairly attractive value proposition.</p><p>While I, along with millions of others around the world, have come to appreciate the convenience that Uber has brought into our lives, I'm not blind to their shortcomings as an organisation.</p><p>It would seem that on one end of the spectrum lies Uber and its unhealthy obsession with achieving ubiquity and profitability. At the other end, stand anti-Uber activists who feel that on-demand platform poster children like Uber and Airbnb not only normalise a culture of dubious commercial ingenuity - read illegality - but also upend livelihoods with little or no thought to how their innovations might negatively impact society.</p><p>Then, somewhere in the middle of that continuum we find Uber driver-partners, who, while content to make a decent living using the firm's platform, are justifiably dissatisfied with the company's tendency to keep them at arms length whenever it suits them - not least when they have sought relief from violent members of the traditional metered taxi community.</p><p>I'm in no position to question the motives of the seven drivers who hauled Uber to the CCMA for reparations, but I'm struck by the irony of how their choice to pursue their own welfare (they might well argue that they are acting for the greater good of their community) by mounting a legal attack on the ride-sharing platform, might negatively compromise their future prospects to earn a living driving for Uber or indeed any other ride-hailing platform.</p><p>Because if the Labour Court holds up the CCMA's decision and Uber is forced to assume the burden of being an employer and a public transport service provider in terms of South African law, that will likely irreparably impact the sustainability of their business model.</p><p>That could then pave the way for Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi to follow through on threats to force Uber drivers to apply for public transport licences, and that would result in Uber drivers being required to operate in pre-allocated geographic zones.</p><p>My frustration is that the folks at Uber are clearly in it for themselves, as are the company's driver-partners - seven of whom are no doubt in full self-preservation mode at the moment.</p><p>As for the traditional taxi industry? Well, the streets can testify to how they've been letting sjamboks and fire lighting ceremonies reinforce their self-interest. Sadly, it appears that none of the aforementioned parties are committed to backing an inclusive agenda that puts society's best interests first.</p><p>Andile Masuku is a broadcaster and entrepreneur based in Johannesburg.
