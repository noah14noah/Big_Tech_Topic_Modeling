The hearing followed a discussion at CES about whether the government should break up dominant platforms (see 2001100007). The hearing was streamed from the University of Colorado Law School.</p><p>\"Companies across the online ecosystem, both large and small, have found themselves dependent on the arbitrary whim of these platform giants, one algorithm tweak away from ruin,\" said Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I. \"It has become clear that these firms have tremendous power as gatekeepers to shape and control commerce online.\"</p><p>\"We have seen the largest platforms continue to expand and increase their market power,\" raising concerns \"about how that power is being used,\" said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.Congress shouldn't forget benefits innovation has brought for consumers and that big isn't always bad, he said. \"Any legislative proposals ... should be consistent with maintaining a free and competitive marketplace. Proposals to create broad new regulatory regimes must be viewed with caution. ... Burdensome regulations often miss the mark.\"</p><p>\"The market conditions that allowed us to innovate and thrive over the past two decades are being endangered by the rise of a small group of dominant companies with unprecedented power,\" said Patrick Spence, CEO of smart speaker company Sonos. \"We believe that this committee needs to act urgently to rein in the power of these dominant companies.\" The company is suing Google (see 2001070041).</p><p>Big players so dominate the market, \"they have become essential business partners for every company,\" Spence said. Getting access to their platforms is becoming \"more and more of a take it or leave it proposition.\" The companies have even asked Sonos to suppress its inventions, he said. \"The most recent example of this is Google's refusal to allow us to use multiple voice assistants on our products simultaneously,\" he said: \"We need to rethink existing laws and policies.\"</p><p>PopSockets had enormous success initially when it sold on Amazon, said David Barnett, CEO of the company, which makes removable grips for smartphones. Then, counterfeits became an issue and \"we discovered that Amazon itself had sourced counterfeit product and was selling it alongside our own products,\" he said. \"At one point, we were recording a thousand listings a day of fakes.\"</p><p>Amazon bullied PopSockets, Barnett said. Amazon sets the price and \"they come back to us and demand funding for their lost margin when they lower their price.\" Barnett said at that point, the \"bullying begins.\" PopSockets decided to end the relationship. Amazon's response \"was, 'No, you're not leaving the relationship,'\" he said: \"I found that unbelievable ... after we told them that bullying was the main reason we were leaving.\" The company left anyway and Amazon removed listings of its PopSockets' resellers, he said. Other companies continue to do business with Amazon, he said: \"It's because of the power asymmetry that companies tolerate this, they have to tolerate it.\"</p><p>\"PopSockets has been a valued retail vendor at Amazon and also supplies its products directly to other major retailers,\" an Amazon spokesperson emailed. Like any brand, the company is \"free to choose which retailers it supplies and chose to stop selling directly through Amazon. Even so, we've continued to work with PopSockets to address our shared concerns about counterfeit, and continue to have a relationship with PopSockets through Merch by Amazon, which enables other sellers to create customized PopSockets for sale.\"</p><p>David Hansson, chief technology officer of software company Basecamp, said that when company launched in 2004, the internet offered a largely free and open market. That's \"no longer true,\" he said: \"The internet has been colonized by a handful of big tech companies that wield their monopoly power without restraint. This power allows them to bully, extort, or, should they please, even destroy our business.\" Big platforms control whether \"customers are able to find us online\" and \"can access our software using their mobile devices,\" Hansson said. \"The promise that the internet was going to cut out the middleman has been broken.\"</p><p>Google has an almost complete monopoly over internet searches, Hansson said. \"Their multibillion dollar bribes to browser makers like Apple ensure no fair competition will ever have a chance to emerge.\" With its app store, Apple owns \"one of the only two mobile application stores that matter\" and the other belongs to Google, he said: This \"cozy duopoly\" means Apple can charge \"exorbitantly high\" 30 percent fees for processing payments. \"Help us, Congress, you are our only hope,\" Hansson said.</p><p>\"We created the App Store with two goals in mind: that it be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers,\" an Apple spokesperson emailed. \"We continually work with developers and take their feedback on how to help protect user privacy while also providing the tools developers need to make the best app experiences.\" Google didn't comment.</p><p>Cicilline has heard too many \"horror\" stories from small companies that an abrupt change from one of the platforms has destroyed their business. \"It is apparent that the dominant platforms are increasingly using their gatekeeper power in abusive and coercive ways,\" he said: \"Because these platforms function as bottlenecks for online commerce, they are able to set the terms and conditions of competition, giving them immense power to pick winners and losers in the online economy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y24-DND1-JC8G-80KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The lawmakers are seeking a detailed and broad range of documents related to the companies' sprawling operations, including top executives' internal communications. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move comes as scrutiny of the companies deepens and widens across the federal government and U.S. states and abroad. </p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting competition investigations of the companies, and state attorneys general from both major political parties have opened antitrust investigations of Google and Facebook. </p><p>\"We have to act if we see that they're breaking the law,\" Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said Friday. Chopra, a Democrat, wouldn't confirm  names of companies that could be under investigation, but he said the agency is consulting  with the Justice Department and the state attorneys general as their work proceeds. </p><p>Also Friday, the European Union's powerful competition chief indicated that she's looking at expanding regulations on personal data, dropping an initial hint about how she plans to use new powers against tech companies. Margrethe Vestager said that while Europeans have control over their own data through the EU's world-leading data privacy rules, they don't address problems stemming from the way companies use other people's data \"to draw conclusions about me or to undermine democracy.\" </p><p>The House lawmakers set an Oct. 14 deadline for the companies to provide the documents. </p><p>Spokesmen for Facebook, Apple and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. Google referred to a recent blog post by its senior vice president for global affairs, Kent Walker, in which he said the company is anticipating additional questions from investigations and that \"We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\" </p><p>The companies have said they'll cooperate  with the congressional investigation. </p><p>Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the documents will help the committee understand \"whether they are using their market power in ways that have harmed consumers and competition and how Congress should respond.\" </p><p>The letters went to the  companies' CEOs: Larry Page of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook; Jeff Bezos of Amazon; and Tim Cook of Apple. They were signed by Nadler; Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the Judiciary Committee's senior Republican; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who heads the antitrust subcommittee leading the investigation; and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the subcommittee's senior Republican. </p><p>Cicilline has said Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed the companies to regulate themselves, enabling them to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship. He has suggested legislative changes may be needed, though he has called breaking up the companies a last resort. </p><p>At a hearing of the antitrust panel in July, executives of the  companies pushed back against lawmakers' accusations that they operate as monopolies, laying out ways in which they say they compete fairly against rivals in the marketplace. </p><p>Saying he was dissatisfied with the answers of the executives, Cicilline called the testimony \"evasive.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPRESS-VA0102282068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPRESS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X23-19B1-JBM5-R1CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173096</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Press, Inc.

The lawmakers are seeking a detailed and broad range of documents related to the companies' sprawling operations, including top executives' internal communications. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move comes as scrutiny of the companies deepens and widens across the federal government and U.S. states and abroad. </p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting competition investigations of the companies, and state attorneys general from both major political parties have opened antitrust investigations of Google and Facebook. </p><p>\"We have to act if we see that they're breaking the law,\" Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said Friday. Chopra, a Democrat, wouldn't confirm  names of companies that could be under investigation, but he said the agency is consulting  with the Justice Department and the state attorneys general as their work proceeds. </p><p>Also Friday, the European Union's powerful competition chief indicated that she's looking at expanding regulations on personal data, dropping an initial hint about how she plans to use new powers against tech companies. Margrethe Vestager said that while Europeans have control over their own data through the EU's world-leading data privacy rules, they don't address  problems stemming from the way companies use other people's data \"to draw conclusions about me or to undermine democracy.\" The House lawmakers set an Oct. 14 deadline for the companies to provide the documents. </p><p>Spokesmen for Facebook, Apple and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. Google referred to a recent blog post by its senior vice president for global affairs, Kent Walker, in which he said the company is anticipating additional questions from investigations and that \"We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\" </p><p>The companies have said they'll cooperate  with the congressional investigation. </p><p>Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the documents will help the committee understand \"whether they are using their market power in ways that have harmed consumers and competition and how Congress should respond.\" </p><p>The letters went to the  companies' CEOs: Larry Page of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook; Jeff Bezos of Amazon; and Tim Cook of Apple. They were signed by Nadler; Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the Judiciary Committee's senior Republican; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who heads the antitrust subcommittee leading the investigation; and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the subcommittee's senior Republican. </p><p>Cicilline has said Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed the companies to regulate themselves, enabling them to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship. He has suggested legislative changes may be needed, though he has called breaking up the companies a last resort. </p><p>At a hearing of the antitrust panel in July, executives of the  companies pushed back against lawmakers' accusations that they operate as monopolies, laying out ways in which they say they compete fairly against rivals in the marketplace. </p><p>Saying he was dissatisfied with the answers of the executives, Cicilline called the testimony \"evasive.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNSEN-FL0102281579</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNSEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X22-6F31-DY37-F1K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144570</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sentinel Communications Co.

Scott Applewhite/AP</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - Lawmakers investigating the market dominance of Big Tech on Friday asked Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple for a broad range of documents, marking a step forward in Congress' bipartisan probe of the companies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Letters went out to the four companies from the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee and its subcommittee on antitrust, which has been conducting a sweeping antitrust investigation of the companies and their impact on competition and consumers. The lawmakers are seeking a detailed and broad range of documents related to the companies' sprawling operations, including top executives' internal communications. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move comes as scrutiny of the companies deepens and widens across the federal government and U.S. states and abroad. </p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting competition investigations of the companies, and state attorneys general from both major political parties have opened antitrust investigations of Google and Facebook. </p><p>\"We have to act if we see that they're breaking the law,\" Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said Friday. Chopra, a Democrat, wouldn't confirm  names of companies that could be under investigation, but he said the agency is consulting  with the Justice Department and the state attorneys general as their work proceeds. </p><p>Also Friday, the European Union's powerful competition chief indicated that she's looking at expanding regulations on personal data, dropping an initial hint about how she plans to use new powers against tech companies. Margrethe Vestager said that while Europeans have control over their own data through the EU's world-leading data privacy rules, they don't address problems stemming from the way companies use other people's data \"to draw conclusions about me or to undermine democracy.\" </p><p>The House lawmakers set an Oct. 14 deadline for the companies to provide the documents. </p><p>Spokesmen for Facebook, Apple and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. Google referred to a recent blog post by its senior vice president for global affairs, Kent Walker, in which he said the company is anticipating additional questions from investigations and that \"We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\" </p><p>The companies have said they'll cooperate  with the congressional investigation. </p><p>Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the documents will help the committee understand \"whether they are using their market power in ways that have harmed consumers and competition and how Congress should respond.\" </p><p>The letters went to the  companies' CEOs: Larry Page of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook; Jeff Bezos of Amazon; and Tim Cook of Apple. They were signed by Nadler; Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the Judiciary Committee's senior Republican; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who heads the antitrust subcommittee leading the investigation; and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the subcommittee's senior Republican. </p><p>Cicilline has said Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed the companies to regulate themselves, enabling them to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship. He has suggested legislative changes may be needed, though he has called breaking up the companies a last resort. </p><p>At a hearing of the antitrust panel in July, executives of the  companies pushed back against lawmakers' accusations that they operate as monopolies, laying out ways in which they say they compete fairly against rivals in the marketplace. </p><p>Saying he was dissatisfied with the answers of the executives, Cicilline called the testimony \"evasive.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ORSENT-OS0102281999</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ORSENT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X22-6F31-DY37-F21Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sentinel Communications Co.

The lawmakers are seeking a detailed and broad range of documents related to the companies' sprawling operations, including top executives' internal communications. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move comes as scrutiny of the companies deepens and widens across the federal government and U.S. states and abroad. </p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting competition investigations of the companies, and state attorneys general from both major political parties have opened antitrust investigations of Google and Facebook. </p><p>\"We have to act if we see that they're breaking the law,\" Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said Friday. Chopra, a Democrat, wouldn't confirm  names of companies that could be under investigation, but he said the agency is consulting  with the Justice Department and the state attorneys general as their work proceeds. </p><p>Also Friday, the European Union's powerful competition chief indicated that she's looking at expanding regulations on personal data, dropping an initial hint about how she plans to use new powers against tech companies. Margrethe Vestager said that while Europeans have control over their own data through the EU's world-leading data privacy rules, they don't address problems stemming from the way companies use other people's data \"to draw conclusions about me or to undermine democracy.\" </p><p>The House lawmakers set an Oct. 14 deadline for the companies to provide the documents. </p><p>Spokesmen for Facebook, Apple and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. Google referred to a recent blog post by its senior vice president for global affairs, Kent Walker, in which he said the company is anticipating additional questions from investigations and that \"We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\" </p><p>The companies have said they'll cooperate  with the congressional investigation. </p><p>Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the documents will help the committee understand \"whether they are using their market power in ways that have harmed consumers and competition and how Congress should respond.\" </p><p>The letters went to the  companies' CEOs: Larry Page of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook; Jeff Bezos of Amazon; and Tim Cook of Apple. They were signed by Nadler; Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the Judiciary Committee's senior Republican; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who heads the antitrust subcommittee leading the investigation; and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the subcommittee's senior Republican. </p><p>Cicilline has said Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed the companies to regulate themselves, enabling them to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship. He has suggested legislative changes may be needed, though he has called breaking up the companies a last resort. </p><p>At a hearing of the antitrust panel in July, executives of the  companies pushed back against lawmakers' accusations that they operate as monopolies, laying out ways in which they say they compete fairly against rivals in the marketplace. </p><p>Saying he was dissatisfied with the answers of the executives, Cicilline called the testimony \"evasive.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPRESS-VA0102282059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPRESS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X23-19B1-JBM5-R1CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173096</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Press, Inc.

The lawmakers are seeking a detailed and broad range of documents related to the companies' sprawling operations, including top executives' internal communications. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move comes as scrutiny of the companies deepens and widens across the federal government and U.S. states and abroad. </p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting competition investigations of the companies, and state attorneys general from both major political parties have opened antitrust investigations of Google and Facebook. </p><p>\"We have to act if we see that they're breaking the law,\" Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said Friday. Chopra, a Democrat, wouldn't confirm  names of companies that could be under investigation, but he said the agency is consulting  with the Justice Department and the state attorneys general as their work proceeds. </p><p>Also Friday, the European Union's powerful competition chief indicated that she's looking at expanding regulations on personal data, dropping an initial hint about how she plans to use new powers against tech companies. Margrethe Vestager said that while Europeans have control over their own data through the EU's world-leading data privacy rules, they don't address  problems stemming from the way companies use other people's data \"to draw conclusions about me or to undermine democracy.\" The House lawmakers set an Oct. 14 deadline for the companies to provide the documents. </p><p>Spokesmen for Facebook, Apple and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. Google referred to a recent blog post by its senior vice president for global affairs, Kent Walker, in which he said the company is anticipating additional questions from investigations and that \"We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\" </p><p>The companies have said they'll cooperate  with the congressional investigation. </p><p>Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the documents will help the committee understand \"whether they are using their market power in ways that have harmed consumers and competition and how Congress should respond.\" </p><p>The letters went to the  companies' CEOs: Larry Page of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook; Jeff Bezos of Amazon; and Tim Cook of Apple. They were signed by Nadler; Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the Judiciary Committee's senior Republican; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who heads the antitrust subcommittee leading the investigation; and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the subcommittee's senior Republican. </p><p>Cicilline has said Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed the companies to regulate themselves, enabling them to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship. He has suggested legislative changes may be needed, though he has called breaking up the companies a last resort. </p><p>At a hearing of the antitrust panel in July, executives of the  companies pushed back against lawmakers' accusations that they operate as monopolies, laying out ways in which they say they compete fairly against rivals in the marketplace. </p><p>Saying he was dissatisfied with the answers of the executives, Cicilline called the testimony \"evasive.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNSEN-FL0102281570</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNSEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X22-6F31-DY37-F1K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144570</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sentinel Communications Co.

The lawmakers are seeking a detailed and broad range of documents related to the companies' sprawling operations, including top executives' internal communications. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move comes as scrutiny of the companies deepens and widens across the federal government and U.S. states and abroad. </p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting competition investigations of the companies, and state attorneys general from both major political parties have opened antitrust investigations of Google and Facebook. </p><p>\"We have to act if we see that they're breaking the law,\" Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said Friday. Chopra, a Democrat, wouldn't confirm  names of companies that could be under investigation, but he said the agency is consulting  with the Justice Department and the state attorneys general as their work proceeds. </p><p>Also Friday, the European Union's powerful competition chief indicated that she's looking at expanding regulations on personal data, dropping an initial hint about how she plans to use new powers against tech companies. Margrethe Vestager said that while Europeans have control over their own data through the EU's world-leading data privacy rules, they don't address problems stemming from the way companies use other people's data \"to draw conclusions about me or to undermine democracy.\" </p><p>The House lawmakers set an Oct. 14 deadline for the companies to provide the documents. </p><p>Spokesmen for Facebook, Apple and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. Google referred to a recent blog post by its senior vice president for global affairs, Kent Walker, in which he said the company is anticipating additional questions from investigations and that \"We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\" </p><p>The companies have said they'll cooperate  with the congressional investigation. </p><p>Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the documents will help the committee understand \"whether they are using their market power in ways that have harmed consumers and competition and how Congress should respond.\" </p><p>The letters went to the  companies' CEOs: Larry Page of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook; Jeff Bezos of Amazon; and Tim Cook of Apple. They were signed by Nadler; Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the Judiciary Committee's senior Republican; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who heads the antitrust subcommittee leading the investigation; and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the subcommittee's senior Republican. </p><p>Cicilline has said Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed the companies to regulate themselves, enabling them to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship. He has suggested legislative changes may be needed, though he has called breaking up the companies a last resort. </p><p>At a hearing of the antitrust panel in July, executives of the  companies pushed back against lawmakers' accusations that they operate as monopolies, laying out ways in which they say they compete fairly against rivals in the marketplace. </p><p>Saying he was dissatisfied with the answers of the executives, Cicilline called the testimony \"evasive.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HTCOUN-HC0102286437</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HTCOUR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X22-6F31-DY37-F1R0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Hartford Courant Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hartford Courant</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 14, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Tech companies that argued against the bill said that the current law has encouraged free speech online and helped the internet thrive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But sex trafficking victims and law enforcement officials say the existing law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has been too loosely applied by sites like Backpage.com, a site known for prostitution and sex trafficking. Some large online companies, including Facebook, eventually backed off from their opposition to the bill after its scope was narrowed.</p><p>\u201cCongress never intended for the internet to be a haven for criminal activity,\u201d said Representative Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican who introduced the bill, known as the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. \u201cThis is not a slippery slope. It is a narrow amendment to stop crimes by businesses online that they weren\u2019t able to commit offline.\u201d</p><p>A similar bill in the Senate was expected to pass soon.</p><p>The new legislation would not affect most internet companies. A victim would need to prove a site had knowingly facilitated sex trafficking to successfully sue the company. But not all online companies could hide behind the Section 230 shield.</p><p>The bill\u2019s passage in the House signaled an important turning point for an industry that has largely operated free of regulations. Pressure has been mounting for social media companies and other internet giants to be better stewards of their powerful platforms.</p><p>Facebook, in particular, has come under pressure over the spread of misinformation and the exertion of foreign interference during the 2016 presidential election. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called for regulations, including disclosures on political advertising, but those efforts have been slow to gain wide support.</p><p>\u201cClearly the environment has changed a lot for big internet companies over the past year,\u201d said Paul Gallant, a tech and telecom industry analyst at Cowen &amp; Co. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t think there is a willingness for the government to pursue fundamental business model changes.\u201d</p><p>Facebook began to change its position on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/technology/sex-trafficking-bill.html\">the bill last fall</url>, before congressional hearings on sex-trafficking bills and an intelligence committee hearing on Russian influence on social networks.</p><p>\u201cWe all have a responsibility to do our part to fight this,\u201d Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote in a post on the site this week. \u201cWe at Facebook support efforts to pass amended legislation in the House that would allow responsible companies to continue fighting sex trafficking while giving victims the chance to seek justice against companies that knowingly facilitate such abhorrent acts.\u201d</p><p>Some large tech companies, including Oracle, IBM and HP, have supported the new legislative effort all along. But many start-ups, including those represented by Engine Advocacy, a trade group, remained opposed to the bills.</p><p>Engine Advocacy said part of the bill would hurt start-ups that lean heavily on user-generated content, and could lead Congress to take more actions to weaken the openness of the internet.</p><p>PHOTO: \u201cCongress never intended for the internet to be a haven for criminal activity,\u201d said Representative Ann Wagner of Missouri, who introduced the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act.

The Radical Dems have completed their effort to formalize their efforts to overthrow the president of the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The vote in the House, 232 to 196. All of the two of those Radical Dems today voted to approve the so-called rules by which they will carry on their proceedings against the president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After 37 days of secrecy and subversion the Radical Dems voted to now make their unprecedented secret assault against this president public. But not -- not before they hold more secret hearings over the next week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Republicans protested, but could do little more than vote no. And that closed 232 to 196 vote means the Radical Dems have a clear statement that impeachment should never have been attempted in the House.</p><p>Not a single Republican broke ranks. Every one of them voted against the bill. Two Democrats joined the Republicans in their opposition. And the party of hate has cheated and lied throughout in their efforts to subvert President Trump.</p><p>All the while, the president is doing what he has always done. He's working. He's pressing ahead with his agenda and perhaps even under his breath cussing Pelosi, Schiff and the rest. Let's go to Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Trump dismissed today's vote on the resolution as more posturing by Democrats, ripping them in a radio appearance with the U.K.'s Nigel Farage.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The Democrats are desperate. They are desperate. They have nothing. And it's the only way they're going to try and win the election this way because they can't win it the fair way.</p><p>ROBERTS: While the White House had said it would not cooperate with the inquiry until House Speaker Pelosi held a vote in the full House cooperation apparently is still not forthcoming. White House official saying, the resolution does not ensure due process for the president.</p><p>STEPHANIE GRISHAM, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We don't know the rules yet for the White House. Are we going to get to even be involved? I don't think so.</p><p>ROBERTS: Democrats insist the new guidelines do allow the president and his council to participate, but not until the third phase of the inquiry after it has been referred to the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>And even then the president's involvement is subject to the discretion of the chairman. This afternoon, President Trump summoned House GOP members to the White House to discuss next steps while communications staff briefed surrogates on what they call the impeachment sham.</p><p>The message from the White House. That it's President Trump who was working on behalf of the country, not Democrats. A new Associated Press poll tonight finds that the president's support among Republicans is holding steady.</p><p>Eighty-five percent of Republicans approved of the president's handling of the job. Overall his job approval rating stands at 42 percent. Lou?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: John, thank you very much. John Roberts, from the White House. President Trump's strong approval ratings among the Republican Party show in today's vote with every present Republican member of congress voting against the Dems' sham, impeachment rules resolution.</p><p>Of the 232 Democrats who voted in favor of today's motion, 79 of them are from 21 states that President Trump won in 2016. Think about that. And on an average, President Trump won those states by a margin of almost 14 percent.</p><p>A notable yes vote today came from Congressman Alcee Hastings. Hastings himself was impeached by the senate for accepting bribes in exchange for lenient sentences during his time as a federal judge in Florida.</p><p>It was seemed today's Democratic Party however is short of the historical need to impeach President Trump. For historical context, the House voted 228-206 in favor of impeaching President Clinton for perjury, 221 to 212 for obstruction of justice in October 1998.</p><p>President Nixon's impeachment inquiry however was certainly bipartisan. Formally ratified in the House in February of '74 by a margin of 410 to four.</p><p>And in February, 18 to 68 the House voted 126 to 47 in favor of a resolution to impeach President Andrew Johnson. Only Nixon did not survive those votes.</p><p>While votes were taken today in Congress, the Dems' shadowy inquiry continued. National Security Council Official, Tim Morrison was on Capitol Hill, there he answered questions from lawmakers behind closed doors, of course.</p><p>But it appears he delivered a major blow against the left's narrative of improper behavior by President Trump during that July phone call with the leader of Ukraine. Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge with the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Lou, a top National Security Council official with first-hand knowledge of the phone call told investigators that he didn't think anything improper or illegal was discussed on the call and he thought the publicly released transcript was complete.</p><p>According to this prepared remarks obtained by Fox News, Tim Morrison said he had immediate concerns the transcript would leak. How it would play out in Washington's polarized environment and how a leak would affect bipartisan support for Ukraine as well as how it would affect the Ukrainian perception of the U.S.</p><p>In addition, he said quote, I want to be clear. I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed. Morrison told investigators he had no reason to believe the Ukrainians had knowledge the military aid was on hold until the end of August when the Politico story was published.</p><p>And he had no reason to believe the release of it might be conditioned on a public statement about re-opening an investigation into the Ukraine energy firm where Joe Biden's son sat on the board until weeks after the call.</p><p>Morrison's testimony about the call transcript as complete appears to undercut Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman who reportedly questioned whether it was tampered with.</p><p>A source close to the deposition today said, Morrison also warned about Vindman's judgment. And on at least one occasion he said, Vindman went outside the chain of command on Ukraine. Lou?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you very much. Catherine Herridge, reporting. Our first guest tonight was in today's closed door deposition of Tim Morrison.</p><p>And joining us now is Congressman Scott Perry. He's a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman, good to have you with us.</p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R-PA), HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: Great to be here with you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: To the degree that you can, give us your sense of Morrison's testimony and its potential damage or support of the president.</p><p>PERRY: Well, I would say this. First of all, the Democrats keep on saying, well you won't talk about, but you Republicans won't talk about the substance, you just want to talk about process.</p><p>We can talk about substance because it would be an ethics violation. But let me say this, today was a -- was a very positive day for Republicans, and Adam Schiff's Star Chamber.</p><p>The folks there had a very sour face. It's interesting, we finished up our deposition early today and I think that's an indicator of how fast they wanted to get that guy out of -- out of the room because he obliterated their narrative. And you will see it I think at some point, it's going to take a while, but you will see what he said at some point.</p><p>DOBBS: To the degree you can, give us some sense of this process --</p><p>PERRY: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: -- today, they formalized a process, but it certainly doesn't legitimize anything. And moving forward, what are we to expect? We've got a sense that there will be more secret hearings. When does a public process begin and will it ever be put forward without the approval of Adam Schiff.</p><p>PERRY: Well, first of all, as your White House reporter said, the president and more due process doesn't really happen until phase three until it gets to judiciary.</p><p>So, imagine playing a baseball game where the opponent gets three strikes but you only get two. And you know, you only get to -- you only get to hit with half a bat until the 9th inning. That's the process they just approved today.</p><p>So, while they are saying that you can call witnesses and you can have counsel president, that's the discretion of Chairman Schiff. And I would just remind everybody that while we've been in the SCIF (ph), when we have gone to questions regarding the intelligence community, he has said that is off limits.</p><p>Now, think about this, this is the chairman of the Intelligence Community we're in the Intelligence Community scif and he won't allow the minority have to ask questions about the intelligence community's involvement in the proceedings and these accusations.</p><p>That's what we're facing. So, it's going to be a continued situation where they are setting the table, a narrative that supports their objective, which is to defeat the president or impeach the president. It is not about fairness, it is not about justice. It's not about due process.</p><p>DOBBS: It is about wasting a lot of time and distracting from issues that this president must deal with. The House frankly, the Radical Dems have the luxury of not having to take care of any business other than to assault this president which they've done from the moment -- the moment he was elected in point of fact, not just simply inaugurated.</p><p>PERRY: Well, we've got -- we've got North Korea firing missiles. We could be passing the USMCA. We could be doing prescription drug reform. We could be doing infrastructure.</p><p>There are issues that the American people are very interested in. If Nancy -- if Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats want to spend their majority chasing this president around trying to do anything to impeach him, that's their business.</p><p>Unfortunately, the country gets dragged through with them. It is really unfortunate and irresponsible in my opinion.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah. I have to say, I didn't detect any sincerity at all. Perhaps, that was a mistake of my perception on the part of the speaker when she suggested that the Dems would be prayerful over this somber process. I did not see that somber attitude whatsoever.</p><p>PERRY: Well, Lou, if you were on the floor you would have heard them at the end of the vote, their members telling their other members not to cheer.</p><p>So, you need to be coached not to cheer because to them, this is what they've been seeking all along. And, of course, you don't see that if you're watching from home, but that's what we witnessed right there on the House floor. So sincerity I think is in question in this case.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman, thanks for being with us. We appreciate it.</p><p>PERRY: Thank you so much. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman Scott Perry. Up next, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reveals a new strategy on how the United States is dealing with China. We take that up with Dr. Michael Pillsbury. Also tonight, Secretary Pompeo holding forth on a number of foreign policy issues. We're coming right back. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Welcome back. Coming up on this broadcast, Congressman Mark Meadows joins us on the Radical Dems' efforts to formalize proceedings they can't legitimize against president. Also, where are we with the U.S.-China trade deal? Dr. Michael Pillsbury joins us tonight with that.</p><p>On Wall Street, stocks closing lower. The DOW Jones Industrials fell 140 points. The S&amp;P down, nine and the NASDAQ lost 12. Volume on the big board, moderate trading.</p><p>Crude oil closing flat over $4 a barrel. Gold gained three percent. Silver up six and a half percent. Gold and silver surging on investor anxiety about the trade deal between the United States and China.</p><p>Apple profits shrinking for a fourth consecutive quarter. The longest streak since 2016, profits fell three percent under $14 billion. Apple shares however, still trading two percent higher in after hours.</p><p>And the jobs report to be released tomorrow. Economists expecting about 75,000 jobs were added in October, down from 136,000 the previous month. The unemployment rate at three and a half percent, a 50-year low.</p><p>President Trump claims the Radical Dems are hurting the markets with their impeachment inquiry, so-called. Wall Street strategist say that isn't solved.</p><p>Now, I wonder who these strategists are. They are surely the same strategist who said tariffs would tariff our economy and these markets. These are strategists investors should in my judgment, probably not listen to.</p><p>President Trump today also sliming the fed after it cut interest rates for a third time this year, the president tweeted this, quote, people are very disappointed in Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The fed has called it wrong from the beginning, too fast, too slow. We are now by far the biggest and strongest country, but the fed puts us at a competitive advantage.</p><p>The president referring to the strength of the dollar and what that means to U.S. exports to the world. A reminder to listen to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Joining us tonight, Congressman Mark Meadows, member of the House Oversight Committee and member of the Freedom Caucus. Congressman, great to have you with us. And let's --</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Great to be back with you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: These secret Star Chamber proceedings that you are -- I guess the world is witnessing, since you can't exercise any full participation in them, give us your assessment of what happened today, the witness and your reaction to his testimony.</p><p>MEADOWS: Well, I think the Democrats called Mr. Morrison in to be one of their star witnesses believing that they would back up -- or be would back up their claim that the president used leverage with A, the Ukraine for something in return.</p><p>What we now know is not only was he not their star witness, but he turned out to be one of the best witnesses for the president and for the American people that we could have asked for.</p><p>I can tell you, early on, you know, a lot of my Democratic colleagues were just fidgeting in their seats. Their body language was one that showed disapproval of his testimony.</p><p>Because what he was doing was backing up the president of the United States. And you mentioned that we don't get to participate. It's interesting. We had a vote today on the House floor as you well know.</p><p>DOBBS: Right. Yeah.</p><p>MEADOWS: But I had to come out of an impeachment hearing in the basement, one that's been closed off to the cameras and to your viewers in order to vote for an impeachment vote.</p><p>You know, come on, the Democrats are craved to impeach this president and upset the votes and the will of the American people from November 2016.</p><p>DOBBS: It's stunning to watch this. And I -- and you to be there as it's unfolding against all reason. This vote and 196 Republicans standing fast and behind his president. That augurs poorly for these Radical Dems' and this specious effort to attack the president.</p><p>He calls it the greatest witch hunt ever. It is that, but he is -- by the way, he's gone through so many witch hunts. It's hard to pick the worst of the bunch.</p><p>MEADOWS: Well, here's the interesting thing is, we got some of the same players today that are working in this witch hunt that worked in the previous one.</p><p>You know, the rest -- the first one was the Russia hoax. Now, we have the Ukraine fairytale. And we've got the same players, its Adam Schiff and all of his group of individuals putting forth a narrative to spin it out to the American people, leak it out to the American people so that they believe something is happening behind closed doors that in fact, is not happening.</p><p>So, I'm here today to say let's put the deposition we just heard over the last seven hours behind closed doors. Let's put it out to the American people tonight.</p><p>If we do that, I can tell you, will have Democrats peeling off left and right. They will start to go the other way and they will say, you know what, it's time that we focus on 2020. Let them get their nominee. Let us go with President Donald J. Trump. I like our chances.</p><p>DOBBS: So do I. As a matter of fact, it is becoming I think increasingly clear that the Republicans are gaining rapidly an advantage over the Democratic Party in 2020. The president -- this party united behind him. I frankly -- I think the Democrats are in far more trouble than they can possibly imagine.</p><p>MEADOWS: Well they are. And you know why, Lou? Because this president has done what he campaigned on. I mean, that's why the Democrats are going crazy is because, this president campaigned on exactly what he's doing.</p><p>The economy is roaring, he's building the wall. He put the embassy in Jerusalem. He's making sure that regulations are cut. He's making sure that the hard-working American taxpayer actually get to keep more of their money. And he's done all of that. So it's promises kept. And I can tell you, that's driving the left crazy.</p><p>DOBBS: It is. And by the way, he also has unemployment down to a level not seen in a half century. Minorities in this country at record-low unemployment rates. And he didn't create a single new federal program.</p><p>He didn't require hundreds of billions of dollars to spread out across the country to get those jobs. These are driven jobs -- job creation driven by a pro business, a leader who actually believes in this free enterprise capitalist system of ours.</p><p>MEADOWS: Well, you're exactly right, Lou. He knows the American people are smart. And, you know, if you get out of the way and let them achieve the American dream, it's available for all of us. You've lived it, I lived it. We've been able to see so many other people lifted out of poverty.</p><p>But what happens is, it's not about another government program. It's about reducing government's role in our daily lives and allowing us to enjoy the prosperity of our hard work. And we need to put the value back in hard work and I believe this president is doing that.</p><p>DOBBS: Value and respect.</p><p>MEADOWS: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you very much congressman for all you're doing.</p><p>MEADOWS: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman Mark Meadows.</p><p>MEADOWS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next. Optimism from the White House at a trade deal with China will still be signed, but what progress has been made in those talks with China? We'll take that up with Dr. Michael Pillsbury. He joins me right after these messages. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: China's three state telecoms announcing that they've launched their 5G services as of today, ahead of the scheduled launch early next year.</p><p>China plans to install over 50,000 5G base stations across 50 Chinese cities by the end of this year. Currently, 10,000 5G stations are up and running in Beijing.</p><p>Telecom Huawei says it has already signed more than 60 commercial contracts to supply 5G networks around the world. The United States is lagging.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a passionate speech last night the Hudson Institute in New York. He slammed the communist Chinese regime amid ongoing trade talks between the United States and Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The communist government in China today is not the same as the people of China. They are reaching for and using methods that have created challenges for the United States and for the world.</p><p>And we collectively, all of us need to confront these challenges from the PRC head on. It's no longer realistic to ignore the fundamental differences between our two systems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And joining us tonight to take up that issue and many others, Dr. Michael Pillsbury. He's director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute.</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, HUDSON INSTITUTE CHINESE STRATEGY DIRECTOR: Hi.</p><p>DOBBS: Mike, good to have you here.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Thanks Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Listening to the secretary of state, he sound like a man who meant exactly what he's saying.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes, I think so. There's a lot of toughness in the speech. I particularly noticed his use of the phrase, the freedom-loving Chinese people.</p><p>He's going -- he's trying to create a wedge between the Chinese Communist Party leaders and the Chinese people. He had several references to loving Chinese-Americans inside our country as well.</p><p>It's already -- as I've said, the Chinese ambassador to Washington who has reacted very -- I would say viciously to this. And attacked what Secretary Pompeo was saying because according to Chinese Communist Party and the ambassador who's a member, all of China's success is due to the Communist Party.</p><p>So, how narrow Secretary Pompeo tried to draw a wedge between the Communist Party and the freedom-loving Chinese people. That was a quite effective comment he made.</p><p>DOBBS: Effective comment and obviously a designed and carefully considered comment. And without question, with the -- with the foreknowledge of what the reaction on the part of the Chinese would be.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: This is not looking good. The Chinese sending out signals for whoever's consumption that they are not pleased with the thought or comfortable with the thought that they would buy $40 to $50 billion of agricultural products.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: As they had earlier indicated they would. And this seems to be an impediment to phase one or perhaps to any deal at all. And it also seems to be again, the Chinese reneging on a deal that has not been put to paper yet.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes. The president had said quite clearly two weeks ago that he expected these purchases of agricultural products to begin immediately. Put it on all caps letter in his tweet.</p><p>What is happening I think Lou, if we look back over the last couple years, the Chinese have to -- have had to be dragged kicking and screaming into these talks, then they agree to 150 pages reneged on a lot of that.</p><p>Now, what both Steve Mnuchin and Peter Navarro have said, I believe it's correct. One of the seven chapters of the agreement has been more or less agreed to. That's what the president meant today when he said, 60 percent of the deal will be in this phase one. Then he wants to sign it within two weeks.</p><p>But the Chinese have continued to resist. They mobilize what Secretary Pompeo very, very frankly today, perhaps picking up from the theme of yours, Lou on the show. He used the terms, lobbyists for China, China lobbyists in Washington, D.C., and American business --</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah.</p><p>PILLSBURY: -- have made it very difficult for to us come to terms with the level of hostility from China toward our country.</p><p>DOBBS: And there's no reason for this administration, this president, his administration to rationalize it further. This is an inescapable confrontation on the part of the Chinese.</p><p>It is not an accident they are reneging in the last moments of the May withdrawal, from what is perceived to be an agreement. And this is not an accident.</p><p>It's -- and there has been no diminishment whatsoever of their cyber- attacks, of their intellectual property theft, of their trade theft and espionage against this country during this process that was leading up, we had hoped and understandably so would result in a deal with China.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well --</p><p>DOBBS: It appears that deal is hanging by a thread, if you will.</p><p>PILLSBURY: I think what you see if you examine Vice President Mike Pence's speech a few days ago, with Mike Pompeo's last night, you see a new tactic by the president that he's written about in art of the deal.</p><p>He's offering kind of an olive branch to these two speeches. Vice President Pence said that we -- we don't want decoupling of our businesses from China. We don't want to contain China.</p><p>Secretary Pompeo almost politically said we don't want a confrontation with China. So, they are trying to calm down the rhetoric of the first two years that China is a mortal threat to our country.</p><p>This might work. It's a process of shaping the Chinese over the next two weeks. We only can't their signature on the agreement, because then the enforcement mechanism began to kick in for intellectual property theft. That's the good news.</p><p>DOBBS: And December 1st also, there will be apparently --</p><p>PILLSBURY: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: -- an effort by the Chinese. They have paved the way to --</p><p>PILLSBURY: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: -- to legitimately in their view take every American company's data, files, whatever maybe contained therein for themselves. I mean, this is outrageous, Mike.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes, it is. And it's worse than that. The Chinese have a full court press now through our businessmen, our billionaires, our media, some people inside the Trump administration to cancel all the tariffs in December.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah.</p><p>PILLSBURY: That's what the Chinese want. And they claimed, they may be bluffing. I think they are bluffing. But their idea is we will walk out of these trade talks if you don't take all of these tariffs off of us.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah. The louder they squeal, I think, it's an interesting signal to try to interpret.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: I would like to get your view on something that seems to me to have escaped the Chinese surely after being too clever. They may push this president into doing exactly the thing that will insure even greater public support. And that is, take a hard line against the Chinese who are treating the United States with such abject disrespect.</p><p>PILLSBURY: That's the risk they are taking. I fear that the Chinese are underestimating President Trump's determination. I told him myself on several trips, to look back on his book in the year 2000 when he has a long section on China, the major challenge to America. And they're not going to get ahead of America on his watch.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah.</p><p>PILLSBURY: So they just don't believe it. They have too many other sources apparently here in Washington telling them that Trump is only bluffing.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, they have, yeah.</p><p>PILLSBURY: He doesn't mean it, this kind of thing.</p><p>DOBBS: The unregistered foreign agents at the Wall Street, and the Chamber of Commerce, the business roundtable and other savants of the nations --</p><p>PILLSBURY: Secretary Pompeo came pretty close to calling them out last night when he said, Chinese got this.</p><p>DOBBS: I was watching him march right up to that. And I was waiting for it. Michael, I appreciate it. Michael Pillsbury.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you much. We'd like your thoughts on all of this. Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Up next, a new bombshell showing the Obama administration colluding with Russia just a month before President Trump's inauguration? What are you talking about? We'll tell you next.</p><p>And testimony from a former White House official goes bad for the Dems. We'll be right back with that story and much more. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Documents now reveal that an Obama State Department official, Jonathon Wiener was in contact with a Russian embassy political chief one month before Donald Trump's inauguration as president.</p><p>The material obtained by Judicial Watch also shows that State Department officials continued to use unsecure Blackberries for the transmission of classified material a year after Hillary Clinton's use of her unsecured server had been discovered.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Christian Whiton. He's a senior fellow at the Center for National Interest, Former State Department Senior Advisor in both the Trump and George W. Bush administrations.</p><p>Chris, it's good to have you with us. Let's start with the Judicial Watch documents. This is stunning stuff. And that document is how important, do you believe?</p><p>CHRISTIAN WHITON, CENTER FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST SENIOR FELLOW: You know, I think it was. It pertained to points that were being generated for the Foreign Minister Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister.</p><p>So the implication being, John Kerry may have been preparing to speak with Lavrov in the whining days of his tenure at the State Department, and this was very classified and it was forwarded on unclassified systems.</p><p>This is sort of left over where I guess if you're a Democrat or one of these deep state critters, it's okay to break the law and do that, not if you're Republican, they'll throw the book at you.</p><p>But it also raise a serious question, again, and frankly, it raises more questions than it answers because we still don't know sort of the true access of Christopher Steele and the fake dossier on Donald Trump that was totally phony and how that came to be. But it looks like State Department officials may have played a role in that.</p><p>DOBBS: And Jonathan Wiener appears to have played a key role as Steele's conduit to the diplomats. And that seems important here as we are now starting to look at where the real collusion was taking place and with whom.</p><p>WHITON: Right. Why was he -- why were they connecting with senior officials at the Russian embassy? I mean, Wiener's job was supposed to be about Libya.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>WHITON: So, what was the role here? And frankly, it raises questions about Russia's role. I mean, the left have sort of assumed that Russia is trying to help Donald Trump win even though it was feckless and played no real role in doing even though it tried.</p><p>But who knows. Maybe there are elements in Russia who really were in on those conspiracy to stage a coup against the elected president of the United States.</p><p>DOBBS: Wouldn't that be something because the collusion now, it seems to be decidedly tilting toward the other party, if you will. It's unclear whom, if there is indeed collusion of any kind.</p><p>It's deeply troubling to watch this process of the Dems which they formalized today. But they can't legitimize so I'm not sure exactly what they had -- they think they're doing.</p><p>But don't they -- don't the Dems have a bit of a problem? They bring in Tim Morrison. We're hearing very clearly that Tim Morrison who resigned his post at the White House was absolutely supportive of the president and very candid about his judgment of that phone call.</p><p>WHITON: Right. And Tim has a lot of credibility. Tim is a friend of mine. He served with Former Senator Jon Kyle, in the senate as his aide. And then on the House Armed Services Committee before going to the NSC, I don't know why, Tim resigned.</p><p>But it may have just been because of conflicting advice on to whether he should or should not testify. And he spent a lot of time on Capitol Hill. But anyway, the result was not what the Democrats hoped for.</p><p>He is what -- unlike a lot of these deep state cry babies who were out there saying, oh, Donald Trump cut us out on the process on Ukraine or he didn't take my brilliant advice on Russia.</p><p>Tim was actually on the phone call. One of the few people in this mix who were and he said there was nothing illegal in that call. Of course, we already know that from the transcript. But it's nice to have a first-hand witness re-affirm that.</p><p>DOBBS: It is. And like you said, we do have a transcript and we just learned that Tim Morrison's last day on the job will be tomorrow, Chris. The -- then let's turn to this Colonel Vindman. He is an interesting fellow in large measure because of his opening statement.</p><p>In which he talked about the interagency. You talked about the consensus of the interagency and he actually was informing people what the National Security Council would abide and what it would not.</p><p>This is a man who has a very high opinion of this monolith that's rising out of the swamp called the interagency in a very low opinion of the constitution which does give foreign policy to the president to carry out.</p><p>WHITON: Yeah. What we have here is a collection of the palace units who have decided they know better than the emperor and would prefer rule in his place.</p><p>The interagency process is just a collection of bureaucrats from across the agent -- from across various national security agencies. And so you just have to ask yourself, who sets foreign policy? The constitution says the president does.</p><p>And I think most Americans think the person they elected, the president does, but you have these critters like -- what is it with these lieutenant colonels who come out of nowhere who want to have World War III with Russia.</p><p>Reminds me of Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters who, of course, you know, thinks Putin is worse than Hitler and wants to start World War III. But, you know, what this is, is really rank insubordination.</p><p>This isn't whistle blowing. You just said, what? I have feelings. I feel Donald Trump is doing something unethical. Donald Trump had no idea who this guy was four or five days ago.</p><p>DOBBS: Christian Whiton, we know who you are and we appreciate you being with us. Thanks so much.</p><p>WHITON: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Christian Whiton. Senator Mike Lee doesn't want you to know about his bill that would accelerate the flow of Indian H-1B visa workers into the United States, putting all of the progress for the American middle class and workers at peril.</p><p>Yesterday, Senator Dick Durbin called for a further look into Lee's Senate Bill 386 known as the, quote, Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. Think -- when was the last time we saw a fairness for the middle class and American workers act?</p><p>Well, this bill already passed in the House as HR 1044. The bill is supported by the Indian government as well as big tech firms like Google and Microsoft. Do I need to tell you more? Today, Lee objected and wants to work it out with Durbin behind closed doors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): I don't believe that any further factual development concerning this bill is necessary. Indeed, at this point, I believe a hearing can serve no purpose other than to delay speedy action on this important reform.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: In Lee's judgment, obviously he thinks the bill is so important that it should pass in the dark of night with unanimous consent which would not require a vote by a single senator.</p><p>Durbin is trying to save his hide and the American worker perhaps, perhaps by objecting and they want to work together to avoid a hearing. You know, the public. That messy bunch of voters we all represent.</p><p>They want to do it in the dark of night without our witnessing what's happening and who is doing what to this country. Senate Bill 386, we're going to watch. We may not have any influence at all. But I hope the president of the United States stands up against this and tells them to withdraw that bill.</p><p>It's ignorance, it is utter hypocrisy and needs not advance at all. Up next, the hypocrisy of the radical left's impeachment resolution. We take it up with Tammy Bruce right after this quick break. Stay with us, we're coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: House Speaker Pelosi today, called the Dems' sham impeachment inquiry the sworn duty of congress. Here's what she had to say on the floor of the House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE: Nobody, I doubt anybody in this place, or anybody that you know comes to congress to take the oath of office, comes to congress to impeach the president of the United States unless his actions are jeopardizing our honoring our oath of office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Pelosi forgot about Congresswoman Tlaib, Rashida Tlaib said these just hours after she was sworn into office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI): When your son looks at you and says, mama, look, you won. Please don't win. And I said, baby they don't because we're going to go in there, we're going to teach them --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Another of Pelosi's caucus members, Congressman Al Green, he has also tried and failed three times in two years, to get the House to vote on impeachment.</p><p>The last time, back in July. It was rejected 332 to 95. Well, joining us now, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times columnist, Fox Business Contributor, the host of Fox Nations Get, Tammy Bruce, great to have you with us.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Hey there. Good evening.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with this process. And the Radical Dems seem to have - - I guess, the word is unhinged. They have really lost sight of what they are doing here and the consequences I can only believe.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, we've seen that from the start for quite some time now. So this is not a one off, it's not a surprise. We've seen it, of course, in their reaction during the campaign. Certainly, right after -- the day after -- well, the day of the inaugural.</p><p>It was the headline I think of the Washington Post about now, the impeachment begins. So the American people have seen this bizarre kind of activity meant to, of course, negate their vote, to negate their existence and their importance.</p><p>DOBBS: They have been trying to overthrow this president since 2016. They have done so openly and they have -- and the national media have sort supported that posture by saying, they've Trump's derangement syndrome, the poor babies can't get over the election results.</p><p>And all I can think when I hear that crap is asking two candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump whether they would accept the results of the election. And Clinton was absolutely sure about the facts she could have accept it.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, of course. And look, I've said this before to my radio audience, and I think it's worth repeating. That this impeachment dynamic is expected.</p><p>That it would actually be necessary if we were correct in 2016 because Donald Trump's election was in large part because we knew something was wrong with Washington.</p><p>That they had stopped listening to us. That we became like collateral damage in their games. That we needed a disrupter. Someone who would make the difference and so we get the Russia hoax dossier, but now, of course, we would have an impeachment.</p><p>DOBBS: The insurance policy.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, yes. And I would -- and, of course, they will impeach him. It's the ends justify the means. But we have to realize that this confirms that we were correct in 2016. I believe the president understands that and this is part and parcel of what we have to expect as we clean out the dumpster fire of Washington, D.C.</p><p>And I'm looking forward to it and when you see it with that perspective it makes sense. And it's heartbreaking, but the founders set us up with a system that allows to us make sure that these kinds of shenanigans don't succeed.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, I would quibble with you on only a part. And that is that we needed any validation whatsoever that we have chosen the right person to lead the country.</p><p>When you look at everything he has done, in three years he's a historic president. What's wrong with this country? As you correctly state, we sensed, we thought, we suspected what was going on with this country, but we had no idea. How bad --</p><p>BRUCE: And boy, did we get proof. Did we get proof.</p><p>DOBBS: Tammy Bruce, we'll be with us right after this quick break. Stay with us, we're coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: We're back with Tammy Bruce. And Tammy, what we're watching in Washington is disgusting. The Radical Dems are appalling. It's a polarized country. But the fact of the matter is, it's evident, who the bad actors are here and their names are Pelosi and Schiff and the list goes on.</p><p>BRUCE: It couldn't be more clear. And you know what it is, it's a call to courage for the American people. Especially those who may have been on the edge and don't know. But it's a good time to be alive. It's a good time to be us. And we have a challenge and we're up for it.</p><p>DOBBS: And that challenge is, president -- and it is a clear and present danger. I don't think as I said a few times, calling it a hoax, calling it a witch hunt. I almost trivialize --</p><p>BRUCE: I agree.</p><p>DOBBS: -- the mortal combat that we're engaged in, in the swamp. Tammy Bruce, always great to have you with us.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks so much. Appreciate it. That's it for us tonight. Thanks for joining us. See you tomorrow night, right here, pretty please. Good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2019103101cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD8-4X01-JB20-G00F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 31, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Impeachment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade War</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stocks</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000984</classCode><className>JUDGES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTg1QUIzNkIwNzk5NDQ4NzhGMDdDQjVGNEYyRjY5OTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURENzJGNTEyQzM0NEREQUI2RkVCRTM4RTc1RTZBREU</classCode><className>Judges</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QD4</classCode><className>NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;

My name is Meredith Whittaker and I am the Co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University. AI Now is the first university research institute dedicated to studying the social implications of artificial intelligence and algorithmic technologies (\"AI\"). n1 Our work examines the rapid proliferation of AI systems through core social domains such as criminal justice, health care, employment, and education. In particular we focus on concerns in the areas of bias and inclusion, safety and critical infrastructure, rights and liberties, and labor. As we identify problems in each of these spaces, we work to address them through robust research investigations, community engagement, and key policy interventions.</p><p>When Kate Crawford and I founded AI Now in 2016, we were just beginning to see both the extreme promises of AI as well as the extreme risks. Our annual reports have chronicled these risks, issues, and concerns, and I can say with confidence that they have only increased over time. n2 From education, to healthcare, to law enforcement, to hiring and worker management, and well beyond, the role of AI in our core social institutions is expanding, both in government and the private sector. AI is shaping access to resources and opportunity, with profound implications for hundreds of millions of Americans. These systems are being used to judge who should be released on bail; n3 to automate disease diagnosis in patients; n4 to amplify mass surveillance efforts; n5 and to hire, monitor and manage workers. n6 n7 These are only a handful of examples that provide a view of the power that AI is quietly gaining over our lives and institutions.</p><p>At the same time that AI systems are proliferating and concentrating the power to impact our lives, they are slipping further away from core democratic protections such as due process and other forms of accountability. Embedded within technological and legal \"black boxes,\" AI systems raise many questions and provide few true answers.</p><p>In light of this, it is urgent that we address this accountability gap and ensure these technologies advance the values of fairness and justice that this institution and many others are dedicated to upholding.</p><p>The Emerging Problem Space</p><p>Thanks to researchers and investigative journalists, we have significant and alarming evidence of the way in which AI systems encode bias, produce harm, accelerate environmental degradation and the climate crisis, n8 n9 avoid established accountability processes, and differ dramatically from many of the marketing claims made by AI companies.</p><p>Take for example the simple act of listening. Many AI systems, such as Amazon's Echo device are constantly recording every sound within range of their microphones. This is, in theory, so they can respond to user voice commands. But they are equally capable of other, unauthorized recordings. n10 Even when welcomed into our homes, voice recognition systems are far from objective in what they \"hear\" and whose voices count. For example, some systems have been shown to recognize more masculine sounding voices better than feminine voices; n11 such bias also exists in facial recognition systems that fail to recognize black and transgendered faces; n12 n13 automated hiring systems that discriminate against women candidates; medical diagnostic systems don't work for dark skinned patients; n14 sentencing algorithms that discriminate against black defendants; and the list goes on.</p><p>But even when these systems don't explicitly encode bias, they can still cause harm. For example, the ACLU tested the use of Amazon's Facial Recognition system, finding that 28 members of Congress were falsely matched with mugshots of those previously arrested for a crime. n15 The problems raised by the application of facial recognition and other AI systems won't be solved by ensuring the technology is 100% accurate. The application of AI to monitor, track, and control vulnerable populations raises fundamental issues, reminding us that questions of justice will not be solved simply by adjusting a technical system.</p><p>Even in the face of mounting evidence, the rapid integration of AI into sensitive social domains continues. Government agencies are increasingly using AI and algorithmic systems to assess beneficiaries of social services and manage benefit allocation. In many cases, the outcome of these experiments has been harmful and even deadly to the people such programs are meant to serve. n16 For example, several states have turned to automation for Medicaid benefit allocation. In many cases, these systems have failed due to flaws in the system itself, resulting in serious harm and multi-million dollar lawsuits. n17 In Arkansas, such a system was used to calculate how much home healthcare chronically Hi Medicaid patients would receive. Due to an error, the system was significantly underprovisioning many people who required such care to survive. Patients were left to sit in their own waste, unable to access food when they were hungry, or to turn themselves to prevent bedsores. n18 If Legal Aid of Arkansas had not brought a case, and ultimately audited the system, it's possible that such harm would have persisted unchecked. n19</p><p>It is not an overstatement to claim that the integration of AI is poised to reshape core domains.</p><p>In education, we're seeing the implementation of facial recognition, n20 automated mental health monitoring, n21 and AI-based 'learning programs' that promise to track student progress and direct teachers. n22 These are often sold to school districts by vendors making claims about technical capabilities that, when we're able to examine them, frequently fall short. For example, a company called Gaggle licenses services to school districts that it claims increase safety and automatically detect students with mental health issues. n23 Gaggle's system requires blanket surveillance of student social media and private student communications sent using school networks. It uses AI to analyze the content of these communications, and to flag threats and identify students at risk. But on examination, it becomes clear that much of what gaggle detects are \"minor violations,\" including use of profanity in private communications. n24 The company's claims that it helps students and improves safety are not firmly substantiated.</p><p>We are left with an understanding of Gaggle's sales pitch, but without answers to a number of socially significant questions that its technology raises: we don't know how a student might contest the company's interpretation of their communications, whether parents were fully informed before consenting to such surveillance, the way in which such monitoring may chill communication between peers, or how Gaggle's system might encode bias that could harm students with disabilities, students of color, or LGBTQ students (although we do know that in one school district the system flagged over a dozen students for communications that included the word \"gay\"). n25 Gaggle is one example among many in which AI is being applied in ways that have profound and life-changing implications without first ensuring that it is safe, helpful, unbiased, and doesn't pose risks to those it's meant to serve.</p><p>Corporate Control and Secrecy</p><p>AI technology affecting the lives and opportunities of hundreds of millions of people is being shaped by the incentives, values, and interests of a small handful of private companies.</p><p>AI is not a new set of technologies, and many of the core techniques that power AI systems, including neural nets, have been around for decades. The biggest changes recently have not been wholly new AI techniques (although we have seen improvements and innovations). What has changed drastically is the availability of massive amounts of data and vast computational resources. It's this that is behind the AI boom we see today. These are assets that only a handful of major tech companies have, and very few others do. This is one of the reasons why the US government contracts with companies like Amazon, instead of building its own infrastructure and AI. Without the legal protections afforded the private sector around privacy, and existing market reach and infrastructural economies of scale, it's virtually impossible to obtain the resources needed to create AI from scratch.</p><p>While there are many AI startups, most have significant budget allocated to licensing computational infrastructure from one of the big tech companies - namely Amazon, Microsoft, or Google. Most also struggle to acquire data, often scraping the web, buying data from data brokers, or signing deals in one or another domain (say, healthcare or education) to get access to relevant datasets. In short, the startup AI ecosystem we see today ultimately relies on the infrastructure provided by big companies, and thus the AI industry points back to a few large players.</p><p>This means that much of what we know about AI is written by the public relations and marketing departments of these same companies. They highlight benevolent uses and public benefit, often showcasing prototypes that haven't been validated beyond narrow test cases, n26 while remaining silent about the application of AI to fossil fuel extraction, n27 weapons development, n28 mass surveillance, n29 or the problems of bias and error. n30 We know about many of these more troubling cases thanks to researchers, investigative journalists, and whistleblowers.</p><p>When regulators, researchers, and the public seek to learn more, and to research and understand the potential harms of these systems, they are faced with structural barriers. The companies developing and deploying AI often exploit corporate secrecy laws, making testing, auditing, and monitoring extremely difficult, if not impossible. n31</p><p>This structural secrecy, combined with overbroad laws used to threaten scientists, journalists, and algorithmic auditors, n32 makes it very difficult to validate company marketing promises. Access to fundamental information about AI systems, like where, how, and to what end they're being used, are classed as proprietary and confidential. Often even workers within these firms don't know where, and how, technology they contribute to will ultimately be applied. n33</p><p>Lack of Accountability to Those Most at Risk</p><p>This pattern is particularly concerning given that those who will be most affected by such systems are rarely part of decision-making leading to the purchase and implementation of such systems, and often lack power to challenge subsequent uses. Tenants in rent-stabilized buildings in Brooklyn only learned of their landlord's plan to install a StoneLock brand facial recognition entry system after he made the decision to procure and install the system. A letter from New York State's Homes and Community Renewal (HCR), the agency overseeing rent-stabilized housing, informed tenants of the landlord's application to install the system. The tenants pushed back, citing well-documented problems of bias and inaccuracy, as well as the privacy concerns inherent in providing sensitive biometric data to a landlord with a history of punitive tenant surveillance. n34 Currently, the plan remains in limbo, with a lawyer representing the tenants noting that HCR does not have the jurisdiction or authority to adequately protect tenants, and encouraging the agency to reject the landlord's application given the lack of meaningful protections. n35</p><p>Agreements between a vendor selling such a system on the one hand, and a business or institution with an interest in using it on the other, are most often reached behind closed doors.</p><p>In the case of many large tech companies, the fact that such an agreement has been reached may itself be considered confidential. If the Brooklyn buildings had not been rent-stabilized, and thus had not required an application to a state agency to implement such changes, it's possible that the tenants would only have learned after a contract between the landlord and the vendor had been signed. In most cases, there's no requirement that such agreements take the interests of people who will be tracked, classified, and surveilled by AI systems into account. And since these systems are often integrated in ways that aren't visible - as part of larger infrastructures -those affected by them may not know that an AI system had a role in making a determination that impacted their life. n36</p><p>Lack of Diversity and Its Implications</p><p>The technology affecting the lives and opportunities of billions of people is being shaped by the incentives, values, and interests of a small handful of private companies. And these companies are notoriously non-diverse. AI Now conducted a year-long study on the AI industry's diversity and inclusion practices, and the results are bleak. Women make up 10% of research staff at Google and just 15% at Facebook, n37 and the picture is worse when you examine available data on non-white workers. Only 2.5% of Google's employees are black, and only 3.6% are latinx, while Facebook and Microsoft are each at 4% for black workers and 6% for latinx workers. n38 We have no data on trans workers and other gender minorities, but anecdotal evidence is grim. This extends beyond industry. In academia, over 80% of AI professors are men, and only 18% of authors at leading AI conferences are women. n39 To give an example of how stark the diversity problem is, when BlackInAI co-founder, Timnit Gebru, first attended the major AI conference NeurIPS in 2016, she counted 6 black attendees out of 8,500 total. n40</p><p>The diversity crisis in the AI industry means that women, people of color, gender minorities, and other marginalized populations are excluded from contributing to the design of AI systems, from shaping how these systems function, and from determining what problems these systems are tasked with solving. n41 This influences which AI products get built, who they are designed to serve, and who benefits from their development. And in the case of AI, these determinations affect billions of people beyond company walls.</p><p>AI systems have evidenced a persistent pattern of gender and race-based discrimination (among other attributes and forms of identity), and in most cases, such bias mirrors and replicates existing structures of inequality. n42 To review a few examples: sentencing algorithms discriminate against black defendants; n43 chatbots easily adopt racist and misogynistic language when trained on online discourse; n44 and Uber's facial recognition doesn't work for trans drivers, locking them out of work. n45 Here we see a common theme: when these systems fail, they fail in ways that harm those who are already marginalized. I have yet to encounter an AI system that was biased against white men as a standalone identity.</p><p>Such bias can be the result of faulty training data, problems in how the system was designed or configured, n46 or bad or biased applications in real world contexts. In all cases it signals that the environments where a given system was created and envisioned didn't recognize or reflect on the contexts within which these systems would be deployed. Or, that those creating and maintaining these systems did not have the experience or background to understand the diverse environments and identities that would be impacted by a given system. Recent research from AI Now's Rashida Richardson shows vendors selling predictive policing systems failed to account for potential biases in the data such systems relied on, and thus to prevent harm. n47 In at least nine jurisdictions, predictive policing tools were being used or developed on data that was generated during periods where the police departments engaged in corrupt, racially biased, or unlawful policing practices and policies. Police data reflects the local practices, policies, and environment where it was collected, as there are no national standards on how police data is collected or used. This research showed that reliance on such \"dirty data\" increases the risk that these police technologies will reproduce and perpetuate past discrimination..This is another example of how the failure by vendors and developers to account for history and context risks encoding bias directly into their systems. And thus risk the lives and futures of those wrongfully profiled and targeted.</p><p>Beyond Technical Solutions</p><p>Both within the spaces where AI is being created, and in the logic of how AI systems are designed, the costs of bias, harassment, and discrimination are borne by the same people: gender minorities, people of color, and other under-represented groups. Similarly, the benefits of such systems - from profit to efficiency - accrue primarily to those already in positions of power, who again tend to be white, educated, and male. n48</p><p>This points to a problem that goes beyond technical fixes for issues of AI bias and discrimination. AI systems are powerful. They allow those who use them to profoundly influence people's lives, across multiple domains. And the ability to access and use these systems is not evenly distributed. Given the expense of creating AI, the cost of maintaining these systems, and the market incentives driving their development, it is almost always those who already have power who are in the position of applying AI systems, often on those who don't. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had used a risk assessment algorithm at the border since 2013, meant to help determine whether an immigrant should be detailed or released on bond. An academic study examining the algorithm found that it had been modified a number of times in an attempt to mitigate the overly-punitive behavior of ICE agents, n49 but this technical bias fix failed to solve the problem. Then, in 2017 ICE modified the algorithm again, to only suggest detain, and never release. The impact of this change was profound. ICE detained over 43,000 immigrants with no criminal history in 2017, more than three times as many as the previous year. n50</p><p>Here we see the way in which the problems of AI go beyond bias and inaccuracy at the technical level, to fundamental issues of power and control. This means our approach to these problems must expand beyond the technical, asking who is harmed by these systems? Who benefits? And who gets to decide?</p><p>Ethics Is Not Enough</p><p>In the face of evidence of bias, error, and misuse of AI systems, we have seen tech companies and the AI field beyond adopt ethical principles and guidelines, and form ethical oversight committees and boards. It is encouraging that those creating such powerful technologies are recognizing their potential harms and moving to address these.</p><p>However, these codes, guidelines and ethics boards do not substitute for meaningful accountability and oversight. To date we have no examples where such ethical proclamations are backed by public enforcement mechanisms, nor any that attach clear consequences for failing to live up to ethical ideals. While the public may be able to compare a decision already made by an AI company to its guiding principles, this allows no insight into decision-making, nor does it give anyone outside of the company the power to reverse or guide such a decision.</p><p>Such a turn to ethics may also serve to stall movements toward more substantive regulation and public accountability measures, working to deflect criticism by acknowledging that problems exist, without ceding any power to regulate or transform the way technology is developed and applied. n51</p><p>The case of Google is instructive here. Among the list of applications that Google promises not to pursue as a part of its AI Principles are \"technologies whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.\" n52 This commitment was tested in 2018 when whistleblowers revealed that the company was quietly developing a censored version of its search engine (which relies extensively on AI capabilities) for the Chinese market, code-named Dragonfly. n53 Human rights organizations condemned the project as a violation of human rights law, and as such, a violation of Google's AI principles. n54 n55 While there are indications that the project has been cancelled following Google worker organizing and public outcry, its continued development in the face of the company's principles was never explained, and the principles themselves seem to have had little impact on directing the company to reconsider the effort. n56</p><p>Organizing and Accountability</p><p>Over the past year, we have seen mounting pushback, as organizing and resistance to the development and application of AI systems has grown. Amazon Warehouse workers in Minneapolis protested Amazon's automated management system, pushing back against a system of worker control that continually extracted more labor at the expense of workers' health and well-being. n57 Similarly, Uber drivers organized a nationwide strike, protesting the centralized, algorithmic platform that arbitrarily cuts driver wages without recourse. n58 And even students at a school where Facebook-backed \"personalized\" education systems were used staged protests, demanding less dehumanizing forms of education. n59</p><p>We've also seen pushback inside tech companies. Workers across the industry have organized and protested unethical and secretive projects, n60 n61 n62 n63 n64 demanding to have a say in what they build, n65 and connecting Al's ethical issues with problems of workplace discrimination, harassment, and abuse. n66</p><p>Currently, such organizing and activism comprises one of the primary modes of accountability working to check the biased and oppressive deployment of AI technologies, and to improve diversity and equity across the industry. n67 n68 n69 n70 I have proudly organized with fellow tech workers at Google and beyond, recognizing the urgent need for such accountability. n71 What is clear to those of us who have been researching these issues, and those of us familiar with the tech industry, is that we need much more. Accountability, transparency, oversight, and measures that ensure those most at risk of harm are at the heart of AI decision making. n72 n73</p><p>The Path Forward: AI Now's Policy Recommendations for Congress:</p><p>Congress has a window to act, and the time is now. Powerful AI systems are currently reshaping our lives and social institutions in ways that we aren't able to measure or contest. These systems are developed and deployed by a handful of private companies whose market interests don't always align with the public good, and who shield these systems from accountability behind claims of corporate secrecy. When we are able to examine these systems, too often we find that they are biased and inaccurate in ways that replicate historical patterns of discrimination.</p><p>It is imperative that lawmakers regulate to ensure that these systems are accountable, accurate, contestable, and that those most at risk of harm have a say in how, and whether, they are used. As first steps toward this goal, AI Now recommends that lawmakers:</p><p>1. Require Algorithmic Impact Assessments in both Public and Private Sectors before AI Systems are Acquired and Used</p><p>In 2018, AI Now published an Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) framework, which offers a means for assessing algorithmic systems in government, including AI based systems, and providing the public with transparency and decision-making power. n74 AIAs draw directly from impact assessment frameworks in environmental protection, human rights, privacy, and data protection policy domains by combining public agency review and public input. n75 When implemented in government, AIAs provide both the agency and the public the opportunity to evaluate the potential impacts of the adoption of an algorithmic system before the agency has committed to its use. AIAs also require ongoing monitoring and review, recognizing the dynamic contexts within which such systems are applied.</p><p>The framework has been adopted in Canada, and is being considered by local, state, and national governments globally. n76 Though it was originally proposed to address concerns associated with government use of automated decision-making systems, the framework should also be mandated for private companies, ensuring review and public engagement before a product or service is used in ways that impact the public. This can provide companies opportunities to assess and possibly mitigate adverse or unanticipated outcomes during the development process. It also provides the government and public with greater transparency, along with a means to strengthen existing consumer accountability mechanisms. By requiring that proposed technologies be reviewed by the communities who will be most affected by their use, AIAs work to empower those most at risk, and to encourage the development of safer and more ethical technologies.</p><p>2. Require Technology Companies to Waive Trade Secrecy and Other Legal Claims That Hinder Oversight and Accountability Mechanisms</p><p>Corporate secrecy laws are a barrier to oversight, accountability, and due process when they are used to obscure technologies used in ways that affect the public. They can inhibit necessary government oversight and enforcement of consumer protection laws, n77 which contribute to the \"black box effect,\" making it hard to assess bias, contest decisions, or remedy errors. Anyone procuring these technologies for use in the public sector should have the right to demand vendors waive these claims before entering into any agreements. Additionally, limiting the use of these legal claims across the board will help facilitate better oversight by state and federal consumer protection agencies and enforcement of false and deceptive practice laws.</p><p>3. Require Public Disclosure of Technologies That Are Involved in Any Decisions About Consumers by Name and Vendor/s</p><p>Those most affected by Al's use in sensitive social domains often don't know that a given system was used, or where and how it might have shaped their lives. Consumers deserve to know about which Al systems are making decisions about them, or affecting the types of services, resources, or opportunities made available to them. Requiring disclosure of which Al systems are used, in what context, along with which companies developed such systems, will provide consumers with the notice necessary to enforce their due process rights. We need to ensure meaningful insight and transparency. This is especially urgent given that infrastructure owned by the major technology companies is often licensed and used by other businesses. Large technology companies license Al application program interfaces (APIs), or \"Al as a service\" to third parties, who apply them to one or another purpose. n78 These business relationships, in which one organization repurposes potentially flawed and biased Al systems created by large technology companies, are rarely disclosed to the public, and even the fact that there is such a relationship is often protected under nondisclosure agreements. lt is hard, if not impossible, to simply know if an Al model is being used in a given context, let alone to know that such a model was created by Facebook, Google, or Amazon. Thus, understanding the implications of bad, biased, or misused models is effectively impossible, especially for those most at risk.</p><p>4. Enhance Whistleblower Protections and Protections for Conscientious Objectors within Technology Companies</p><p>Organizing and resistance by tech workers has emerged as a force for accountability and ethical oversight. n79 Alongside organizers, whistleblowers have provided a crucial public benefit, revealing products and problems that may not otherwise be visible to relevant oversight bodies, or even to the majority of workers within a given company. Whistleblowers in the technology industry can be a crucial component to government oversight, serving the public interest by revealing troubling and unethical initiatives poised to affect millions of people. In light of their service, and the critical role they are playing, they should be provided enhanced protections.</p><p>n1 About, AI Now Institute, <url normalizedValue=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/about.html/\">https://ainowinstitute.org/about.html/</url>.</p><p>n2 Kate Crawford et al., The AI Now Report 2016 (Sept. 2016), <url normalizedValue=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2016_Report.html\">https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2016_Report.html</url>),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2017_Report.html\">https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2017_Report.html</url>), 80(4), pp. 385-400,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://eprints.qut.edu.au/112749/3/112749a.pdf;\">https://eprints.qut.edu.au/112749/3/112749a.pdf;</url>AI Now Inst., Litigating Algorithms: Challenging Government Use of Algorithmic Decision Systems (Sept. 2018),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/litigatingalgorithms.html\">https://ainowinstitute.org/litigatingalgorithms.html</url>),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://anatomyof.ai\">https://anatomyof.ai</url>; AI Now Inst., Algorithmic Accountability Policy Toolkit (Oct. 2018),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/aap-toolkit.pdf\">https://ainowinstitute.org/aap-toolkit.pdf</url>;       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/litigatingalgorithms.pdf\">https://ainowinstitute.org/litigatingalgorithms.pdf</url>; Meredith Whittaker et al., The AI Now Report 2018 (Dec. 2018),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2018_Report.pdf\">https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2018_Report.pdf</url>; Rashida Richardson, Jason M.

Today, however, in this new era of strategic competition, the U.S. confronts a unique, perhaps unprecedented challenge to this primacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ven China's continued exploitation of the openness of the U.S. innovation ecosystem, from Silicon Valley to our nation's leading universities, it is imperative to pursue targeted countermeasures against practices that are illegal or, at best, problematic.</p><p>At the same time, our justified concerns about constraining the transfer of sensitive and strategic technologies to China must not distract our attention from the long-term, fundamental challenge-- to enhance U.S. competitiveness, at a time when China is starting to become a true powerhouse and would-be superpower in science and technology.</p><p>China's Quest for Indigenous Innovation</p><p>China's attempts to advance indigenous innovation have often leveraged and been accelerated by tech transfer that is undertaken through both licit and illicit means. This history and these techniques of industrial espionage have been extensively documented, and cases abound. n1 Some of the more notorious examples include the theft of data on the F-35 n2 and recent Chinese targeting of the semiconductor industry, which has involved targeted poaching of engineers and the theft of intellectual property, n3, n4 as well as attempted and successful acquisitions. n5</p><p>At the same time, there have been well-funded and significant initiatives within China to build up indigenous technology and innovation resources. Even fairly recently, it would not have been inaccurate to say that Chinese \"indigenous\" innovation seemed to be an oxymoron, due to this heavy reliance upon foreign technologies. However, it would be arrogant, even dangerous, to claim today that China \"can't innovate,\" when there is such abundant evidence to the contrary.</p><p>Beyond the hype and fear, China's ambitions of technological dominance should be taken skeptically, but seriously. In particular, the Chinese government has launched sixteen SandT \"megaprojects,\" na increased funding for basic research, nb and prioritized the education and recruitment of talent. n6, n7 China aspires and has the potential to emerge as a leader in new frontiers of innovation, including artificial intelligence and quantum technologies.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence:</p><p>Although its ambitions to \"lead the world\" in AI may seem grandiose, China could emerge as a true 'AI superpower.' n8 By all available indicators, from patents to publications and investments, China is already emerging as a global center of AI innovation. nc As early as 2013, China's AI publications overtook those of the U.S. to become the world's most cited papers. n9, n10 As of 2017, China produced 27.7% of the academic research on AI published in the world. Chinese companies also appear to be overtaking their U.S. competitors and counterparts in AI-related patent applications, including in deep learning. n11 Beyond billions in state funding, nd China is also attracting a sizable and increasing proportion of global investment in AI, which amounted to $27 billion in 2017, constituting 60% of the world total across the past five years. n12, n13 In 2017, Chinese AI start-ups received nearly 50% of global funding to start-ups, surpassing the U.S. n14</p><p>The Chinese government has prioritized AI at the highest levels and is dedicating strong state support to its advancement. The New Generation AI Development Plan characterized this strategic technology as a \"new focal point of international competition,\" declaring China's intention to emerge as the world's \"premier AI innovation center\" by 2030. n15 The Three-Year Action Plan to Promote the Development of New-Generation AI Industry (2018--2020) called for China to \"establish international competitive advantage\" in AI products by 2020. n16 China's central and many local governments are providing high and ever-rising levels of funding for the research, development, and commercialization of AI applications and next-generation technologies. For instance, the city of Tianjin alone has created a new $16 billion fund for AI. n17 At the same time, China's policies seek to create a robust foundation for innovation through developing standards and regulatory frameworks and supporting the availability of data, testing, and cloud platforms. n18, n19</p><p>If there is a U.S.-China \"AI arms race\" today, then the primary battlefield is talent. ne, n20 Confronting major shortfalls in AI talent relative to the intense demands, the Chinese government is aggressively advancing a range of training and educational initiatives. n21 As of late 2017, China had an estimated 18,232 AI talents, or a mere 8.9% of the world's total, by one estimate, ranking behind the U.S., nf which is estimated to account for 13.9% of the world's AI talent. n22 According to data from LinkedIn, n23 of the approximately 1.9 million AI engineers worldwide, nearly one million reside in the US, while just about 50,000 are in China. n24 In response to this gap, China's Ministry of Education released a plan to build up AI as a discipline in Chinese higher educational institutions, n25 including through establishing new AI academic and research institutes at universities throughout China. n26 Of note, Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures has partnered with the Ministry of Education and Peking University to launch a new program that plans to train at least 500 AI teachers and 5000 AI students in top universities in five years. n27 At the same time, Chinese state talent plans continue to concentrate on recruitment. n28 China may lag behind the U.S. in talent for now, but it is committed to developing the requisite human resources.</p><p>China's 'national champions' -- Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and iFlytek -- are global leaders in AI that also benefit from strong state support, while contributing to national priorities for AI development. For instance, Baidu is leading China's National Engineering Laboratory for Deep Learning Technologies and Applications and n29 iFlytek, which makes 'China's Siri,' is leading the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Intelligence. n30 At the same time, these players are heavily investing in research and development, while undertaking investments and acquisitions within China and worldwide. For instance, Baidu's RandD budget in 2017 was about $2 billion, n31 and Alibaba plans to invest $15 billion into disruptive technologies, including artificial intelligence and quantum technologies, through its new DAMO (Discovery, Adventure, Momentum, and Outlook) Academy. n32 These champions will also undertake the development of new open innovation platforms in AI: Baidu will be responsible for autonomous vehicles, Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) for smart cities, Tencent for medical imaging and iFlytek for smart voice technologies. n33 The platforms will be piloted in the Xiong'an New Area, a development southwest of Beijing that is intended to be a futuristic demonstration of Chinese innovation and to showcase AI technologies and applications in action. n34 In addition, to advance China's national strategy of military-civil fusion, n35 Baidu is partnering with the China Electronics Technology Group (CETC), a state-owned defense conglomerate, through the Joint Laboratory for Intelligent Command and Control Technologies to pursue applications of big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, in military command and information systems. n36 Beyond these champions, a diverse and extensive ecosystem of AI start-ups is emerging. As of May 2018, there are an estimated 4,040 AI enterprises in China, of which 1,070 of those companies are in Beijing alone. n37, n38</p><p>Quantum Technologies:</p><p>China aspires to lead in quantum science and to pioneer the development of a range of quantum technologies that could prove transformative. Chinese scientists have launched the world's first quantum satellite, broken world records in quantum computing, n39 and even claimed to achieve rapid progress in the development of quantum radar. n40 The Chinese government has launched a national megaproject in quantum communications and computing, prioritizing these technologies for advances by 2030. n41 Building upon a history of steady support for basic research and development, China's quantum innovation ecosystem is dynamic and characterized by integration between academia, industry, and the military. China is in the process of constructing a National Laboratory for Quantum Information Science, n42, n43 which has received 7 billion RMB ($1.06 billion) in funding to start. ng, n44 This new national laboratory will pursue advances in quantum technologies, including computing, while reportedly engaging in research \"of immediate use\" to the Chinese military. n45 Meanwhile, Alibaba has partnered with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to establish its new Quantum Computing Laboratory, n46 and Baidu has also recently established an Institute of Quantum Computing. n47 Although China has not emerged as a clear leader quantum computing, Chinese researchers may catch up and surpass their competitors in the decades-long marathon to develop a fully functional quantum computer. At the same time, the Chinese defense industry is actively engaged in the development of quantum radar, imaging, and navigation technologies that could have more direct and immediate military applications.</p><p>China's Tactics for Tech Transfer</p><p>Despite such estimable progress in innovation, it is critical to recognize that also China continues to confront considerable challenges, including a lack of talent and core technologies. nh These obstacles motivate the \"going out\" of Chinese enterprises and their attempts to facilitate the \"bringing in\" of tech and talent back to China. n48 Although China is seeking to progress beyond reliance on tech transfer to engage in truly original innovation, state-driven attempts to leverage foreign innovation ecosystems will likely remain quite prevalent, in the U.S. and worldwide, for the foreseeable future. These efforts constitute a complex and often opaque landscape of activities, and this testimony does not attempt to be comprehensive in its coverage of them. For instance, it is clear that, despite the 2015 Xi-Obama agreement, Chinese cyber espionage, including that undertaken for purposes of IP theft, has continued, n49 as in the recent troubling compromise of a Navy contractor by hackers from the Ministry of State Security. n50 Beyond such illicit tactics, I seek to highlight a series of relevant examples of tactics and dynamics of tech transfer that will merit further consideration going forward. My remarks will concentrate on Chinese investments, incubators, and acquisitions focused on strategic technologies; the targeting and exploitation of U.S. academia and universities; and questionable research and commercial collaborations.</p><p>Investments, Incubators, and Acquisitions:</p><p>Chinese investments, as well as tech incubators and targeted acquisitions, can enable access to U.S. technologies that conveys a level of risk, but also opportunities for U.S. companies as well. n51 In many respects, the extensive engagement and collaboration in innovation between the U.S. and China, often characterized by open exchanges of ideas, talent, and technologies, can be mutually beneficial in enriching and accelerating innovation in both countries. n52 However, to the extent that the Chinese government seeks to direct and exploit these efforts with levels of involvement that are often opaque or obscured, it is worth reevaluating the risks and benefits of these 'entanglements.'</p><p>For instance, the dramatic increase in levels of Chinese investment in strategic technologies within the past several years reflects the confluence of state priorities and commercial enthusiasm that can be very difficult to differentiate in practice. Between 2012 and mid-2017, China-based investors engaged in tech investments of $19 billion in the U.S., across 641 deals, focusing on AI, robotics, and augmented or virtual reality, according to data from CB Insights. n53 Not all Chinese investments are risky or problematic -- particularly if there are safeguards to limit access to IP in place -- and this influx of capital can also be beneficial to U.S. start-ups that may otherwise struggle to receive adequate funding. n54 However, the access and insights that investment can enable, including when an investor takes on a board position in the company, can enhance situation awareness in ways that might inform future targeting and acquisitions of sensitive technologies.</p><p>These trends and dynamics in Chinese investments will merit much more extensive analysis and consideration, given the scope, scale, and variety of these activities. Although the majority of Chinese venture capital investment in the U.S. is assessed to be private and primarily financially-motivated, certain investments can be linked to or directed by state priorities in ways that are not necessarily transparent. n55 As scrutiny of Chinese investments in Silicon Valley increases, pursuant to proposed updates to CFIUS, certain investors and venture capital funds will look to obscure further the origins of their funding and their connections to China or the Chinese government in ways that may render balanced evaluation of risk even more challenging. Certain funds are directly guided and supported by the central or local governments or elements of China's defense science and technology ecosystem, such that their engagements with U.S. start-ups may serve to draw their tech and talent back into it. While a full review of relevant investors would be beyond the scope of this testimony, several examples serve to illustrate the focus and nature of these activities.</p><p>* The China Investment Corporation, China's national sovereign wealth fund, has sought to pursue greater access and investments in the United States, n56 including in Silicon Valley, where it invested in Unity Technologies, a platform for virtual/augmented reality. n57</p><p>* Danhua Capital DHVC ni was established in 2013 in Silicon Valley by the Zhongguancun (ZGC) Development Group, n58 which is a state-owned enterprise of the Beijing municipal government. n59</p><p>* DHVC, which manages total investments of $600 million as of fall 2017, n60 has made 137 investments in total as of July 2018, with a focus on emerging and disruptive technologies, including Meta, a leading company in augmented reality. n61</p><p>* DHVC affiliates have taken on board-related and/or advisory positions on a number of start-ups after investment. n62</p><p>* According to its co-founder, the fund is committed to \"narrowing the gap\" in technological development between China and the U.S. n63</p><p>* HEDA Ventures, established and supported by the Hangzhou government's Economic and Technology Development Zone, n64 has invested in disruptive innovations, including in the biotech sector, such as Paragon Genomics. n65</p><p>* This fund received $150 million in total to start, and its objectives include to encourage overseas talents to settle in Hangzhou and to support the upgrading and transformation of China's domestic industries. n66</p><p>* Qihoo 360, China's leading cyber security company, which is closely linked to the Chinese military and government, n67 has established a venture capital fund in Silicon Valley in order to support start-ups that it considers strategically significant. n68</p><p>* In addition, Zhou Hongyi, Qihoo's CEO and co-founder, serves as an advisor to 11.2 Capital, an early stage venture capital fund that has invested in \"breakthrough\" technologies, such as AI, AR/VR, robotics, and biotechnology, across a range of companies, including Ginkgo Bioworks. n69, n70</p><p>To access talent, a number of leading Chinese tech companies, including Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, and iFlytek, have created or plan to establish one or more centers for research and development in the U.S., n71 just as a number of U.S. companies, including recently Google, have created similar centers in China. nj For U.S. and Chinese companies alike, this access to talent is advantageous to their innovation and competitiveness. When enterprises that have clear or direct links to the Chinese military or defense industry seek to establish such RandD centers or operations in the U.S. or worldwide, then that presence may raise greater concerns. For instance, CETC Software Information Services Co., Ltd. a subsidiary of the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), a state-owned defense conglomerate, reportedly established an innovation center in Silicon Valley in 2014, nk, n72 which seeks to take advantage of that ecosystem with a focus on big data and other advanced information technologies. n73</p><p>Beyond investments, China's presence in U.S. innovation ecosystems extends to include incubators and accelerators, of which there are at least eleven in total in Silicon Valley, that may enable more direct access to talent and technology than investment alone would typically provide. n74 For this reason, the risk and impact of these institutions, which may also often benefit U.S. start-ups through providing them support and access to China's market, merit further scrutiny. nl Since their establishment is typically motivated by and characterized in terms of the benefits of access to U.S. talent, research, and technologies, these activities should be viewed in the broader context of Chinese efforts to leverage tech transfer though legal means that may, in some cases, prove problematic nonetheless to advance indigenous innovation.</p><p>* The ZGC Innovation Center in Silicon Valley was established in May 2016 as an incubator by Zhongguancun (ZGC) Capital. n75, n76</p><p>* It has invested in major funds in Silicon Valley, such as Danhua (see above), Plug and Play, and KiloAngel, nm while also leveraging an incubator that supports early-state U.S. start-ups, including through providing office space, financing, and business development.</p><p>* According to its website, to incubate and 'accelerate' start-ups, it also helps facilitate these start-ups' pursuit of opportunities cooperation, mergers and acquisitions, etc. with major Chinese companies and arranges for them to go to China on field trips and roadshows. n77</p><p>* The Hangzhou Silicon Valley Incubator established in 2014 with support from the government of Hangzhou, n78 had, as of fall 2017, reportedly attracted 47 'overseas high-tech enterprises' to settle in Hangzhou. n79</p><p>* The projects that it has incubated have included companies in big data, cloud computing, and biotechnology, and the objective is to build a \"bridge\" for tech and talents to return to Hangzhou. n80</p><p>* Lab36, an incubator founded in October 2014 and supported by Qihoo 360, has focused on the development of intelligent hardware, providing seed investment and partnerships to start-ups. n81</p><p>Such activities extend well beyond Silicon Valley to other dynamic American innovation ecosystems, including to Boston's biotech sector, nn which has attracted a number of Chinese biotech and pharmaceutical companies to establish RandD operations and incubators to access local talent. n82 In the Boston area, several incubators that involve partnership between the Chinese and the Massachusetts government may positively contribute to competitiveness but should also recognized as linked to China's strategic approach focused on the 'bringing in' of innovation resources back to China's domestic innovation ecosystems, many of which aspire to become \"China's Silicon Valley.\"</p><p>* The China-US Boston Innovation Center (CUBIC), founded in February 2015 with the backing of China's Ministry of Science and Technology, is located on the campus of MIT in the Boston Cambridge Innovation Center. n83 CUBIC is intended to become a platform for collaboration, including for mergers and acquisitions, between the U.S. and China. n84</p><p>* It focuses on helping U.S. enterprises enter the China market, including facilitating access to government resources, with the aim of seeking out top talent and technologies. n85</p><p>* CUBIC and its Miti Venture announced, with Chinese government officials in attendance, a strategic partnership that involved two new funds to incubate \"outstanding overseas entrepreneurial teams.\" n86</p><p>* The Shanghai Zhangjiang Boston Enterprise Park was established in Marlborough, Massachusetts in February 2016, with support from the state government, under the guidance of the Shanghai government, with plans to construct innovation centers focused on biomedical technology, artificial intelligence, and semiconductor integrated circuitry, among others. n87, n88</p><p>* At the time, the president of China's National Eastern Tech Transfer Center highlighted this as an important \"icebreaker,\" as the first case of U.S.-China cooperation in building a high-tech park, in ways that can help Shanghai to emerge as a global tech transfer hub. n89</p><p>* Zhongguancun launched the ZGC Boston Innovation Center as of April 2018, with Beijing government officials in attendance, and its establishment was characterized as important to \"build the ecosystem of Zhongguancun's overseas collaborative innovation resources.\" n90</p><p>The potential benefits and negative externalities of these engagements via venture capital and incubation should receive further consideration going forward, given the clear linkages to government priorities and initiatives to advance Chinese indigenous innovation. Even when there is not evidence that a particular mechanism has been exploited thus far for tech transfer in ways that are illegal or obviously concerning, the access to and knowledge of prioritized technologies can still be beneficial to future targeting and acquisitions. Potentially, as Chinese investments are subjected to greater scrutiny, the focus of tactics for tech transfer could shift further towards these alternative techniques for access to tech and talent resources via accelerators and innovation centers. Again, the factor that should raise questions and differentiate these from purely commercial activities is the consistent government involvement in guidance and direction.</p><p>Looking to the most direct type of tech transfer, selected examples of targeted acquisitions illustrate how buyers that have may links to the Chinese government or appear to act in furtherance of its priorities have targeted U.S. and global companies and their technologies, in furtherance of state priorities. When attempts at acquisitions in the U.S. are blocked, this targeting can shift to look for comparable companies and technologies outside of the U.S., often in countries where scrutiny and review mechanisms are less rigorous, which highlights the importance of a global approach to these challenges, in close coordination with U.S. allies and partners.</p><p>After several failed Chinese attempts at acquisitions in the semiconductor industry, Atop Tech, known for a cutting-edge automated designer capable of producing high-end microchips, was acquired in bankruptcy proceedings in the summer of 2017 by Avatar Integrated Systems, for which the board chairman is a prominent Chinese steel magnate, without any scrutiny from CFIUS. n91</p><p>Complete Genomics was acquired in March 2013 by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), which has links to and has received support from the Chinese government, n92 to support its attempts to create a next-generation sequencer. n93</p><p>As China aims to emerge as a leader in industrial robotics, a priority in \"Made in China 2025,\" there have been a number of acquisitions of robotics companies in the U.S. and worldwide, which include, but are not limited to: n94</p><p>* Paslin, an industrial robot integrator based in the U.S., acquired by Zhejiang Wanfeng Technology in April 2016; n95</p><p>* Midea Group's acquisitions of Kuka, based in Germany, in January 2017, and Servotronix, an Israeli motion control and automation company, in February 2017; n96 and</p><p>* HTI Cybernetics, an industrial robotics integrator based in Michigan, acquired by Chongqing Nanshang Investment group, in October 2017.</p><p>Targeting and Leveraging Universities:</p><p>U.S. and international universities have been a major target of Chinese cyber and, in some cases, human espionage. In the past few years, there have been a number of intrusions targeting universities that engage in sensitive or military research, including Penn State and the University of Virginia. n97, n98 Chinese hackers have continued to target universities, which tend to be tempting as easy targets, including because of limited attention to cyber security, as well as the potential availability of ample IP and data. no, n99 In some cases, students and researchers have leveraged academic research environments in ways that may contravene U.S. law or academic norms. The potential for negative externalities has been clearly illustrated by the case of Liu Ruopeng, np a Duke PhD student, who allegedly appropriated sensitive research funded by the U.S. military on metamaterials, n100 and then returned to China to fund a highly successful research institute, the Kuang-Chi Group, which supports the Chinese military in advanced technological developments. n101 In a more typical occurrence, Chinese students and researchers with experience in top U.S. universities are often targeted for recruitment through Chinese state talent plans and by Chinese companies. n102 Although the openness of university environments is integral to the greatness of the U.S. education systems, the potential for risk highlights the importance of further engagement with academia in order to raise awareness and enhance appropriate safeguards and precautions. n103</p><p>Although there are compelling reasons to welcome Chinese students to the U.S. -- and to encourage them to stay and contribute to American innovation -- it is clear that there are instances when the U.S. education system has been exploited in ways that are problematic at best or, at worst, even contribute to Chinese military modernization. These incidents are not reasons to direct suspicion towards or shut the door on Chinese students and scientists, n104 and a case-by-case response to these incidents is the best way forward. However, when students from PLA universities or Chinese universities that are closely linked to Chinese defense technological development study and pursue research in the U.S., there is a more definite rationale for stronger screening mechanisms to limit access to those with such direct linkages to Chinese military research. Notably, the PLA's National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), has been quite active in sending doctoral students, and also undergraduates, overseas, including to the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, among others. n105</p><p>* As of the fall of 2017, there were at least two NUDT PhD students studying at U.S. universities, one of whose research focused on big data. n106</p><p>* At NUDT's Center for Interdisciplinary Quantum Information Science one prominent researcher returned to \"devote all his energy to the military,\" n107 after pursuing post-doctoral research at Stanford University. n108</p><p>* A researcher with the PLA's NUDT was recently a visiting scientist at a U.S. national laboratory, where his research focused on optics and metrology. n109</p><p>Pursuant to China's Thousand Talents Plan, launched in 2008, n110 over 7,000 scientists and researchers are estimated to have been attracted back to China, receiving substantial financial incentives, nq on a permanent or temporary basis, as of January 2018. n111 Similarly, the Thousand Youth Talents Plan concentrates on the recruitment of younger scientists. While examples of such targeted recruitment of talent through these plans and otherwise abound, certain instances, by way of illustration, raise questions about the possibilities for tech transfer in sensitive and strategic technologies. In particular, certain U.S. scientists have been recruited to take appointments at Chinese universities and to contribute as co-investigators of Chinese laboratories that are linked to dual-use technological development.</p><p>* A leading expert on quantum physics and materials, such as topological insulators, from a prominent U.S. university was recruited through the Thousand Talents Plan to become a professor and the co-investigator of a laboratory at Tsinghua University, and later awarded the People's Republic of China International Science and Technology Cooperation Award. n112</p><p>* A professor at a public research university who had received U.S. military funding for research on bionic robotics later became a co-investigator of a key laboratory supported by the Shenzhen municipal government and also apparently co-founded a company based on that research. n113</p><p>Chinese funding for research at U.S. universities also raises questions about potential externalities and should receive further scrutiny going forward. For instance, Huawei has actively funded research worldwide and pursued academic partnerships through its Huawei Innovation Research Program. n114 In the U.S., Huawei has invested about $10 million each year in research, including on 5G development, collaborating with at least fifty universities that include Harvard University, Stanford University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). n115 In 2017, Huawei devoted $1 million to funding research on AI at the University of California, Berkeley. n116 Although many universities may welcome this source of funding, at a time when U.S. government expenditures on basic research have been declining, there is a need for greater transparency about ways in which that funding may enable access to sensitive data and research, as well as the end uses of IP generated through these research collaborations.</p><p>Some U.S. universities have created joint laboratories with Chinese universities or laboratories that have clear links to military research or support state priorities.</p><p>* The Tsinghua-Michigan Joint Center for Quantum Information (JCQI) seeks to leverage the respective advantages of Tsinghua and the University of Michigan in quantum information in order to establish a \"first-class platform and center for talent cultivation\" in quantum information, while also \"promot[ing] China's research in quantum information to the world-leading level.\" n117</p><p>In this context, it's worth noting that Tsinghua is also involved in the development of quantum technologies for national defense applications, in partnership with China's National University of Defense Technology. n118</p><p>* In June 2017, MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) announced a new five-year collaboration with iFlytek, a Chinese national champion known for its leadership in smart voice technologies, including making 'China's Siri.' n119 Their researchers will collaborate on projects, including computer vision, speech-to-text systems, and human-computer interaction. n120</p><p>* iFlytek's technologies have been leveraged by China's Ministry of Public Security to enable voice biometric collection, providing capabilities threaten privacy and that have the potential for abuse. n121 The company has not yet responded to concerns and questions raised by Human Rights Watch on that point. n122</p><p>* In September 2017, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and LAB Venture signed an agreement to establish the Chengdu Institute of Carnegie Mellon University (CICMU) in the Chengdu Hi-tech Zone, where it will serve as \"a global platform of technology transfer.\"</p><p>* CMU will provide funding, management, expertise, and human resources for the institute, which will focus on AI and smart infrastructure. n123</p><p>Research Collaborations and Commercial Partnerships:</p><p>U.S. companies that engage in joint ventures and partnerships in China can face risks to their technologies in some cases or have become involved in potentially problematic engagements with counterparts that have linkages to the military in other instances. nr' n124</p><p>* In June 2015, NVIDIA established a strategic partnership with Sugon, an enterprise established under China's 863 Plan, and the CAS Institute of Computing Technologies, focusing on deep learning, which involved creation of joint laboratories and release of deep learning projects. ns, n125, n126</p><p>Although this ongoing partnership has primarily focused on commercial applications of deep learning, such as to biomedical data, n127 it is worth noting that Sugon has also been involved in the development of military applications of AI, including in command and control, supporting military-civil fusion. n128, n129, n130, n131</p><p>* Google's China AI Center, announced in December 2017, n132 has started to pursue engagement with several Chinese universities. In particular, Tsinghua's new Institute for Artificial Intelligence plans to pursue cooperation with Google, n133 at a time when the university is also deeply and institutionally committed to China's national strategy of military-civil fusion in AI, n134 including with a high-end laboratory for military intelligence and research funded by the PLA's Central Military Commission. n135</p><p>Such partnerships and research engagements require careful structuring and implementation to mitigate risks of tech transfer or unintended externalities.</p><p>Policy Considerations and Recommendations</p><p>The United States has benefited tremendously from the openness and inclusivity of our innovation ecosystem, but it is vital to balance that openness with recognition of the risks and benefits inherent in engagement and 'entanglement' with China. Our policy responses to these issues should thus be highly nuanced and targeted in order to mitigate the risks of collateral damage to our own competitiveness. Given the global nature of these issues, the U.S. must also engage and coordinate with allies and partners in undertaking appropriate countermeasures, which include stricter reviews of acquisitions, investments, and certain collaborations.</p><p>Looking forward, the U.S. must not only defend its research and technologies but also go on the offensive, not fearing competition with China, but rather embracing it. That is, the U.S. must recognize and reinforce its own enduring advantages in innovation through the pursuit of policies that have enabled and can revitalize its own innovation ecosystem. These include a focus on STEM education at all levels, robust and sustained investments in basic research, and openness to welcome talented scientists and entrepreneurs, including from China. In the today's strategic competition for technological dominance, the U.S. can win only by sprinting ahead, not just building walls.</p><p>U.S. policymakers should consider a range of policy responses, which might include, but not be limited to, the following recommendations:</p><p>Targeted Countermeasures:</p><p>* Explore updates and revisions to national export controls, defense trade controls and investment review mechanisms that take into account the unique challenges of dual-use commercial technologies. nt, n136</p><p>* Share lessons learned and pursue coordination with allies and partners to account for the global scope and scale of these dynamics.</p><p>* Engage in outreach to companies and universities in order to highlight the potential for risk or unintended externalities in joint ventures and partnerships, including through developing and presenting a series of case studies based on past incidents.</p><p>* Consider reestablishing the now-disbanded FBI National Security Higher Education Advisory Board to facilitate and institutionalize such engagements. nu, n137, n138</p><p>* Enhance and enforce cyber security standards and requirements for contractors and laboratories engaged in sensitive academic research.</p><p>* Review recent and existing research and commercial partnerships on strategic technologies that involve support and funding from foreign militaries, governments or state-owned/supported enterprises, evaluating the dual-use risks and potential externalities in each case.</p><p>* Ensure that these appropriate safeguards are applied to sensitive datasets associated with AI development, including data used for training purposes.</p><p>* Consider introducing, or where appropriate adjusting, policies or guidelines restricting those who have received from the U.S. military or government at a certain level from also accepting funding from or collaborating with a foreign military, state-owned enterprise, or 'national champion' that is not an ally.</p><p>* Enhance counterintelligence capabilities, particularly by augmenting language and technical expertise, to focus on enforcement. nv, n139</p><p>* Improve visa screening of foreign nationals who plan to study or research sensitive or strategic technologies, targeting scrutiny on the basis of whether or not students or researchers have direct and clear connections to foreign militaries, governments or intelligence services.</p><p>* Incorporate an independent review mechanism into the process to assess evidentiary standards and mitigate risks of bias in such visa determinations.</p><p>* Identify organizations engaging in talent recruitment that are linked to the Chinese central and local governments or to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and require their registration as foreign agents, where appropriate. nw</p><p>Ensuring American Competitiveness:</p><p>* Increase and commit to sustaining funding for basic research and the long-term development of strategic technologies.</p><p>* Prioritize improving the accessibility and affordability of STEM education at all levels, including creating new scholarships to support those studying computer science, artificial intelligence, and quantum information science, among other priority disciplines.</p><p>* Sustain openness to immigration, welcoming graduating students and talented researchers, while potentially offering a fast-track option to citizenship.</p><p>* Explore the expansion of alliance coordination and cooperation in innovation, including deeper collaboration in research, development, and experimentation with new technologies and their applications.</p><p>na These include: aero-engines and gas turbines, deep-space and deep-sea exploration, quantum communications and computing, brain-science and brain-inspired research, national cyberspace security, integrated space-to-earth information networks, big data, smart manufacturing and robotics, and new key materials development. In addition, artificial intelligence was added as another megaproject as of July 2017.</p><p>nb China's funding for RandD in basic sciences doubled in the past five years, from 41.2 billion RMB (about $6.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 2011 to 82.3 billion RMB (about $12.25 billion) in 2016, according to China's Ministry of Science and Technology.</p><p>nc At the same time, it is important to recognize that China is not \"winning\" in AI per se, and the frequent characterization of advances in these technologies as a race is not particularly accurate or constructive at this point.</p><p>nd Despite frequent claims to the contrary, the Chinese government has not committed to spending $150 billion on AI. It is difficult to come up with a precise estimate of current levels of funding, across both central and local governments, which would include a number of guidance funds, science and technology plans, and institutions like the National Natural Science Foundation of China.</p><p>ne Please note that I do not think that \"arms race\" is an apt framing for U.S.-China military and strategic competition in AI for a variety of reasons, including that \"AI\" is not a weapon but rather a diverse range of technologies for which development is driven predominantly by commercial enterprises.</p><p>nf It is worth noting that estimates of AI talent vary greatly across different measurements, depending on the methodology used to count, the requirements for who is counted, etc.</p><p>ng Although news reports misreported this as $10 billion at the time (and continue to do so), there is no evidence in the available sources that there are plans to spend that much on this particular laboratory at this time, though total levels of funding may very well amount to tens of billions in total in the years to come. For instance, In addition, the new Anhui Quantum Science Industry Development Fund, created in December 2017, also plans to devote 10 billion RMB (nearly $1.6 billion) in funding to quantum computing, communications, and metrology.</p><p>nh China's level of advancement in science and technology is highly varied across and even within domains. For instance, China may lead in certain AI techniques and applications, such as facial recognition in particular, but is not yet considered a clear leader in all aspects of the discipline.</p><p>ni Danhua Capital's full name is the \"Zhongguancun-Stanford Emerging Technologies Venture Capital Fund\"</p><p>nj For this reason, I would discourage considering policy options that restrict these commercial activities, lest U.S. companies become constrained in their own overseas RandD activities.</p><p>nk Please note that I have not been able to find detailed accounts of its activities in Silicon Valley based on an initial search, which could imply that its presence and activities are fairly limited at present.</p><p>nl To clarify, I mention these centers and incubators only as examples of activities that may merit further consideration in the context of current debates over risks of tech transfers, not to imply that there is any direct evidence that I have seen so far of wrongdoing. I caveat my concerns based on the fact that my research is limited to open sources available online, and I have not had the opportunity to visit or engage directly with these institutions. Moreover, since their establishment is relatively recent, it is likely that their impact has been fairly limited to date, though that may change as this focus on incubators, overseas innovation centers, etc. expands.</p><p>nm In addition, its 'cooperative institutions' include Peakview Capital, C.M. Capital Foundation, Danhua Capital, and AngelList.</p><p>nn The question of Chinese investments in Boston's biotech sector was not a topic that I had a chance to explore at length within the framework of this testimony but should receive further attention.</p><p>no For instance, just this month, reports emerged that Chinese hackers have infiltrated Australian National University, potentially compromising the university's research and intellectual property.</p><p>nP Please note that I consider this case to be an extreme example. It is difficult to estimate how many such incidents have occurred in the past few years.</p><p>nq Typically, successful applicants receive a bonus of 1 million RMB ($151,000) to start, and then can apply research funding of 3--5 million RMB (about $450,000 to $740,000. Those foreign scientists who are recruited receive further incentives, such as subsidies for accommodations.</p><p>nr Since this issue has received greater concern and attention in the past, I limit this discussion to highlighting a few recent cases of partnerships in emerging technologies in particular.</p><p>ns Of note, in April 2015, the U.S. government had banned NVIDIA and Intel from selling GPUs to China's four supercomputer centers. However, this ban does not appear to have curtailed NVIDIA's partnership with Sugon, which has continued.</p><p>nt Of note, a case that illustrates these dynamics is Aqueti, a company founded by Duke University scientists who developed a sophisticated gigapixel camera that was originally intended to provide long-range surveillance for the U.S. Navy, with support and funding from the Pentagon. After the founder later struggled to raise money in the U.S., he relocated the company to China, where it has since found a sizable market for use with Chinese police.</p><p>nu Rush Doshi is to be credited for initially bringing this board to my attention. Please see the citation for his perspective on these issues.</p><p>nv For a recent example of successful apprehension and enforcement, see the arrest at the airport of a former Apple employee who had downloaded a plan for a self-driving car circuit board and then booked a flight to China, where he planned to work for and transfer the design to a Chinese self-driving car start-up.</p><p>nw I have argued and want to emphasize again that I do not believe that scrutiny or restrictions should be imposed against Chinese students and researchers on the basis of national origin alone. When state-driven recruitment, such as through China's talent plans, that is targeted against persons who are of Chinese heritage and/or Chinese citizens is deemed problematic, then the response should be directed against the organizations in question, not the individuals who are being targeted.</p><p>n1 For the authoritative perspective on these issues, please see: William C.

Introduction</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Chabot, and Members of the Committee:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am Allyson Cavaretta, a resident of Maine, a University of Notre Dame graduate from the Mendoza College of Business, Marketing Management, cum laude, three generations in small business and a principal at my family business of over 35 years, the Meadowmere Resort in OgunquitMaine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today about why Congress should look closely at the impact of Big Tech on Small Business. I will be speaking to the effects of recent actions by Google in the travel landscape. However, please know that I do not stand alone. Many of my concerns translate across the Small Business ecosystem as can be seen in supporting documentation. n1 As recently as November 6th, the multibillion dollar company Expedia expressed concerns about a level playing field with Google n2. On just November 8th Bloomberg described Google Search Ads behavior as \"crushing\" and \"wiping out wiping out a combined market value of more than $13 billion from the three online travel agents\" n3. When these large companies are impacted by billions in just six months, there is all the more urgency to consider the impact on small businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">II. Testimony Summary</p><p>I am here today for three reasons: to explain why Google's most recent actions in the online travel ecosystem present a serious threat to small business; to explain how those behaviors in turn harm the end consumer; and to urge that Congress address immediately Google's near monopoly access to market for small business.</p><p>To echo the testimony of Dr. Robert Epstein before the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution from Tuesday, June 16, 2019: The problem with Google is that it has the power to determine what content a person will or will not see. No single entity - especially a private company that is not accountable to the public -should have such power. n4</p><p>III. Google's Actions in the Travel Space - Impact on Access There is a history to the detrimental actions of Google for independent lodging properties in the online travel ecosystem. In 2015, suddenly and without warning, changes made by Google to their search algorithm for hotels altered the lodging results pages. Under that change, Google would allow for the consumer to go to the hotel's website by clicking on a link, but when one searched for a specific hotel, the results would return one of two options:</p><p>* A singular 'Book Here' box that went directly to an Online Travel Agent if the hotel had a relationship with such an agency. This option was financially beneficial to Google who would be paid a per click fee by the Online Travel Agent.</p><p>* A 'No known availability for this property' message, which for the common person meant 'This hotel has no rooms'. This option had the net effect of closing off hotels that could not 'pay to play' with Online Travel Agents.</p><p>This concern was pervasive across the Google platforms: desktop, mobile and the app. The late Spring timing was particularly concerning as the change occurred as peak season in Maine was getting underway and would quickly impact the profitability of independent hotels, with little to no recourse. The hotel industry is not based on making it up tomorrow, but rather one that has a perishable amount of time to book and deliver rooms, to seat and serve meals - Then it is lost forever. Not just to the hotel, but to the employee's paycheck and the state's tax revenue.</p><p>After approximately one month of strong urging by Congressional representation from our state, Google made an adjustment that clarified to the user to visit the property's website. Visually, that looked as follows:</p><p>However, this icon did not link to the website. The consumer would have to go find the website; one could not click or call directly from the icon shown here. Occasionally, the 'No known availability for this property' continued to appear but would retreat with subsequent outreach from Congress. Monitoring Google is an ongoing challenge and as recently as October 29, 2019, the company's algorithm and changes to it were cited by the Wall Street Journal as \"secretive\" n5.</p><p>There are concerns beyond secretive algorithm changes that speak to an unequal playing field for small businesses in the travel space that exist at the time of this testimony. Examples that support an unfair playing field include:</p><p>* Hoteliers are prohibited from the 'Posts' feature, which is given to vacation rentals, doctors and lawyers in their search results. This prevents hotels from being able to offer the option to book direct or learn about specials in their listings. n6</p><p>* Hoteliers are prohibited from the 'View Rooms' feature under their Google My Business listing, which is given to the Online Travel Agents known as Travelocity and Orbitz (both owned and operated by Expedia). n7</p><p>Though I appreciate Google's testimony that they are proud to work with hundreds of thousands of small and medium size businesses, enabling these businesses to tap into the commercial opportunity of the Internet n8, that claim is not uniform for all types of small businesses in the search landscape.</p><p>I would point this Committee to the most recent unexpected Google algorithm change called the 'March 2019 core update'. With this update, Google has decided to become heavily involved the travel space and once again alter control over access to hotels such as ours by changing how the platform's search interface works, especially the components known as the '4 pack' n9 and the metasearch ad console. The changes from this most recent iteration once again began to take effect just as Maine entered its busy summer season in late spring 2019 and became apparent by July to ourselves and industry experts.</p><p>With the 'March 2019 core update', the direct booking engine efforts of a hotel are pushed to 'below the fold' and instead replaced by paid metasearch results that Google benefits from financially. The impact of this change means that Google is prioritizing the area where it makes money from the impressions and clicks within the metasearch box over the direct booking engine of the hotel. The result often misleads the consumer to the highest bidder, such as an online travel agent or fraudulent website, instead of to the hotel. The financial resources to compete against the billions of dollars that online travel companies such as Expedia and Booking.com have in order to appear in the metasearch box are simply not afforded to the many small businesses that make up Maine's tourism industry and beyond. In my opinion, this is far removed from an open marketplace for a small business in Maine or in any state.</p><p>The following are screen shots of the changes that are of concern to my business and are of concern to my business and to small businesses in the travel ecosystem n10:</p><p>It has come to the attention of the hotel industry - and therefore our attention - that Google is using its platform to place its paid product between the traveler and the hotelier. In essence, Google's layout acts as a gatekeeper that the hotel must pay in order for its direct booking option to appear. I will note to this Committee that our hotel's correspondence to the Maine delegation on the matter of the 'March 2019 core update' n11 is dated just one day after Google claimed to not engage in such practices at the United States House Judiciary Committee hearing. n12</p><p>In my personal opinion, should a large company with such tremendous market share as Google look to undercut access by having its paid products 'bump out' a direct booking option, there are a number of anti-trust and anti-competitive concerns raised.</p><p>In fact, industry experts noted a milestone in Google's dominance in controlling search behaviors in June 2019 when, for the first time, a majority of all browser-based searches on Google.com resulted in zero-clicks. n13 Google sends a huge portion of search clicks to their own properties such as YouTube, Maps, Android, Google's blog, subdomains of Google.com, and a dozen or so others. Over 93% of searches began on Google before this aggressive change n14:</p><p>When one considers that 82% of travel bookings in 2018 were completed via a website or mobile app without any human interaction in combination with Google's dominant market share of search, n15 the small businesses and innkeepers of Maine and innkeepers in the United States are right to be concerned. The dominant market share of Google, as seen in the graph above at 93%, lends itself to rent-seeking behaviors that prevent market access and to an unfair playing field. In my personal opinion, there is good reason for the Small Business Committee and Congress to be very concerned. n16</p><p>IV. Google's Actions in the Travel Space - Impact on Meadowmere Resort The mechanism by which Google looks to control access is entitled 'Google My Business listing', commonly referred to as the 'GMB'. This feature appeared in 2014 and has steadily become a middleman between a small business and the consumer. The GMB and the accompanying search results change depending on the search terms and consumer device.</p><p>To display the visual nature of this, I am including a screen shot of a search for 'meadowmere main' showing the organic search results on the left hand side and the GMB on the right hand side:</p><p>To highlight the impact that Google's behavior with the GMB has had, I have prepared data from our Google analytics for the Meadowmere Resort. However, one must understand that a small business is limited as to what historic data Google provides to us when it comes to GMB listing insights. In other words, a small business must trust that Google is providing accurate reporting on its own advertising products. Despite this caveat, the data is compelling.</p><p>When comparing May 1,2019 through September 30, 2019 against May 1,2018 through September 30, 2018, the following changes are observed in the GMB listing for our hotel n17 :</p><p>* Phone Call Actions: Number of times customers have called the business from the GMB listing</p><p>5/1/18 to 9/30/18: 1,894</p><p>5/1/19 to 9/30/19: 2,324</p><p>Increase of 22.7%</p><p>Why this matters: Consumers being shifted from our hotel's website to Google's GMB product to access the phone number, if that consumer is even able to find our phone number.</p><p>* Website Actions: Number of times customers have visited the website from the GMB listing</p><p>5/1/18 to 9/30/18: 16,253</p><p>5/1/19 to 9/30/19: 17,066</p><p>Increase of 5%</p><p>Why this matters: Consumers being shifted from the organic and free search results to Google's GMB product to access our website.</p><p>* Total Searches: Number of times customers found the GMB listing by searching on Google Search or Maps</p><p>5/1/18 to 9/30/18: 326,787</p><p>5/1/19 to 9/30/19: 447,335</p><p>Increase of 36%</p><p>Why this matters: Consumers being shifted from clicking organic (free) search results to access the information on our website to viewing Google's GMB product for the same information, regardless of desktop, mobile or in app searches.</p><p>When one looks at Total Searches and Website Actions, one is able to calculate a rough click-through rate of 3.8% for our GMB listing. If such a click-through rate occurred for an online display ad unit, our hotel would be experiencing an outstanding result since across all industries, the average click-through rate for a search ad is 1.91 %. n18</p><p>When comparing room nights reserved through the direct phone channel for May through September across the 6 year history of the GMB, the following is observed for our hotel:</p><p>Since the 'March 2019 core update' a 33% decrease year over year from 2018 to 2019 has occurred in room nights reserved by direct phone call at our hotel.</p><p>With the GMB listing experiencing a staggering year over year growth since the 'March 2019 core update', the GMB click-through rate and corresponding change in our direct phone channel raises concerns that organic search and even some ads have been deprioritized by Google. One cannot help but wonder if Google is able to push the performance of a GMB to these outstanding levels by funneling searches to its own paid product.</p><p>The transparency into such behavior remains opaque at best. Our hotel deploys landing pages and Urchin Tracking Module parameters, commonly called UTM codes, to measure sources to our website and evaluate marketing efforts. An example of UTM tracking can be seen within our GMB listing under the hotel 'info' area:</p><p>While Google offers the opportunity for our small business to enter such a link and therefore receive some clarity within Google Analytics on just how much traffic is sourcing from our GMB listing, there have been multiple instances whereby Google arbitrarily removes the UTM code without warning. Without this UTM code, a small business lacks this ability to accurately track the performance of their GMB as the data hides within organic search results.</p><p>However, knowing that the UTM code is subject to random removal, our hotel proceeded to screen shot capture the impact of the GMB when separated from the organic traffic and present what just seven days of actively tracking represents. Prior to separation, the organic traffic to our website showed approximately 200 user sessions per day. After implementing the UTM tracking code on our GMB listing, the GMB listing experiences approximately 75 user sessions per day - or 37.5% of the user session traffic. No other changes were made to ad campaigns or tracking during this period in order to provide a clean capture of the GMB impact. I would add that in preparation for today, over 100 other innkeepers indicated that they too have these similar concerns with their organic traffic versus the GMB traffic.</p><p>GMB listing as tracked via UTM coding, October 15, 2019 through October 21, 2019:</p><p>Google Organic Search performance, October 15, 2019 through October 21, 2019:</p><p>I would note to this Committee that not only does a small business contend with the difficulties in retaining the UTM tracking in a GMB listing, but our small business also receives controlled and limited data access thru the GMB listing management area. I would highlight that the listing management reporting that Google provides is not the same as Google Analytics. In fact, without the UTM code, GMB data is in an entirely separate console and allows for only three data sets that provide only 18 months of historical access despite GMB listing being in place since 2014.</p><p>These data sets are Discover Insights, Photos and Phone Calls:</p><p>When the UTM tracking is removed, these data sets are the only means by which a small business can analyze the performance of the GMB listing.</p><p>* In regards to the Discover Insights, this area is in stark contrast to the Google Analytics dashboard that provides extensive website metrics. One cannot help but wonder why Google would not subject its GMB product to the same metrics capabilities that other ad products and traffic sources are scrutinized by. One can only see such metric if the UTM code is in place and remains as such.</p><p>* In regards to the Photos Insights, the number of views of photos on the GMB listing for our hotel reached 26,658 in the seven days period of the UTM code activation. To put this volume of views into perspective, from the period of October 15th through October 21st, the page views across the entire website for our hotel were 15,490. With the introduction of Google Local Guides, an unpaid, points based incentive program for people to submit photos and reviews, Google is building a database of image files globally at the local level. n19 One should note that this is in combination with GMB listing feature entitled 'Website' that Google offers to create a dedicated website within the GMB for a business. This 'Website' feature focuses on offering quotes and photos and is Google branded. n20 It is not entirely clear what, if any, requirement Google may make upon a small business to use this Google website product.</p><p>* In regards to the Phone Calls Insights, while our hotel has seen a decrease in overall phone calls, calls originating from our GMB listing have grown 22.7% year over year in a five month period of May 1st through September 30th. This is an increase of 430 (+22.7%) calls on top of the 1,894 calls that were initiated from the GMB listing in this same five month period in 2018. This is significant because while call volume is down, Google is still reporting growth. The 'March 2019 core update' and its corresponding changes on the GMB have a multiplier effect in that it is both decreasing our call load by serving information directly through Google's products and it is consuming the remaining call traffic at an increasing rate through the GMB listing. With the 2018 average phone reservation revenue of $341, this represents a year over year shift in a revenue of over $140,000 now dependent on Google's GMB listing performance.</p><p>Given that the changes noted here are occurring within the short five month period that the 'March 2019 core update' has affected the travel landscape, this Committee should also make note of the speed at which Google is impacting the ability for a small business to access the consumer and vice versa -for a consumer to access a small business. This impact is reflected in the rapid increase in spend required across Google's pay to play products of Hotel Ads, Video Display Ads, Text Display Ads, Adwords Pay-Per-Click and Retargeting/Remarketing to protect direct bookings to our own hotel. For our hotel that means an increased spend of over 500% from 2016 to 2019 with Google, who has gone from 3% to 13% of our annual marketing budget. A small business such as ours has experienced a 20% increase in our overall marketing budget in an effort to keep up with Google's changes to direct bookings. I would note that increase does not include the fees to connect an internet booking engine to Google or the fees paid to online travel agents who often outspend our hotel in this pay-to-play model.</p><p>I would caution that the market access concerns will only grow as screens get smaller with mobile bookings and perhaps, the need for a screen disappears altogether with voice search. In my personal opinion, the small business and the consumer will then be at the mercy of what Google decides to show - or tell.</p><p>V. Google's Actions in the Travel Space - Impact on Independent Innkeepers To assuage concerns that our hotel may be an isolated incident, the Association of Independent Hospitality Professionals (AIHP) and the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII) provided the data presented in this section. AIHP represents independent lodging across the United States. PAII represents innkeepers, bed and breakfast, boutique hotels, and other lodging professionals both nationally and internationally. The Meadowmere Resort is not a member of either association and therefore the data presented on our hotel stands separate from the information provided by members of these groups.</p><p>Over 900 innkeepers representing over 47 states and the District of Columbia supported OH the points made by our business here today n21 :</p><p>STATE..........Innkeepers reported as impacted by Google</p><p>AK..............19</p><p>AL.............. 5</p><p>AR..............15</p><p>AZ..............10</p><p>CA..............39</p><p>CO..............20</p><p>CT.............. 6</p><p>DE.............. 3</p><p>FL..............21</p><p>GA..............11</p><p>HI.............. 1</p><p>IA.............. 9</p><p>ID.............. 2</p><p>IL..............23</p><p>IN.............. 7</p><p>KS.............. 0</p><p>KY..............10</p><p>STATE..........Innkeepers reported as impacted by Google</p><p>LA..............21</p><p>MA..............30</p><p>MD..............20</p><p>ME..............59</p><p>MI..............72</p><p>MN..............22</p><p>MO..............28</p><p>MS.............. 2</p><p>MT.............. 1</p><p>NC..............36</p><p>ND.............. 0</p><p>NE.............. 3</p><p>NH..............16</p><p>NJ..............12</p><p>NM.............. 7</p><p>NV.............. 0</p><p>NY..............65</p><p>OH.............. 9</p><p>OK.............. 6</p><p>OR..............11</p><p>PA..............57</p><p>RI.............. 4</p><p>SC.............. 5</p><p>SD.............. 1</p><p>TN..............19</p><p>TX..............56</p><p>UT.............. 1</p><p>VA..............55</p><p>VT..............24</p><p>WA..............29</p><p>WI..............28</p><p>WV.............. 6</p><p>WY.............. 1</p><p>OTHER LOCATIONS........Innkeepers reported as impacted by Google</p><p>Canada.............. 3</p><p>District of Columbia.......... 4</p><p>Mexico.............. 1</p><p>VI. Google's Actions in the Travel Space - Impact on End Consumer Digital travel sales worldwide increased 10.4% to $694.41 billion in 2018. n22 For states like Maine, tourism is one of Maine's largest and most vibrant industries. Total recent tourism expenditures were over 6 billion dollars a year - which equals $191 per second and tourism employs almost 107,000 people, about 16% of the state's workforce. n23 Ogunquit, a signature destination in Maine and where our hotel is located, contributes over $34 million annually in tax revenue to the state.</p><p>The size of the travel market creates strong incentives for middlemen like Google to insert themselves between a hotel (supplier) and a guest (consumer) with a 'pay to play' model. It is a lucrative ecosystem especially where consumers rely heavily on digital information to plan travel to places that they have not been before.</p><p>For these reasons, in my personal opinion Section 5(a) of the FTC Act which provides that \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce . . . are . . . declared unlawful\" and where \"Deceptive\" practices are defined in the Commission's Policy Statement on Deception as involving a material representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances may be of interest to this Committee. n24 There are two areas which I would call to this Committee's attention to regarding Google's practices: the blue 'Book a Room' button and the ability to find a hotel's direct phone number.</p><p>Google's Blue 'Book a Room' Button</p><p>When over 70% of consumers believe that they are booking directly with a hotel when in fact they are being redirected by Google's blue 'Book a Room' button, the traveling public is being misled. n25 In fact, the petition comments refer to this concern repeatedly. n26 This blue button is a 'pay to play' feature operating on a bid system that is frequently won by the large Online Travel Agencies Expedia and Booking.com and places not one but two middlemen between the consumer and the hotel. A small business is placed at a distinct disadvantage in this arrangement because the 'pay to play' model is pitting the independent hotelier against billion dollar public companies. However, the consumer is also impacted by the model whereby they can no longer alter their reservation without going through the Online Travel Agent and cannot discern that the blue 'Book a Room' button does not lead to the independent hotel directly.</p><p>The insertion of Google as a 'pay to play' middleman introduces additional costs that must impact the economic system. Either small businesses absorb this cost - and thereby decrease margin and reinvestment into their product and community - or they pass along the additional expense of being found on Google to the consumer. This additional expense can range from 18% and more, an unsustainable inflation of pricing to the traveler. n27</p><p>Nowhere does Google educate the general public that Google and their Online Travel Agency (OTA) partners are diverting the consumer's purchase away from the small business that the consumer intended to buy from with the blue 'Book a Room' button. The disturbing side effect of online booking scams is also raised by this lack of end consumer transparency.</p><p>Google's Impact on Finding Phone Numbers</p><p>Before coming to the purchase of a room, the end consumer may have questions that they wish to ask directly of the hotel. Since the 'March 2019 core update', the ability to locate a direct phone number within search queries has become an increasing challenge. While developing our Google Ads strategy for Q4 2019, a performance review of the Dynamic Search Ads (DSAs) on Google that ran over this summer was conducted. This included a list of search terms that Google's algorithm decided to serve our dynamic ads on.</p><p>There was a trend on this specific report that in my personal opinion is worth bringing to this Committee's attention. It appears that our campaign served ads against a number of unique searches for our hotel's phone number. n28 While seeing a few of these phone number searches would be normal, both I and our digital marketing partner consider the number of unique searches over the summer of 2019 and since the 'March 2019 core update' to be abnormal.</p><p>What this told us is that users are having a harder time finding our direct phone number organically in Google search results since the 'March 2019 core update'. Even more disturbing, the report only includes searches that received at least one click in the past 30 days and were used by a significant number of users on Google. This means that there are most-likely other search terms that have been used and are unaccounted for. In response, our hotel enabled Call Extensions in Google Ads for our Q4 campaign. This functionality allows us to add a phone number to our ads. It is important to remember that by doing this we are now effectively paying to improve the discovery of our own phone number with this method. The net effect is that Google has moved the ability to see a direct phone of an independent hotel into the 'pay to play' space.</p><p>However, call extensions do not show with every ad impression served - The secretive Google algorithm determines whether to show the call extension or not, even if the consumer is directly searching for the phone number. With this action, Google's 'pay to play' product stands directly between the information sought by the consumer and the accurate search result that they are looking for.</p><p>VII. Monopoly Power for Access to Search Results is the Modern Railroad A century ago, railroads reduced the time and distance to market for goods and people, radically changing the costs and convenience to travel. Now, a century later, Google and other Big Tech players stand in a similar position. It is now cheaper and more convenient to simply go online and explore all the places one can go.</p><p>However, much as the public and businesses feared the railroads for their monopoly power, small businesses are today acutely aware that it is impossible to do business without Big Tech, especially Google.</p><p>While no one would fault Google for making decisions on innovation based on their bottom line, the net impact to small business and consumers is the consideration that this body holds as its charge. There is great economic and societal danger in Google's ability to decide who succeeds in small business and who fails in our communities and in our country. When something as fundamental as the free circulation of information is in question, the issues are no longer just economic, but also strike at the core of our values.</p><p>Much like the corn farmer that had been limited to no other way to access the market with his perishable goods than the railroad, small businesses are at the end of the line for today's modern equivalent, the Internet. When one entity such as Google holds similar dominance - and perhaps similar lack of transparency into that dominance - our society is faced with the same inefficiencies and costs. In the end the consumer is hurt by a decrease in supply driving an increase in costs and pricing, but more importantly the small business economy that this country thrives on is adversely impacted. I urge this Committee to work diligently on an immediate answer to this modern monopoly and market access problem.</p><p>VIII. Conclusion</p><p>The U.S. Small Business economy has thrived because entrepreneurs know that they can devote years of productive labor and resources into developing their inventions for the marketplace, secure in the knowledge that their work provides a solid foundation for a livelihood and a better community.</p><p>Big Tech looms over small businesses in the travel space and indeed, many commercial activities, threatening supply chain between supply and demand without rhyme or reason. Small businesses and consumer choice depends on access to market in order to thrive. The current structure is incentivizing a form of \"efficient infringement\" by large, capitalized companies, such as Google, who make an economic impact on the fair market value price for travel while not producing the consumed product or paying the producer for access to the product. This is in addition to the lost investment in the small businesses operations. The current structure creates an unvirtuous cycle whereby ever increasing costs to access markets decrease access to supply, drive up costs to consumers and drive down choice, and therefore undermine the foundations of the U.S. Small Business economy.</p><p>In sum, the U.S. Small Business community is now characterized by inordinately high costs to market access, high legal hurdles, and free riding by both the legal and illegal players in the online market.</p><p>I would ask that Congress through the diligent work of this Small Business Committee \"hardwire\" into the online 'railroad' the fundamental checks and balances necessary to ensure that the rights of Small Business owners are recognized and respected. Congress should look to address by regulatory means the necessary and real reform that will bring back balance to the U.S. Small Business economy and return the marketplace to the \"gold standard\" of innovation, market access and a fair playing field by the rule of law.</p><p>I thank you Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Chabot, and Members of the Committee for the opportunity to present this information to you and thank you for listening to the small businesses impacted by the decisions of Big Tech. It is an ever- changing landscape and I appreciate the work of this Committee to vigorously protect small businesses like ours.</p><p>I am happy to answer any questions you may have.</p><p>Acknowledgements</p><p>I wish to acknowledge assistance provided to me in preparing this testimony from Lisa Kolb, Greg Dugal and Devin Temple.

Introduction</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We applaud the House Small Business Committee for holding this hearing on the effect large technology-driven companies have on the growth and success of their small business counterparts. The time is right to examine how public policy concepts, including the role of competition law, apply in a variety of markets characterized by the presence of large companies with global reach. In previous tech sector-focused hearings across Congress, Members heard from a broad swath of large company representatives and consumer interest groups. Even in those hearings, the discussion often turned to how the practices of large companies affect innovative small businesses. ACT | The App Association is the voice of small business tech entrepreneurs, and we appreciate the Committee welcoming the views of our members and for giving small companies a voice on how best to safeguard innovative market activity and job creation in tech-driven industries.</p><p>The App Association is a trade group representing about 5,000 small to mid-sized software and connected device companies across the globe. In the United States, our member companies are part of a $1.7 trillion industry, supporting about 5.9 million jobs. We regularly participate in legal and regulatory proceedings affecting the relationship between consumers, small innovators, and platforms. n1 Further, we actively facilitate engagement between app developers, investors, and platforms in forums across the country. n2 For example, we are hosting events across the nation this year and next in our Developed | The App Economy Tour to highlight local success stories from the app ecosystem. Our destinations include New York, Minneapolis, Denver, and Oakland, and our panelists range from our members to venture capitalists to legal experts discussing subjects like the California Consumer Privacy Act. n3 The constituents of members of this Committee drive competition in the app ecosystem, and with these events, we aim to show that innovation is happening everywhere in the United States.</p><p>We urge this Committee to carefully consider how any potential changes to relevant federal law would affect industries across the economy. There is no longer a \"tech industry\" as it was commonly perceived when personal computers (PCs) first connected to the internet. Ubiquitous connectivity and access to cloud computing superimposed a tech-driven element to virtually all industries across the economy from agriculture to venture capital. As a result, competition has new and dynamic characteristics not just in tech, but everywhere. App Association member companies are at the center of these market changes, and their continued ability to create jobs in your congressional districts depends on robust enforcement of antitrust laws where appropriate and allowing competition to take place where intervention is inappropriate.</p><p>The proliferation and increased diversity of entrepreneurship creates less definable markets where value chains are not as easy to trace since they rely on data rather than tangible goods and are undergirded by two-sided platforms. We call on the Committee to appreciate the complexity of the market while also keeping in mind a few straightforward concepts that define the evolution of platform-driven markets.</p><p>First, app developers have direct relationships with their customers and clients--they are not \"suppliers or manufacturers\" of apps on behalf of software platforms. Second, software platforms provide significant value for developers and consumers, demonstrated by the increase in choices, access to new markets, and the reduction in prices for software since platforms entered the market. Third, platforms are not perfect. Developers want more transparency and continued improvements to security and safety. Our member companies want platforms to compete for their business, and they want to ensure competition is robust.</p><p>II. Software Platforms Provide Autonomy to Developers</p><p>Although platforms help software developers and device makers reach their clients and customers, there is a direct relationship between the client or customer and the developer. The majority decision of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) in Apple v. Pepper--a split 5-4 decision--mistakenly conceives of platforms as \"retailers\" of apps, while app developers are mere \"manufacturers or suppliers.\" n4 But our member companies do not \"manufacture\" or \"supply\" software on behalf of a platform. Platform companies do not order a shipment of apps from a developer as part of their supply chain--app companies are not contract manufacturers. Rather, developers sell directly to consumers and clients.</p><p>In Apple v. Pepper, SCOTUS was grappling with whether an app buyer has standing to sue a platform company under antitrust law, even though the app developer sets the app's price. Important to that determination is whether the buyer is also a direct buyer from the platform, which in turn is in part a function of whether the developer's product is distinct from the platform's product. This line-drawing may seem semantic, but it is an important exercise from a competition perspective. Developers can choose the best platform through which to reach these customers and clients, and platforms compete with each other for the ability to provide that service to our member companies. The result of Apple v. Pepper is legal precedent to now treat app developers as part of a distribution chain controlled by platforms, at least for purposes of whether a platform can be sued for app prices charged by app developers. But the relationships between developers and their customers and clients are direct and separate from the exchange of value for app developer services that comprise the platform-to-business market.</p><p>III. Platforms Have Reduced Costs for Developers and Enhanced Competition and Choices for Consumers</p><p>Consumers and developers experienced significant changes since the introduction of various mobile software platforms. In addition to having more choices, consumers also benefit from lower prices for software and even access to new markets that did not previously exist. Similarly, developers benefit from lower overhead costs, built-in customer trust, and wider distribution and market access.</p><p>Choices proliferated because entry into the software market is much easier now than it was before platforms. n5 Before platforms, the nature of the marketplace forced software developers to take on tasks that were well beyond their core competencies--from marketing to protecting their intellectual property and negotiating with a variety of different types of companies to distribute their products. The transaction costs of taking on all these extra tasks were significant, and platforms have eliminated many of them. The resulting environment is one in which small companies like App Association members can retain their size and thrive. Our member companies experience a wide variety of growth trajectories. Growing to the enormous size and reach of companies like Facebook or Uber is not the only measure of success. To fully appreciate the depth of the app economy and its potential, one must look well beyond the \"Top 10\" apps in the major app stores or the eye-catching headlines covering the initial public offerings of unicorn companies.</p><p>Before the ubiquity of mobile platforms, the software ecosystem ran on personal computers. This forced early app companies, often with teams of just one or two developers, to wear many hats to develop, market, and manage their products. App companies were not only required to write code for their products, but they were also responsible for: 1) managing their public websites, 2) hiring third-parties to handle financial transactions, 3) employing legal teams to protect their intellectual property, and 4) contracting with distributors to promote and secure consumer trust in their product. App developers, trained in software coding and project management, were not well-equipped to carry out these tasks, and the additional steps cost them valuable time and money, with little tangible benefit.</p><p>Without platforms, developers had to take all of these additional steps, creating friction at each point, which meant that the only software titles that were available to the public were those that made the complicated journey from development to publishers to retailers like CompUSA or Best Buy. At one point, in 2003, CompUSA rolled out an early concept of a software platform consisting of a kiosk that burned made-to-order CDs containing software applications. With this system, the retailer could offer more software programs than it could fit on its shelves (which is how software was sold at that time), providing 1,200 titles from 200 different publishers. n6 Now, there are more than 317,673 companies active in the mobile app market in the United States n7 and more than 2 million apps available on the major app platforms. The kiosks are now in our smartphones--there are more than 5.28 billion mobile broadband subscriptions worldwide as of 2018 n8--which are attached to smartphones in the pockets of over 80 percent of Americans n9 and saving them the trip to Best Buy to purchase the box software. n10</p><p>In the internet economy, immediate consumer trust is almost impossible without a substantial online reputation, and not attaining it spells death for any app company. However, what does \"trust\" mean? In this context, trust refers to an established relationship between the app company and consumer where the consumer has the confidence to install the app and disclose otherwise personal information to an app company. Prior to platforms, software developers often handed over their products to companies with a significant reputation to break through the trust barrier.</p><p>Bungie--developer of popular games Halo, Myth, Oni, and Marathon--chronicled in 1996 the difficult and sometimes oppressive distributor requirements placed on software developers that predated the platform ecosystem. When dealing with retail distributors, Bungie was required to guarantee a competitive price, pay 3 to 6 percent of sales as a marketing fee in addition to $10,000 for product launch marketing, pay the shipping costs to deliver their products to distributors, and agree to buy back unsold products. Once contracts were negotiated, software developers were often required to spend additional money so that in-store catalogs would feature their product or retail stores would place their product on an end cap display, all before consumers even saw the products. n11</p><p>However, with the advent of the smartphone, the experience Bungie described is a relic of the past. The smartphone, in its brief history, revolutionized the economy at large and established a symbiotic relationship between platforms and developers. And in the decade since the introduction of the App Store and other platforms, those developers and app companies contributed both to the overall success of smartphones and improved their functionality for consumers.</p><p>At first, developers were reluctant to join platforms, worried that the model might not accommodate their ability to \"launch fast and iterate\" n12 their apps. But successful platforms changed the app ecosystem by providing app developers with ubiquitous access to a broader swath of consumers. Platforms provide a centralized framework for app developers to engage and secure visibility with the 3.4 billion app users n13 worldwide. With lower costs and barriers to entry, both fledgling and established app developers can find success. For example, educational app company L'Escapadou secured 1.3 million downloads and earned more than $1.5 million from app sales between 2010 and 2014, a success attributed to the centralized nature of platforms. Founder Pierre Abel specialized the language, content, and pricing of each of his apps based on consumer and market needs and marketed them on different platforms to reach a variety of consumers around the world. n14</p><p>IV. There's a Platform for That</p><p>As successful as the past 12 years have been for the app economy, the next decade could be even better. In just the first half of 2019, the two major app stores generated $39.7 billion in revenue--a robust n15.4 percent increase over the first half of 2018's $34.4 billion.15 This growth suggests the developer-platform model is still succeeding. Moreover, app economy growth is likely to endure because developers are continuing to create new products, services, and markets that did not exist prior to platforms. Perhaps the most notable of these is the market for ridesharing. Connecting a driver--using his or her own car--to a potential passenger in real-time for an on-demand ride to a destination selected by the passenger was impossible before developers could use the GPS capabilities and data connections of smartphones. Ridesharing is an important example of how app developer ingenuity meets the capabilities, built-in trust, and developer services of platforms to create new options for consumers.</p><p>The same combination of technologies and network effects has produced new possibilities for delivery services. For example, App Association member GetSwift created a white label--that is, a program created by GetSwift but with the client's branding--delivery tool enabling shippers in any type of industry to move their products to their customers quickly, efficiently, and easily. n16 The platform works the same whether the shipper is a rural farm that delivers fresh vegetables to individuals or an office water supplier, n17 as the real-time connectivity it provides reduced late or missed deliveries by 25 percent in some cases. n18</p><p>Just as ridesharing fundamentally changed how we get around, developers and platforms also revolutionized how we access healthcare. A current shortage of about 30,000 physicians in the United States--which is projected to increase to up to 90,000 in the next six years--contributed to the need for caregivers and patients to find new ways of communicating. Compounding the caregiver shortage, 133 million Americans currently live with chronic conditions--most of them residing in rural areas with long drives to their nearest provider. n19 Devices, sensors, and software are now capable of gathering and analyzing physiological data like movement, heart rate, or blood oximetry so that physicians can better monitor their patients at home and address potential problems before they occur or worSen. n20 Studies show that preventive care regimes that use connected health tools are especially useful for patients with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart failure, which tend to affect underserved and rural communities especially. n21 But how do these capabilities reach patients and consumers, specifically those who need them most? Most Americans already interact with platforms, through a variety of different types of devices. We know that smartphone adoption rates are increasing among underserved populations in the United States and that for many, their handheld device is their only means of accessing the internet. n22 Here again, developers are leveraging the ubiquity and trusted framework of platforms to produce healthcare innovations that address a variety of health conditions. Moreover, in this case, the platform-developer dynamic helps caregivers reach patients in rural and underserved areas.</p><p>Finally, the platform-driven app ecosystem gave rise to a new set of business-to-business markets. For example, Aurora, Colorado-based Peafowl is a cross-platform app development firm that creates dynamic websites and mobile applications across several devices and disciplines for clients of all sizes. From rapper Nicki Minaj all the way to small businesses like Groundwurk, Peafowl leverages the major software platforms and smart devices to provide their clients with apps that meet a variety of specific needs. n23 Similarly, Canned Spinach of Cincinnati, Ohio, is a full-service design and development firm that specializes in user experience and user interface design. They were founded in 2016 and boast a client roster including well-known entities like DJ Khaled and Toyota as well as smaller businesses like BodyBoss and This and They. n24 Taking on a software development task for a company like Toyota used to be a job for large companies. Now, the platform-driven internet of things (IoT) revolution has created opportunities for even the smallest companies to create software that makes connected devices come to life. The built-in trust, cloud computing, and distribution of platforms have enabled small companies to compete for major tasks--and these jobs are a significant part of the app ecosystem.</p><p>The competitive conditions over the past 10 years, and presently, suggest that the nature of competition in this space will continue to evolve and benefit consumers on the whole. One of the central markets at issue in the debate around the state of competition in the platform ecosystem--informally, we could call it the market for developer services, where a developer pays a platform for various services including distribution, marketing, etc.--also experiences vigorous competition. There is a tendency to include only two platform companies, Apple and Google, in this category of competitors. But for developers, the market is much wider. A game developer can choose platforms like Epic or Steam and enterprise developers can look to hundreds of proprietary, custom platforms or could create their own. For example, companies like App47 create app platforms for everything from \"bulldozers to ultrasound devices.\" n25 Moreover, for developers looking to reach a general audience, using the web is an alternative, especially for companies that are looking for different kinds of distribution or search services than those available on platforms. Additionally, software developers could choose to advertise on Facebook or distribute their products through Amazon, or one of the giant Chinese platforms. It is worth noting, however, that there are some important distinctions between software platforms--which provide a marketplace for software apps like the App Store or Google Play--and aggregators that connect people with information and run on data. n26 Aggregators like Facebook and Twitter, for example, connect people with information and other people (and generate valuable data in the process), while the Google Play store and the App Store provide a marketplace for consumers and app developers to transact directly. These differences illustrate the diversity in the market for distribution methods, as developers may prefer one model over another.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, the universe of platforms is continuing to evolve and expand as different kinds of hardware begin to connect to the network. New platforms are cropping up for wearables made by companies like Garmin. Connected home devices and cars drive cross-platform interoperability so that Alexa or Cortana can communicate with your Samsung appliances or your Ford Fusion--further weighing against conceptions of platform markets where a single player wields market power. These characteristics tend to show that developer services will continue to improve and evolve along with demand. Federal intervention may be necessary where market power exists and is used to raise prices undisciplined by competition or maintain a monopoly position in order to reduce quality or decrease output. But when those factors are not present and competition drives the market, as it does in developer services, intervention is unlikely to help and may harm competition or consumer welfare.</p><p>V. Platforms Aren't Perfect</p><p>Although developers can choose from multiple platforms, there is no such thing as a perfect platform. Our member companies pay a fee to platforms for developer services, and they expect those services to meet their needs. Just as online companies must clearly communicate their data practices to consumers, so must platforms clearly define the requirements and details of their terms of service to developers. For example, when platforms change their developer guidelines, they must communicate clearly and ensure developers understand what the changes mean for them and their customer relationships. Occasionally, we hear from a member company that an ill-defined change significantly impacted their business. For example, a platform recently put a member company that provides a call blocking app on notice for temporary removal unless it made changes to how it obtained permission for gathering incoming call data. n27 The platform did not clearly explain how its policies changed or why they would necessitate action on the app's part, and it was the first removal notice of its kind in the app's nine years on the platform. Ultimately, the platform did not remove the app, but the process for remaining on the store was opaque and difficult enough to navigate that the company looked to us, their trade association, for help. Relevantly, this occurred amid a major update to California's privacy laws, so it may be an example of the unintended consequences of government intervention.</p><p>Especially for enterprise app developers, a platform's safety and security are important elements of developer services. Platforms' security features improved markedly over the course of their existence. Whereas unlocking a device used to require a four-digit passcode, devices are now capable of biometric-based authentication, and platforms make these authentication measures available to developers as well so that they can also benefit from these heightened security measures. But the game of cat-and-mouse between cybersecurity professionals and hackers will never end, and security must continue to evolve to meet and beat the threats. Although some platforms do not control device security, developers want the platform's security features to work seamlessly with any relevant hardware and that they account for all attack vectors. Platforms should continue to improve their threat sharing and gathering capabilities to ensure they protect developers across the platform, regardless of where threats originate. Moreover, they should approve and deploy software updates with important security updates rapidly to protect consumers as well as developers and their clients and users. The same is true when it comes to privacy controls. App developers strongly desire platform-level privacy controls they can adapt for their products and services. The types and nature of these controls vary among platforms and this variation should result in continuously improving options that iterate with end user expectations and privacy risks.</p><p>Similarly, platforms play an important role in helping small developers enforce their intellectual property (IP) rights. Our member companies' IP helps eliminate the inherent disadvantages of being a small, innovative company by enabling them to protect the fruits of their ingenuity from larger firms that might want to take it. Unfortunately, some of our member companies fall victim to IP thieves that succeed in selling the pirated content or using it to steal ad revenue on platforms. Ad networks can and do help mitigate the pirated ad revenue problem, n28 but platforms must also vigorously police their app stores for stolen content. With vast online stores, it is difficult for a platform to verify legitimate requests to remove allegedly pirated content. But a single app developer should not need the help of a legal team or trade association to resolve the issue. In one instance, an App Association member company, Busy Bee Studios, approached us when it was unable to convince the platform to investigate an app that appeared to have been stolen from Busy Bee. With our assistance, the platform investigated the issue and found that the infringing app was in fact stolen content. n29 But the time and resources it took our member company--which only has a few employees--to resolve the issue were significant and could have gone toward the development of their next app. Since this issue arose, IP resolution processes improved across the board, but the story is a reminder that they are important and in-demand developer services that platforms should improve in order to compete for developers.</p><p>VI. Congress Can Help Maintain a Level Playing Field</p><p>Our members' ability to create jobs and develop innovative software depends on strong IP protections and access to talent. In order to ensure the growth of the app economy, small, innovative companies must be able to pursue IP claims affordably and challenge claims that should not have been granted in the first place. For instance, we applaud the House of Representatives' recent passage of the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2019 (H.R. 2426), which would establish a voluntary small claims board at the Copyright Office, a less-expensive alternative for companies with important infringement claims but fewer resources. n30 Similarly, when it comes to patents our members support the current process for inter partes review (IPR) because IPR proceedings cost on average in the low six-figure range versus up to $5 million for a typical patent in federal court. While the low six-figures is still out of reach financially for many small businesses, an IPR provides much-needed leverage to companies faced with the possibility of litigation in federal court. n31 Finally, we urge members of the Committee to ensure that K-12 and college students alike have the opportunity to enroll in computer science classes and learn to code. There are almost 500,000 open computing jobs, n32 which earn an average of over $90,000, n33 while far fewer Americans are graduating with computer science training each year. Congress should be looking for every opportunity to equip students at all levels with the skills necessary to take these jobs.</p><p>VII.Conclusion</p><p>We appreciate this opportunity to provide testimony in this important hearing. Our member companies have a strong interest in maintaining a competitive app economy that enables them to compete with larger firms worldwide through innovative products and services for their customers and clients. The entry of platforms created novel opportunities for consumers and developers. But while platforms provide some of the infrastructure, developers bring smart devices to life. Without apps, a smartphone is just a phone. The symbiotic relationship between apps and platforms is not perfect, but it has created a powerful ecosystem that continues to benefit consumers. We look forward to discussing the pro-competitive effects and public policy concerns platforms have generated and welcome the discussion around how large, tech-driven firms affect smaller counterparts.</p><p>n1 See, e.g., Brief for ACT | The App Association as Amicus Curiae Supporting Petitioner, Apple v.

Not only have these services allowed small businesses to extend their existing reach, but they have also created exciting new opportunities for entirely new small businesses. YouTube (owned by Google) and Twitch (owned by Amazon) have allowed tens of thousands of people to make their living through content creation, forming small businesses employing others. n1 Online shopping sites such as Amazon, Etsy and eBay have not only expanded the reach of traditional merchants, but also created new business opportunities for resellers and local distributors that suit local community needs. The Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Communities of Lakewood and Brooklyn, for example, has found that signing up as Amazon partners offers them flexibility that is well suited to the religious restrictions of Sabbath and religious holidays. n2</p><p>At the same time, the dominance of a handful of massive companies in online retail, online search, online video and social media creates enormous problems for small businesses. These problems can be divided into two categories. First, small businesses face potential obstacles when they potentially compete with digital platforms. For example, there have been repeated reports that Amazon harvests information from third party vendors to develop competing products. n3 (Amazon claims it does not do this and has no incentive to do so.) There is evidence from leaked emails that Facebook used its control over application programming interfaces (APIs) to block competitors and extort concessions from app developers once it reached dominance in the social media market. n4 In 2017, the European Commission antitrust authority found that Google violated EU antitrust laws by favoring its affiliated content in its \"Google shopping\" service. n5</p><p>Importantly, however, small businesses that use digital platforms as necessary inputs for their businesses can face enormous costs and barriers to entry even when they do not compete against the platform. Giant platforms, lacking competition and focused on maximizing their own revenue and preserving their own quality of service, can cause havoc with small businesses through poorly implemented decisions or imposing cumbersome and expensive processes. For example, rivals have been known to sabotage each other on platforms such as Amazon and YouTube with fake complaints, forcing small businesses to undertake expensive and complicated appeals processes. n6 Changes in monetization policies or search algorithms can cause small businesses - through no fault of their own - to experience a sudden unanticipated drop in revenue. n7 Changes in policy by giants such as Amazon can force smaller platforms such as Etsy to change their own policies to compete, shifting costs to the small merchants that use these rival platforms. n8</p><p>In other words, giant platforms present a danger to small businesses not simply when they deliberately try to put them at a disadvantage. Like the proverbial bull in the china shop, giant digital platforms are simply incapable of controlling how even their rational business decisions can have unanticipated and disastrous impacts on the small businesses dependent on them. It therefore lies with Congress to set necessary safeguards that balance providing a stable and competitive environment for small businesses while preserving the valuable features of digital platforms.</p><p>Lessons From The Physical World and the Last 150 Years of Communications Policy.</p><p>In the physical world, there is a well-developed body of law to prevent both deliberate anticompetitive conduct and to prevent providers of necessary business inputs from distorting the market. For example, there is an entire body of commercial real estate law that prevents landlords from unilaterally changing the terms on small businesses with no notice. A shopping mall owner could not, for example, simply lock a merchant out of their store for some presumed violation of the shopping mall's policy. But most digital platforms can - and do - shut down online merchants or impose various other penalties for purported infractions without any sort of notice or appeal process. n9 There are rules that govern necessary inputs such as telecommunications or electricity so that providers of these vital services cannot squeeze merchants dependent on them into agreeing to onerous terms and conditions. But there are no such rules in the digital space. To the contrary, small businesses are left vulnerable in the online world in ways they have not been in the real world for over a century.</p><p>Below, I discuss important reforms Congress should consider to protect small businesses in cyberspace comparable to those they enjoy today in the physical world. While we must increase antitrust enforcement and improve antitrust law, we must also recognize the limits of antitrust law.</p><p>In my book The Case for the Digital Platform Act, n10 I argue that the rise of digital platforms reflects the latest iteration of disruptive communications technology. In the 150 years since the telegraph revolutionized every aspect of society from commerce to foreign relations to news reporting, society observed how dramatic changes in communications technology produce equally dramatic and disruptive changes in society. This should come as no surprise. At heart, all human interaction that creates society and commerce is communication. When society changes the nature of how people communicate, then society also changes the nature of how people do business. At the same time, however, society's fundamental values guide how people address these challenges. Our commitment to democracy, competition, consumer protection and public safety provide the necessary foundation for how our laws respond to the challenges these new communication technologies create.</p><p>Below, I summarize the relevant sections and recommendations for the committee. First, I discuss the importance of defining digital platforms and distinguishing between \"dominant\" and \"non-dominant\" platforms. Behavior that is neutral, or even pro-consumer or pro-competitive, when done by a small business in a competitive environment can be harmful when done by a dominant firm. This is particularly true in the digital platform space because of the enormous network effects that dominant digital platforms enjoy and the susceptibility of digital markets to \"tipping.\" n11 Next, I make specific recommendations for legislative remedies that Congress could adopt, either individually or as part of a package, to create a new \"digital authority\" as recommended both in The Case for the Digital Platform Act and by several recent expert reports. I will focus specifically on measures to protect small businesses from anti-competitive conduct by platforms, certain pro-competitive regulations such as interoperability, how \"filter bubbles\" and other problems with search and recommendation algorithms harm small businesses, and protections against arbitrary treatment. Finally, I will discuss how antitrust law can and cannot promote a digital environment in which small businesses can thrive.</p><p>Defining Digital Platforms and What Constitutes \"Dominance\" In The Digital Platform Space.</p><p>Nearly every business today incorporates digital technology. Additionally, numerous businesses with radically different business models claim for various reasons to be \"platforms\" or digital platforms. Should the law treat businesses such as Google Search and other online businesses such as Netflix, or internet access providers such as Verizon or Comcast, the same? What distinguishes a would-be digital platform such as WeWork from a genuine digital platform such as Twitter? Defining what makes this particular sector of the economy unique makes clear the impact of \"big tech\" (as distinguishable from \"big business\" generally) on small businesses. In the last year, in addition to my own analysis, three separate expert reports have reached similar conclusions on what distinguishes digital platforms from other businesses. n12</p><p>First, digital platforms do not provide internet access themselves. Instead, they are available through the internet. This radically changes the cost structure and enables rapid growth not possible for physical networks such as ISPs. Second, digital platforms enjoy powerful network effects. There is some argument as to what factors are most significant in creating these network effects, but they include: the ability of the platform to enable multisided markets and self-organizing subnetworks networks (e.g., users can be simultaneously buyers and sellers, can create multiple distinct groups, and can engage in multiple activities on the same platforms simultaneously); platforms can use personal information to manipulate users without their knowledge; and platforms can achieve a sufficient head start over rivals that it becomes almost impossible for new entrants to directly challenge the dominant platform (\"tipping point economies\").</p><p>These factors also create tremendous benefits for users. Collecting personal information enables platforms to customize features for enhanced service efficiency. Delivering service via the internet enables platforms to provide \"always on\" service (even if, as in the case of online shopping, goods and services may be delivered offline, they may be ordered at any time). The ability of users to self-organize and to simultaneously occupy multiple roles on the platform enables users (and small businesses) to enjoy unique business and social opportunities. At the same time, however, these attributes create the potential for tremendous competitive harms.</p><p>The Difference Between Net Neutrality and Search Neutrality. For political reasons, industry lobbyists over the years have sought to conflate internet access providers and \"edge\" providers such as digital platforms. These two businesses have radically different cost structures and business models. While the history of telecommunications (including broadband) provides useful information about networked industries centered on human speech, rote mechanical application of rules governing one business to the other is a recipe for disaster. It would be like applying the same regulations to airplanes and buses because \"both are passenger vehicles for transportation.\"</p><p>The difference between digital platforms that use the internet and broadband providers that offer access to the internet is best illustrated by the difference between what \"neutrality\" means in the internet access context and the search context. As a principle of ensuring reliability and avoiding anticompetitive conduct, the basic concept of non-discrimination works reasonably well. But consider the difference in application between an internet service provider and a search engine.</p><p>An ISP simply delivers information from one location to another - classic telecommunications, generally referred to as \"common carrier.\" For \"neutrality\" to apply in this context, the ISP needs to reliably deliver the information without any artificial distinction in service. The user buys transmission, the ISP provides it. Nothing more is required for the system to function, and the users on either end of the connection desire nothing more than that the system work in the same reliable way every time.</p><p>Now consider a search engine. What would it mean for a search engine to be a \"common carrier\"? The entire point of a search engine is to help a user sort through the billions of potential pieces of information available so that the user can find the most relevant information. This is entirely different from the function the user wants from the ISP, where the user already knows the information they want transmitted. It is like the difference between the telephone and an information directory. A person used to dial \"411\" to speak to a human being to help them sort through information to find the phone number, and the human at the information desk would then use the phone system to connect him.</p><p>This does not mean that concepts of \"nondiscrimination\" or \"neutrality\" have no application to search (either in a search engine such as Google or a recommendation algorithm such as a Facebook newsfeed). It is simply that they must express themselves in very different ways, and that mechanically applying the definition of \"neutrality\" from telecommunications to digital platforms would be a disaster. In the context of digital platforms such as search, as I discuss in greater detail below, nondiscrimination requires a certain level of transparency as to the nature of the search criteria and prohibiting selfdealing or deception. For example, Amazon was accused recently of altering its recommendation algorithm to make recommendations based on what products would be most profitable to Amazon, rather than on correlations with consumer preferences. n13 This violates \"neutrality\" to the detriment of small businesses trying to compete directly with the platform.</p><p>As this illustration shows, trying to compare the behavior of infrastructure providers such as ISPs or cloud storage providers to those of digital platforms is a recipe for bad policy outcomes. Legislative solutions should be designed to level the playing field between small businesses and big tech, not between big tech and big telecom.</p><p>Measuring the Cost of Exclusion. One of the difficulties in addressing market power is how to measure dominance. The term \"digital platforms\" covers a wide range of businesses, with giant platforms potentially able to impact or influence small businesses in ways traditional antitrust law has difficulty defining. Additionally, for a remedy to protect small businesses effectively, it must either blunt the impact of a dominant platform's actions or reduce the market power of a digital platform so that new entrants can compete.</p><p>Additionally, behaviors that are anticompetitive in dominant firms may be procompetitive in smaller firms. Again, rote mechanical application of the same rules and standards does not produce fairness or a \"level playing field.\" The law imposes additional obligations on dominant firms as a remedy to their exceptional market power and as a mechanism for promoting competition. Once the market becomes competitive and the previously dominant firm becomes non-dominant, the additional safeguards imposed to limit abuses of market power can be removed. But it requires a reasonable test of dominance to avoid removing these safeguards prematurely - especially in a market subject to tipping, such as this one.</p><p>I have proposed the cost of exclusion from the platform (COE) as the appropriate measure of dominance. As I explain in greater detail in The Case for the Digital Platform Act, once a platform achieves a sufficient size, businesses suffer a significant, nontransient harm from losing access to the platform (either losing literal access through deplatforming, or by effectively disappearing as a result of being degraded in search results and disappearing from recommendations as a consequence of anticompetitive discrimination). The measurable cost of exclusion from the platform can be considered a measure of a platforms market power. If a small business can walk away from a platform with little loss of potential business, then the platform should not be considered dominant. On the other hand, if losing access to the platform can mean a significant drop in revenue or significant increase in expense, then the platform has significant market power and should be considered dominant.</p><p>Use of COE illustrates why small businesses require protection even from unintended consequences of dominant firms. When YouTube changes its monetization policy, for example, the impact is felt by tens of thousands of small content creators. n14 Facebook's decision to prioritize \"quality engagement\" rather than extreme content in its newsfeed and recommendations had enormous impact on news outlets that had - for better or worse - optimized their headlines and coverage around Facebook's previous algorithm. n15 Even though moving away from an emphasis on \"engagement\" that placed greater value to more extreme content over more informative content was a positive change made in response to widespread criticism, the way in which it was done created significant disruption for thousands of news outlets and content creators unprepared for the change.</p><p>Finally, recent actions by Amazon illustrate how dominant firms can directly target vulnerable small businesses to offload costs and to deny small businesses access to competing platforms at more favorable terms. For example, Amazon has been accused of penalizing sellers when their products are available for lower prices on Walmart.com. n16 This summer, Amazon imposed a new refund policy that requires merchants who do not ship through Amazon to accept returned merchandise in the same way sellers who use Amazon do. This leaves businesses that feel they cannot leave Amazon with two choices: eat the cost or switch to Amazon's delivery service. n17</p><p>To be clear, this does not mean that dominant firms should be locked into the same technology or same set of algorithms forever. Rather, this highlights the need to impose due process obligations on dominant platforms to ensure that small businesses have the stability they need to thrive.</p><p>Measures to Promote Competition: The Case for the Digital Platform Act.</p><p>Several recent reports have urged creation of a new \"digital authority\" to promote competition in the digital platform space. n18 Public Knowledge similarly believes that the digital platform sector is sufficiently important to the economy and to society generally to require a specialized agency empowered to affirmatively promote competition, protect consumers, ensure a robust marketplace of ideas, and protect public safety. Congress has historically moved cautiously in expanding sector specific regulation. Our recommendations are therefore designed to work individually as well as in combination.</p><p>Data portability. One important feature in digital platform dominance is the collection and use of personal data from customers. This is particularly important for small businesses trying to maintain relationships with customers. Requiring platforms to honor requests from customers to move data to other platforms in usable formats has been recommended by many experts as a way to enhance competition. n19 In the small business context, it would enable customers to move information from the platform to the small business if the customer chooses, decreasing dependence on the platform intermediary, in addition to moving information to businesses that directly compete with the platform.</p><p>Open APIs, licensing essential patents, and interoperability. Interoperability is critically important for application developers. Disturbing reports of Facebook's \"Switcheroo\" plan detail how Facebook initially encouraged application developers to invest in Facebook applications with the understanding that they would have continued access to the necessary application interfaces. n20 Once Facebook achieved dominance, it used its power over these developers to extract concessions, such as requiring the app developers to spend over $300,000 in advertising on Facebook's mobile platform or lose access. n21</p><p>Public Knowledge proposes eliminating significant barriers to interoperability for competitors and for businesses using a platform as an essential input. For example, content creators should be able to use the same applications to create content for diverse platforms such as YouTube, Twitch and Facebook without worrying that one of the important platforms will take steps to force them into proprietary applications. The history of the telecommunications industry shows that interconnection creates competition and creates stability for small businesses, since they can use interconnected competitors to access reliably their customers on competing platforms.</p><p>For the same reason, Public Knowledge recommends that companies that hold patents or copyrights that are essential to industry standards be required to license their intellectual property on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND). This does not mean that intellectual property holders must make their IP available for free. But FRAND licensing has been an important tool to prevent firms from using their IP to freeze out potential competitors or impose terms that prevent others from developing new, disruptive business models. n22</p><p>Restricting use of information collected from commercial rivals and prohibiting \"most favored nation\" clauses. When small businesses use digital platforms, they expose some of their most sensitive proprietary information to the platform. Indeed, for the relationship to work, the platform must \"know\" details such as the popularity of a specific product, whether or not there are returns, and customer billing information. A platform may also legitimately require proof of quality control and proof of capacity to meet specific demand thresholds. Nothing prevents platforms from using this information to develop rival products and services and compete directly with the small businesses that use the platform. Indeed, there are persistent accusations that platforms such as Amazon engage in precisely this kind of behavior. n23</p><p>Even without using information gleaned from the commercial relationship between the small business and the platform, dominant platforms can use their market power to require that small businesses provide them with terms as favorable as (or better than) those given to any rival platform. These \"most favored nation\" (MFN) policies prevent small businesses from taking advantage of efforts by potential competitors to compete against the dominant platform. The policies force small businesses to maintain higher prices even if the would-be competing platform offers superior terms in other respects. The ability of large platforms to conduct massive internet searches across multiple potential sales platforms gives the dominant platform an overwhelming advantage against any small business attempting to take advantage of competition between digital platforms.</p><p>Public Knowledge therefore proposes measures that have demonstrated effectiveness in the communications market. First, Public Knowledge proposes limitations on the use of proprietary information collected by the platform as part of its business dealings with small businesses. This type of information is known in communications law as \"customer proprietary network information\" (CPNI). n24 CPNI recognizes that although the network must \"know\" certain types of highly proprietary information to function, the law can limit the ability of the rival network to use this information for purposes other than the contracted service. n25</p><p>Second, Public Knowledge proposes prohibiting punitive MFN clauses, or other mechanisms that prevent small businesses from finding alternatives to the dominant platform. Allowing small businesses to move freely between platforms without fear of reprisals is critical to maintaining a competitive environment and limiting the ability of dominant platforms to abuse small businesses dependent on them. It also promotes the development of competition, since dominant platforms cannot use their market power to prevent small businesses from patronizing rivals and enhancing their likelihood of success.</p><p>Non-discrimination, transparency and 'black box testing.' A repeated concern by small businesses and consumers alike is that platforms may favor content for reasons having nothing to do with consumer preferences. Whether it is Google Search, or Amazon's search engine and recommendations, or any other ordering and presentation of information, the platform has tremendous opportunity to discriminate in a number of ways without the consumer knowing. The most obvious concern is favoring affiliated products or down-ranking rivals. But platforms may also take money to prioritize search without disclosing this fact.</p><p>At the same time, businesses have incentive to \"game the system\" and try to manipulate search results. In the United States, \"search engine optimization\" (SEO), essentially the business of trying to get to the top of Google's search page, is a multibillion dollar business. n26 Bad actors have routinely used understanding of how YouTube and Facebook optimize their recommendation and news feed algorithms for \"engagement\" to promote content designed to radicalize or undermine democratic discourse. Creating a truly transparent system to verify non-discrimination is therefore highly inadvisable.</p><p>In that case, the best solution is \"black box testing.\" n27 Where a party has reason to believe that search and recommendation results are manipulated to discriminate in an inappropriate fashion, the party would file a complaint with the enforcing agency. The enforcing agency would then be given access to the code for testing purposes. The enforcing agency would then determine whether or not reasonable grounds exists to open an investigation. The complaining party would not get access to the code, thus avoiding the ability of parties to use the complaint process as a pretext to gain access to proprietary algorithms to reverse engineer them.</p><p>Product unbundling and structural separation. When the combination of products creates both a powerful incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct and the structure of the company makes it difficult to otherwise police anticompetitive conduct, it makes sense to consider product unbundling and structural separation. Historically, these two remedies represent a range from requiring separate accounting within an intact firm to wholly separating the company into affiliated firms with entirely separate governance (even if they remain commonly owned). Typically, structural separation is created under the supervision of a court or an agency to ensure that it successfully creates lines of division that reduce or eliminate the incentive to favor one's own product and make it possible to police non-discrimination easily.</p><p>For example, beginning in the 1970s and continuing until Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required that incumbent telephone networks (first the ATandT monopoly, then the \"Baby Bells\") only offer certain types of service through a separate affiliate. For example,</p><p>ATandT offered an alarm service. To ensure that it competed on equal terms with rival alarm companies, ATandT was required to offer this alarm service through an entirely separate affiliate, with separate corporate headquarters and separate facilities and workforce. Because ATandT was required to tariff the cost of interconnection with its phone network, n28 the FCC could make sure that ATandT the phone company offered the same rate to every alarm company - including ATandT's own affiliate.</p><p>Product unbundling works somewhat differently from structural separation. With product unbundling, a seller has a suite of products it may wish to sell as a unit, but regulators require it \"unbundle\" and sell the components separately. For example, in the 1990s, the United States required that local telephone companies sell unbundled access to various elements of the local network at regulated wholesale prices to potential competitors. The theory was that this would allow competition to emerge as competitors initially gained access to customers by leasing unbundled elements from the local monopoly provider, which would provide them with revenue to build out independent networks where economically feasible.</p><p>To illustrate with examples in the digital platform space, requiring Amazon to separate its retail business \"Amazon Essentials\" from its online merchant platform and operate them as entirely separate companies (even while allowing them to remain commonly owned) would be an example of structural separation. Alternatively, requiring Amazon to separate various services it currently requires third party sellers to take as a bundle and allowing them to pick which ones they wish to use would be an example of unbundling.</p><p>Structural separation and unbundling can be a very effective means of introducing competition and providing a level playing field for small businesses. The difficulty of implementing these regimes, however, should not be underestimated. Both structural separation and unbundling require ongoing regulatory supervision to ensure that the platform follows the rules. While the need for pervasive monitoring and supervision can be reduced in a well-designed system, it cannot be wholly eliminated as the economic factors that drove the consolidation in the first place will, absent some countervailing force, drive the separated pieces to reconsolidate.</p><p>Break ups and the Starfish problem. Sometimes, the only way to restore competitive balance to the marketplace is by breaking up a company into separate components. A successful break up will identify and separate the \"natural monopoly\" component for specific regulation, while simultaneously separating out those lines of business that reinforce the existing monopoly or monopolies.</p><p>The ATandT break-up is generally acknowledged as the most successful break-up in the last 50 years. It illustrates both the potential rewards of dismantling a set of interconnected and reinforcing monopolies and the enormous investment required to do so. The final litigation that concluded in the settlement breaking up ATandT into a longdistance company, an equipment manufacturing company, an information/yellow pages publisher and regional bell operating companies (\"RBOCS,\" aka the \"Baby Bells\") took ten years and the combined efforts of the Department of Justice and the FCC. The FCC conducted multiple proceedings to ensure that the break-up did not disrupt the phone system, and preserved service in rural areas subsidized by ATandT's regulated monopoly rates. Even after the break-up in 1984, the FCC continued to regulate ATandT longdistance as a dominant carrier until 1995. n29</p><p>Once the Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed legal barriers to the telecommunications monopoly reconstituting itself, the market proceeded on a steady march to concentration. While not a monopoly, the current communications market has been described as an \"oligopoly on steroids.\" n30 The same fundamental economic factors that created the ATandT monopoly once again drove the communications market to concentration - a process which continues unabated with the recent acquisition of Sprint by T-Mobile. Broadband, which was supposed to provide the competitive antidote, is divided in most markets between a higher-speed cable offering and a lower speed DSL offering from the legacy telephone company.</p><p>This reconstituted communications oligopoly 35 years after the break-up of the original \"Ma Bell,\" is an example of the \"starfish problem.\" Tear up a starfish and it simply regrows the missing limbs. While not all monopolies suffer from the starfish problem, this natural regeneration of concentration will occur in any market where the underlying economic structure of the market itself drives toward concentration.</p><p>For this reason, although vigorous antitrust investigation and enforcement against dominant platforms is necessary, even the largest platforms can not simply be broken into pieces as a means of solving existing competition problems. Before any break-up, Congress must carefully consider what regulatory framework will prevent the market from simply returning to its highly concentrated state.</p><p>The Importance of Due Process.</p><p>Due process does not extend simply to government action. n31 Small businesses depend on a wide body of law protecting their rights to notice in the physical world. If a small business rents a storefront or space in a shopping mall, a body of commercial real estate law protects the business from arbitrary changes by the landlord and protects the shopkeeper from certain abusive behaviors. A small business can contract for critical inputs such as electricity or telecommunications or water service, confident that these utilities are subject to special regulation because society recognizes their vital importance as an input to small businesses.</p><p>Again, the point is not to replicate commercial real estate law or public utility law in the digital space. To the contrary, as I have repeated throughout this testimony, mechanical rote application of traditional law to digital platforms is a recipe for disaster. But the basic principle that both economic efficiency and fundamental fairness entitle small businesses to due process before losing access to essential services or experiencing dramatic changes in contract terms applies equally in cyberspace as in physical space. Distinguishing between dominant firms and non-dominant firms gives a starting point for discussion. When the decision of a single company can impact the bottom line of tens of thousands of small businesses, basic notice and protection become more urgent than when the stakes are lower. In the same vein, the nature of the notice and protections due should depend on the level of potential impact.</p><p>For example, Amazon has such a complicated and arcane set of rules around its appeals process that an entire cottage industry has developed to help small businesses navigate through it. n32 The problem extends outside of Amazon. Users routinely complain that they do not understand platform policies, nor do they feel well treated by their appeal process. n33 And, as mentioned above, content creators and third party sellers often find themselves given short \"take it or leave it\" notice for major changes imposing significant cost. Finally, in the cut-throat world of online retail, small business competitors may \"hack\" the processes of platforms to sabotage their rivals. n34</p><p>A recent high-profile case on YouTube involving creator Lindsay Ellis illustrates how the lack of an appeals process can have significant impact for small businesses. Lindsay Ellis creates content for YouTube, and employs four people in her production studio. n35 As part of a video essay critical of Disney's effort to obscure its problematic history on racism, Ellis included a 5 second clip from the original animated Dumbo containing offensive lyrics from \"the Song of the Roustabouts.\" UMG holds the copyright to the Song of the Roustabouts. When YouTube's Copyright ID system identified the 5-second clip as part of a song belonging to UMG, it did not conduct a fair use analysis. YouTube offered UMG the option to monetize Ellis' work by inserting advertising in Ellis' video. This not only unjustly allowed UMG to profit from Ellis' intellectual property (the use of the clip clearly falling into the category of fair use), but interfered with Ellis' sponsorship contract with Audible, which prohibits internal advertising in Ellis' video essays that it sponsors. When Ellis complained to YouTube, she was informed that YouTube provided no appeal process and that she would need to go to court to vindicate her fair use claim.</p><p>The point here is not that YouTube should not have a Content ID system. The point is that by failing to provide an appeal system, YouTube has privileged the complainant over the defendant and privileged large businesses that can afford expensive litigation over small businesses that cannot. Indeed, under applicable law, had UMG ordered YouTube to take down Ellis' video as infringing, Ellis would have been entitled to issue a counter-notice to YouTube to restore the video pending court review. n36 But because YouTube has decided to give the complaining rights holder an option to monetize the alleged infringement rather than demand a takedown, Ellis' statutory due process right has been abrogated.</p><p>As this example illustrates, a decision that a platform believes will benefit small businesses (providing a copyright complainant with an option other than takedown) can actually prove harmful to small businesses without appropriate due process. As this example also illustrates, there is no clear solution. Ideally, competition would prevent any single platform from becoming dominant, so that unintended consequences on one platform would not have broad impact and best practices could emerge as a function of competition between platforms. Absent this, however, Congress must consider how to encourage or require platforms to develop processes that treat small businesses fairly.</p><p>Small Businesses, Social Media, and the Problem of Filter Bubbles.</p><p>Small businesses rely on social media both directly and indirectly. Small businesses may themselves be content producers or offer businesses that rely directly on social media platforms. More commonly, small businesses use social media platforms to communicate with potential customers and to attract interest. A viral video or Tweet can drive business and increase search optimization. One of the contributing factors to the success of the Instant Pot was the organic growth of its Facebook community as a place to exchange recipes and generally encourage people to feel that owning an Instant Pot made them part of a community. n37</p><p>But small businesses may find themselves stymied by the tendency of recommendation algorithms to recommend to people increasingly homogenous content. Dubbed \"filter bubbles,\" this phenomena challenges the ability of new content providers to find an audience. As legal scholar Cass Sunstein has argued, traditional media have an \"architecture of serendipity.\" n38 Go to a movie theater and you will see marquis for all the movies playing at the theater, even if you might not normally look for movies of that particular genre. Flip through television channels and you may stumble across an unexpectedly interesting TV show. Peruse the shelves of a bookstore and you may discover books from authors you never knew existed.</p><p>Increasingly, this experience cannot happen on digital platforms - to the detriment of small businesses. Recommendations are typically based on a combination of personal information (what the individual has previously watched before) and aggregate information (\"people who liked this also liked that\"). As the algorithm becomes more familiar with the individual user, its recommendations focus on content more and more similar to what the user watched previously, or what similarly situated people watched previously. Unlike the physical world, where the possibility of discovering something new increases with the length of time spent searching, the possibility of discovering something genuinely different actually decreases the longer someone uses the service. Addressing this \"filter bubble\" problem is complicated. Forcing users to look at content they do not want to see \"for their own good\" will create resentment. But the entire point of an \"architecture of serendipity\" is that the user actually would enjoy the content if they had the opportunity to discover it under circumstances that replicated browsing a bookstore or other situation where a person is searching for new content.</p><p>One approach I recommend is called the \"wobbly algorithm.\" Algorithms generate a probability curve of content the user is likely to find engaging. Generally, given the limited space available, the algorithm recommends only a few choices at the very peak of the curve. What if, on some random number of recommendations, the algorithm recommended items slightly lower down the curve on either side? These would still fall within a general range of interest for the user, but they would not move in the same inexorable straight line as always selecting from the peak of the curve. Over time, this \"wobbly algorithm\" would introduce a significantly wider variety of content, but still falling within the range of content likely to appeal to the specific user.</p><p>Special Concerns Relating to App Stores.</p><p>Many application developers have a beneficial relationship with the platform they develop for. By making platforms more useful and versatile, they provide value to the platform owner itself, and to users. Platforms, in turn, provide them with a customer base, distribution, technical and payment services, and other things. In recent years, app stores have made it easier than ever for users to install software while being assured that it is secure, and security techniques like sandboxing and code-signing can protect user data and device integrity.</p><p>However, the relationship doesn't always go smoothly, especially when the interests of the platform owner and the app developer may not align--for example, when the app developer creates apps that compete with those produced by the platform itself.</p><p>At these times, the very techniques that are used to benefit users and developers in most cases can become tools used for anticompetitive purposes.</p><p>The conflict between platforms and application developers has several flashpoints. Platform owners may privilege their own apps by preinstalling them on devices, and making it impossible to change certain defaults. Platform developers control the app stores that developers need to access to reach users, and could simply deny access to the store for alleged violations of the rules. App store rules themselves may be anticompetitive--and first-party apps might not even have to follow them. Platforms create the APIs that developers need to interact with, and these APIs in part determine the capabilities of apps. The APIs that developers are permitted to interact with may not give third-party apps the same functionality as first-party apps, and using the \"private APIs\" that platform owners can make free use of may be enough to block an app from an app store. Even the content guidelines that platforms establish may be problematic, if they prevent users from accessing lawful or politically sensitive content that is otherwise lawful.</p><p>The solution to these problems, however, cannot be to sacrifice user convenience and security by giving up the benefits that app stores and secure platforms provide. Instead, major platforms should prioritize the interests of users, and do a better job of creating an equal playing field for third-party developers. For example, a platform's own app store should not be the only way to install software on a device. With the safeguards provided by security techniques like sandboxing, code-signing, and app notarization in place, n39 users should be able to \"sideload\" software from the web. Public APIs should allow third-party apps to be fully competitive with platform-provided apps. Third-party apps that provide access to media like music, movies, and ebooks should not have to use platform-provided billing systems that make it impossible for developers to turn a profit. Additionally, while it is appropriate for the creators of major platforms to provide users with a functional \"out of the box\" experience by preloading certain basic apps like email and a web browser, users should be able to change their defaults, and other apps (e.g., a video streaming service) should have to compete on a level playing field in the app store.</p><p>While policies like this can go a long way toward promoting competition and user choice while protecting security, a recent concrete example may illustrate why a sector-specific regulator is needed--to deal with specific factual scenarios it is unreasonable to expect Congress to have legislated about in advance, and where antitrust remedies may not be adequate.</p><p>In iOS 13, Apple limited the ability of third-party apps to gather location information in the background. While this may have some unintentional side effects on some categories of app, as a general matter this can be seen as an improvement to user privacy, and even a method to prolong an iPhone's battery life. However, Apple's own Maps app is not affected by this rule change--not because Apple has allowed the Maps app to collect location information in the background, but because location information for \"Routing and Traffic\" and \"Improve Maps\" is collected not by the Maps app but by the system itself. To opt out of this data collection, users have to go into the Settings app, chose \"Privacy,\" then \"Location Services,\" then \"System Services\" to locate the appropriate setting. By contrast, users have to use the Settings app to opt in to allow a third-party app to continually collect location data in the background--the app itself cannot offer that option at all. But the solution to this isn't to simply ask that Apple allow for indiscriminate data collection by apps--it is to require that Apple follow the same rules for data collection that it imposes on third parties, or to require that it makes the (non-personally identifiable) data that it collects available to third-party apps so that they can make the same use of it that Apple itself does.</p><p>This example shows that, with digital platforms, issues of privacy, security, competition, and even user experience can all arise together from a single decision. Deciding in advance as a matter of policy to optimize for one at the expense of the others would lead to a bad outcome. Thus, a unified approach is needed, and a single digital platform regulator would be best-suited to provide it.</p><p>The Role of Antitrust.</p><p>Traditionally, small businesses have benefited from pro-competition laws and rules, as well as strong antitrust enforcement, that kept consolidated power in check. This allowed small businesses greater room to thrive and provided them with a variety of options to choose from for their necessary inputs and paths to market. Over the last forty years, a de-regulatory spirit swept away many of these pro-competition policies, and the antitrust laws have been increasingly narrowed by judicial precedents based on economics that is now called into question. n40 Antitrust law needs targeted improvements in order to fulfill this important role again.</p><p>At the same time, America's antitrust agencies need to increase enforcement of our antitrust laws. The FTC, DOJ, and state attorneys general are investigating the dominant platforms for potential antitrust violations. This is a positive step. It's imperative that our antitrust enforcers scrutinize these companies to discover whether they have committed violations of the antitrust laws and stop and remedy any violations that have occurred. It's important that the FTC, DOJ, and State Attorneys General devote the appropriate resources to make these investigations successful.</p><p>But digital platforms are a special case. Economists have identified digital platform markets as being particularly prone to tipping, with or without antitrust violations. n41 As a result, antitrust will only go so far towards building competition in an industry where there is currently very little competition. Antitrust enforcement must wait until anticompetitive conduct occurs, and remedies are limited to correcting the impacts of that anticompetitive conduct. Antitrust enforcers rarely get the opportunity to restructure industries in the big and continuing ways that are needed. A comprehensive regulatory plan is required to fully address the problems of competition in digital platforms.</p><p>Thank you and I am prepared to answer any questions at this time.</p><p>n1 See David J.

Code-signing is a cryptographic feature that ensures that an app comes from a specific developer, and prevents code from running if it has been modified after having been signed. Notarization is similar to code-signing, but involves the platform owner signing an app after checking it for malware and other issues. Both codesigning and app notarization allow an app to be remotely prevented from running if it is discovered to be malicious. Apps distributed through app stores are typically signed. Platforms can decide whether to require that apps be signed in some way, or can encourage if not require that apps be signed through certain user interface design choices.</p><p>n40 Jonathan B.

Your exploration of Big Tech's impact on small business is extraordinarily valuable because you understand small business; you are the champions of small business. I encourage you to consider these issues carefully and to voice your opinions loudly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today I will use our time together to share what I have learned from thousands of 3C small businesspeople.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3C supports small businesses as a resource and an advocate. We promote access to and adoption of digital technologies and tools; provide resources and education to help optimize small businesses' digital opportunity; and cultivate a policy environment that considers and respects small businesses. 3C wants small businesses to succeed and we believe that digital technologies and tools give small businesses the best opportunity to succeed. A recent Deloitte study found that effective use of digital technology by small businesses resulted in markedly higher revenue, substantially greater profitability, and many more jobs created.</p><p>At 3C, we spend most of our time talking to and supporting small businesses. We have hosted SkillsConnect workshops nationwide, including in New York, Cincinnati, Boulder, Brooklyn, Sacramento, and Austin. We have been pleased to welcome Chairwoman Velasquez and Representative Chabot to our events so you can meet our members and hear their stories.</p><p>In many ways, 3C member businesses differ from one another. They include restaurants, authors and publishers, executive coaches, plumbing companies, inventors, hand-made leather goods producers, owners of small inns, wineries, print shops, and manufacturers. Yet in some important ways, their stories sound the same. If our member companies were here today, they would tell you that data-intensive digital platforms and marketplaces - including Google, Facebook, and Amazon as well as Etsy, eBay, Yelp, Pinterest, TripAdvisor, Walmart.com, Houzz, QuickBooks and many more - benefit their businesses, help them compete, and accelerate their success.</p><p>Digital technology, digital platforms, and digital tools help small businesses start, grow and succeed in previously unimaginable ways - not only locally but way beyond traditional geographic limitations. Digital advertising and online marketing help small companies find new customers - globally and cost-efficiently. Data helps small businesses serve more customers at a lower cost. The digital cloud helps small businesses reduce paperwork, reduce their environmental footprint, and go on vacation while remaining available to colleagues and customers. Digital marketplaces help small businesses sell more products locally and globally.</p><p>* A 3C member in Iowa invented a retractable fabric gate to keep toddlers safe, and another member in Utah invented an all-in-one bedding set that makes it easy for kids (and adults) to make their bed every morning. As a startup, breaking into traditional retail and competing against global giants is almost impossible, so these entrepreneurs built simple websites and used Facebook posts and Google advertisements to find their first customers. Years later, digital marketing and data science still drive their growth and success. These companies employ dozens of people and has customers worldwide.</p><p>* A Columbus, Ohio print shop and an Arizona sports accessories retailer offer thousands of products in their online stores and compete against industry giants. Two decades ago, they would have been local shops with local customers; today they are small and global simultaneously.</p><p>* Several 3C members manage family-owned restaurants. They work with Yelp, Google, TripAdvisor, and Facebook to attract customers, manage their reputations and share specials and coupons, and they receive almost immediate feedback on whether their efforts are effective. Without digital platforms and tools, these restaurants would struggle to compete against big chain restaurants.</p><p>These are not simply feel-good stories or digital innovation stories. They relate directly to this hearing and the policy issues this Committee and others are considering because, in so many respects, the digital platforms and tools powering small businesses are provided by some of the world's largest companies, and several of those companies are being criticized and investigated.</p><p>Through the course of history, disruptive innovation has challenged incumbent industries. The combustion engine challenged horse-drawn carriages, the airplane challenged passenger and freight trains, and digital music challenged traditional record companies. Fortunately, policymakers in those times carefully scrutinized the complaints of then-powerful economic incumbents, and the inventions that once caused angst and turbulence were not over-regulated out of existence, and are now accepted as status quo.</p><p>With respect to this hearing and many of the digital economy investigations, 3C's concern is that policymakers, competition regulators, thought leaders and headline writers are focusing only on the largest companies, the loudest voices, and assertions of negative impacts or challenges when considering how to regulate the digital economy. It is so easy to say \"big is bad,\" to hear the wailing laments of incumbent businesses and industries, and to take for granted the opportunity and access to opportunity that deserves celebration and protection.</p><p>3C is also concerned that policymakers too often talk about small businesses rather than listen to them. For example, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission held several hearings about the digital economy and whether antitrust law should be reconsidered, and not a single small business or small business organization was invited to testify. 3C and our members thank Chairwoman Velasquez and Representative Chabot for sending a letter to the FTC calling attention to that glaring oversight.</p><p>The challenge of every small business is unique but their stories are universal. Unleashing the potential of American small business now requires access to affordable, secure, and scalable broadband and digital tools. It also requires policymakers to understand that the digital economy is a different type of interconnected and interdependent economy where the investment of global platforms have direct, tangible local benefits, and the value of access to digital tools is measured in new employees and increased financial security.</p><p>As I noted earlier, there are many more digital platforms than the Big Three or Big Four that so many people think about - Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. QuickBooks supports home-based entrepreneurs and small businesses. John Deere's Precision Agriculture solutions work wonders for small farmers. Pinterest and Houzz support and promote home decoration and renovation products, designers and contractors. These companies collect, aggregate and analyze vast quantities of data - safely, securely and affordably - and deliver the power of data science to small businesses that could not do this or afford this in virtually any other way.</p><p>The idea that regulators and policymakers are gleefully investigating free and low-cost services that power small business success mystifies 3C members. Just last week a longtime Google critic pointed out that the government investigation targets are not \"Big Tech,\" but rather are those companies whose business model is to provide \"purportedly free services in exchange for massive and unconstrained collection of consumer data untethered to the underlying service.\" Perhaps this critic does not recall the days of \"free\" broadcast television and broadcast radio, when large companies paid writers, directors, news reporters and actors billions of dollars to create \"free programming\" that was really just an advertising platform in disguise. Or free and low-cost newspapers that gave away information about City Hall and town meetings as subterfuge to sell advertisements. And should we investigate grocery stores? Are they massive corporate conglomerates providing us with discount fruits and vegetables as a ruse to sell shelf space and endcaps? Are they offering loyalty cards and gasoline discounts as a scheme to collect our data to sell coupons and in-store advertising?</p><p>For decades inventors and entrepreneurs have struggled to get new products into traditional retail stores. Sophisticated corporate buyers now demand up-front payments for in-store sampling stations and upend the traditional wholesale model by refusing to pay for products until they are purchased by consumers. These \"free experiences\" that are offered to consumers - like malls and department stores - have become data-driven multi-sided markets that mercilessly exploit retail tenants, food and health care companies and especially the entrepreneurs who rent kiosks to launch a new business.</p><p>Let's take a moment to dig more into the retail industry. It was only a few years ago when Federated was buying Marshall Field, Macy's, Hecht and many more local anchor retail chains, and then squeezing more discounts and imposing more burdens on local manufacturers - if they were even allowed to sell product in those stores. Amazon did not invent or even perfect private label products that compete against their suppliers. Private label products were invented in the 19th century by merchants who recognized that customers would welcome lower-cost high-quality alternatives. The Wishbone brand that we know for salad dressing started as a private label brand in a Springfield, IL grocery store owned by Jacob Bunn - the same Jacob Bunn who sold the Mary Todd brand of coffee and went on to manage the political campaign of his good friend, Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>Retail brands that we all know (though some have disappeared) started as private label sellers. In 1858 R.H. Macy opened its first department store, and in its first century it produced and sold more than 4000 private-label branded products - hoop skirts, wrapping paper, sewing machines - the list is endless. Today Macy's still sells hundreds of high-quality competitively-priced private label products.</p><p>Other stores took a different route. AandP established a retail presence and then created \"Eight O'Clock Breakfast Coffee.\" Sears built a retail presence and then, in 1927, created Craftsman tools. I am sure that independent tool manufacturers were unhappy that a large customer was now competing with them, but did they run to Congress and Attorneys General for relief, or did they instead build their brands and adjust their pricing strategies?</p><p>Certainly, Amazon is not the first retailer, or even the first large retailer, to build a private label business on the foundation of in-store data. CVS, Walgreen's and every grocery chain in America got there first.</p><p>Fortunately for inventors and small manufacturers, Amazon has unlimited shelf space and small companies can advertise and market independently to drive customers to their Amazon product page, or to their product page on Etsy, eBay, Walmart.com, or their own website. With Amazon and other e-commerce partners, entrepreneurs can test market new products, prices, colors, and features without ever building or shipping a product and without begging or paying off a corporate retail buyer for shelf space.</p><p>It is indisputable that large digital platforms, services, and marketplaces provide small businesses with affordable, scalable and secure business solutions. What is not equally understood is that these solutions are affordable, scalable, and secure because of the platforms' relative size. It is because of their size and scale that platforms have the capital to invest and the flexibility to price so that small businesses have a pathway to viability, growth, and success. Without the large platforms, these services would not exist or would not be affordable to 3C member small businesses.</p><p>We are living in an extraordinary era for entrepreneurs and small businesses. When new products, marketing campaigns, and advertising creative can be tested online for less than $100, there is virtually no barrier to starting a business or introducing a new product. But if the large digital platforms are broken up and each business unit would need to be individually profitable or pay the other business units for data or data solutions, there would be significantly fewer free or low- cost tools and services available to small businesses, prices would increase and effectiveness would diminish. That would reduce small business formation; undermine small business innovation; and hurt families in nationwide.</p><p>It is also notable that large digital companies compete aggressively against each other. Some 3C members spend more money on Facebook and Instagram; others think Google is a better partner; and still, others focus on Amazon and Pinterest. Moreover, new competitors are entering the market every day and driving innovation. Each of the platforms is investing in new and better small business offerings, and small businesses and their hometowns benefit.</p><p>A common theme of 3C companies - the power of technology and data - connects directly to today's hearing. Unleashing the potential of rural America requires unleashing the potential of digital tools, access to data, and the power of data science for rural America. For many years, policymakers and thought leaders have discussed the digital divide as a broadband access issue and focused attention on how underserved communities would benefit from inexpensive access to broadband. These are legitimate concerns, but 3C's focus is the next question: once broadband and digital tools are available, how can small businesses maximize the opportunity?</p><p>The reality of the digital economy is that our members - and nearly 30 million small businesses like them - stand on the shoulders of large companies to reach otherwise unattainable heights. Platforms invest in scalable, secure, and affordable tools. Marketplaces connect buyers with sellers. Small businesses leverage these tools and marketplaces to start, build, and grow. The guiding principles of the digital economy - speed and scale - consistently drive shared value and mutual benefit for small businesses. Innovative technologies and approaches are widely available, easily adopted, and improved quickly. Our public officials must take great care to ensure that policies focused on the largest digital companies do not inadvertently undermine small business opportunity.</p><p>It is impossible to overstate the billions of dollars in small business value and the millions of small business jobs supported by some of America's largest digital companies, including eBay, Etsy, Amazon, Square, Intuit, FreshBooks, Google, Constant Contact and Facebook. Some of these companies are much larger than others, but all provide extraordinary and low-cost platforms and tools to small businesses. This committee, other federal policymakers, and competition regulators must not overlook this.</p><p>We cannot afford to lose the forest through the trees, focusing our attention on only the largest and more prominent companies and issues. Rather, we should try to take the perspective of a small business, seeing the full landscape as we consider who will ultimately pay the price if business models are dramatically changed, costly regulations are enacted, or access to essential tools is limited.</p><p>On behalf of the tens of millions of digitally-empowered American small businesses, thank you for welcoming 3C today. We look forward to working with you and your colleagues to lower technological barriers to small business success, to strengthen competition and to continue promoting small business opportunity.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://smallbusiness.house.gov/uploadedfiles/11-14-19_mr._ward_testimony.pdf\">https://smallbusiness.house.gov/uploadedfiles/11-14-19_mr._ward_testimony.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHCB14982S7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSR-PGG1-DYVR-P1WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 14, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp;

Thank you for inviting me today to talk about large technology companies' impact on small business. I am Joe Kennedy, Senior Fellow with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF). ITIF is the world's leading think tank for science and technology policy and focuses on developing better policy to promote innovation, increase competitiveness, and improve productivity. In my capacity at ITIF I have written on Internet platforms, antitrust, the gig economy, and other issues. n1</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The small businessperson has long played an iconic role in American society, symbolizing independence, fortitude, and diligence. However, both the challenges and opportunities facing small businesses have grown in an increasingly global economy with a ubiquitous Internet that lets consumers quickly compare prices, find reviews, and shop online. On the whole, Internet platforms play a positive role in helping businesses of all sizes deal with these changes. More importantly, by delivering efficiencies and increasing competition, they benefit consumers by lowering prices, leaving them with more money to spend on other goods and services.</p><p>In cases where large technology platforms compete fairly with small businesses and gain market share, this is something that policymakers should welcome, not oppose, for by definition such results boost consumer welfare and economic growth. However, when the conduct of large technology companies, particularly technology platforms, raises legitimate antitrust issues, these problems can be adequately addressed by applying existing laws. We should not enact new, restrictive laws or engage in new antitrust practices simply to rein in some of America's most productive companies. Nor should we try the Herculean task of trying to break them up. Both would come with the consequence of less innovation, productivity, and consumer welfare.</p><p>Most large technology companies, including Internet platforms, give business owners tools they need to succeed. The most challenging aspect of any new business involves finding customers, establishing a reputation, and setting up the fixed costs involved in running a business. These latter include accounting, computer systems, human resources, and complying with the many federal, state, and local regulations. Platforms help small companies with all of this in the following ways:</p><p>* Internet platforms allow any business to set up a website, Facebook page, Instagram account, YouTube channel and other online presences to reach customers, exchange information, and build a loyal customer base. Prior to these platforms, most small businesses were limited to local media, which was geographically limited, comparatively expensive, and did not provide any feedback about effectiveness. n2</p><p>* Firms such as PayPal and Square make it easier to handle payments, greatly reducing the risk of nonpayment and fraud, and integrate directly with various accounting software systems, reducing administrative overhead.</p><p>* Platforms such as TaskRabbit and Thumbtack match businesses with customers, saving them some of the time and effort involved in advertising. They also help small companies find workers to deal with sudden increases in volume.</p><p>* Rating systems on sites such as eBay and Yelp help companies build reputations for excellence and provide transparency in markets.</p><p>* Cloud services from Amazon, Dropbox, Microsoft and other companies provide easily scalable computer capacity at low cost. These services also offer best-in-class security features, allowing small businesses to protect consumers' information from hackers and reduce downtime and lost business from technical problems.</p><p>* Internet platforms allow even the smallest company to targeted advertising to those most likely to be interested in its products, which makes effective marketing more affordable for small companies.</p><p>* Finally, marketplaces, such as Amazon, eBay, and Etsy, give even the smallest companies the ability to sell online to consumers across the world. They also handle logistics and delivery, saving the company from having to perform these services itself and allowing it to concentrate on customer service and the quality of its products.</p><p>Online platforms therefore significantly reduce the costs of market entry for businesses and enable entirely new business models. n3 This success depends on their flexibility to design rules and terms of service that maximize their value to consumers and producers.</p><p>Many of the most important battles in the technology industry do not involve small business. Whatever the merits of Spotify's antitrust suit against Apple, the dispute involves two large and highly successful firms that can look out for themselves. But it is also important to acknowledge that some Internet companies compete with small business. This is neither new nor disturbing. With the growth in national and now global markets, the optimal size of businesses in many industries has grown. As ITIF President Robert Atkinson and Michael Lind point out, with growing markets, large companies are often more efficient than their competitors. n4 In competitive markets, the lion's share of the benefit from efficiency is passed on to consumers. The effect of enhanced competition can reduce the market share of smaller, less efficient rivals. Where this displacement is the effect of legitimate competition, public policy should encourage it, or at minimum not hinder it. The purpose of antitrust policy should be to enhance consumer welfare and ensure that businesses do not engage in anticompetitive conduct. It should not be to protect companies from the legitimate effects of competition.</p><p>One aspect of competition occurs when companies that operate a platform also offer their own products over that platform. The fear is that the platform owner will compete with the most profitable products offered by others. Some commentators have expressed concern that this would allow for unfair competition. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has proposed prohibiting platform owners from competing with companies that use their platform. n5</p><p>But once again, these practices are neither strange nor new. Walmart, Safeway, and CVS, for example, all offer shelf space to thousands of brands. In many cases they use in-store analytics to identify what products they should sell under their own brand, competing with the brands they already sell. For example, Costco's Kirkland brand directly competes with those of their suppliers. These products appear side-by-side with their competitors and are often priced lower. Yet few people argue Safeway should be broken up or that Costco should divest itself of its Kirkland products, for the simple reason that these practices are valued by consumers.</p><p>In a widely cited article, antitrust attorney Lina Khan criticized Amazon for competing with Quidsi, an online company that sold baby products, by lowing its prices on diapers and other baby products. n6 She alleges Amazon lowered its prices by 30 percent in order to force Quidsi out of business. While lower prices might have hurt Quidsi, they clearly benefited consumers, at least in the short run. In a deal reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission, Amazon eventually purchased Quidsi in 2011. Yet Amazon continued to face strong competition from other suppliers including Pampers and Huggies as well as marketplaces such as getdyper.com and boxed.com, and of course other major retailers that sold online and offline.</p><p>The Quidsi case is worth examining in some detail. Khan basically alleges that Amazon sold diapers at a loss in order to encroach on Quidsi's business. She may be right about the pricing but wrong about the intended target. As Kristian Stout and Alec Stapp of the International Center for Law and Economics relate, Quidsi's founders also sold diapers below costs. n7 Why? Because they saw Walmart and Target using diapers as a loss leader in order to build a relationship with new mothers who hopefully would then purchase a lot more from the store.</p><p>It might look like Amazon eventually won the battle when it was able to purchase Quidsi for $545 million. But even after this purchase it faced strong competition that limited its ability to raise prices. According to Khan, in 2016 Amazon had 43 percent of online diaper sales, while Walmart and Target had 23 percent and 18 percent respectively. Signficantly more sales were made off-line. But the story does not end there. As Jeff Eisenach of the American Enterprise Institute points out, in April, 2017 Amazon shut down Quidsi, including Diapers.com. Meanwhile the founders of Quidsi used the proceeds from the sale to create another online retail company, Jet.com, which Walmart purchased for $3.3 billion. In one of the most often cited examples of unfair competition, it is difficult to see any harm to either consumers or the founders of the target company. Meanwhile Amazon suffered large losses on both its sale of diapers and its acquisition of Quidsi.</p><p>In the vast majority of cases, however, the interests of a platform coincide with those of the businesses that sell over it: to increase sales. The more a given business sells to customers, the more the platform realizes in commissions. Thus platforms have an incentive to help small businesses reach new customers and increase their sales. This is the same practice as in grocery stores, which take a markup on the products they sell and, by offering a wide variety, attract more customers. Customers are better off with a few large marketplaces competing vigorously than with many smaller less efficient shops offering limited selections.</p><p>Another issue arises when platforms have access to extensive information about customers and suppliers. The fear here is that they will either use it to compete against suppliers or, by denying it to sellers, they will limit their ability to grow. Again, supermarkets offer a good guide. Walmart, Costco and other big supermarkets collect lots of data about the performance of both their own brands and those of others. But we do not regulate whether they should share this information with suppliers like Proctor and Gamble. Some stores may want to share consumer information in order to attract more suppliers, which in turn will attract consumers. Other stores may want to build a reputation for protecting consumers' privacy by not sharing data. This might attract more consumers and therefore more suppliers. In each case the store has a strong incentive to attract and keep participants on both sides of the market. n8</p><p>The same dynamic operates when it comes to bundling services. Any seller of a hardware or software product faces a decision of how much to include in the offering. But this is not new. Automobile companies have long bundled features like radios in new cars. While this might have hurt particular sellers of car radios, it clearly benefited consumers who wanted to be able to buy a car with the radio already installed. We see the same dynamic in the digital era. For example, initially Microsoft Word did not come with an integrated spell checker. Consumers had to buy one separately and install it. But it became clear that spell check was an integral component of any word processing program and so Microsoft, Apple and other providers of word processing systems bundled them into the initial offering.</p><p>More recently we see companies bundling offerings in smart phones. For example, once Apple realized that consumers valued a flashlight app in the iPhone, it decided to include it when they are sold, in part because makers of many phones using the Android operating system were doing the same thing. This may have hurt a small app developer that might otherwise offer a similar app. Despite this, the market is resilient enough that iPhone users can still use the Apple store to download a number of other flashlight apps for free. In addition, Apple's store offers an instant market to millions of other app developers. Antitrust policy is meant to promote competition and encourage productivity, not to protect the interests of existing suppliers, be they large or small.</p><p>Internet marketplaces benefit consumers in other ways. By reducing the cost of communication and record keeping large technology firms also likely increase the optimal size of many businesses. This puts pressure on small companies to grow enough to achieve the efficiencies that new technology offers. However, platforms give these companies the option of putting some of these burdens onto platforms, effectively outsourcing and turning them into variable costs.</p><p>This move toward efficiency largely benefits consumers, who after all are the primary intended beneficiaries of antitrust policy. Large companies often have lower marginal costs from economies of scale, and therefore lower prices. Buyers often prefer large marketplaces that offer a broad selection. But in order to offer a wide selection, platforms need to be large and deal with many suppliers. Although businesses must pay Walmart and Amazon a share of their revenue in order to access these platforms, they obtain access to a large number of buyers without having to duplicate the platform's infrastructure.</p><p>As a filing by ITIF's affiliate the Center for Data Innovation recently concluded:</p><p>While the kind of competition platforms enable is unique, many of their other economic characteristics--such as catering to two sided markets, the fact other businesses rely on platforms as routes to market, the fact platforms often compete with those same businesses, and the fact platforms control large quantities of valuable data, occur in various sectors, as the above comments illustrate.</p><p>It is for these reasons, as well as the great diversity of platforms' business models, that broad regulations on platform-to-business relations would be ill-advised, because they risk imposing restrictions on business models they are not suited to, which would stifle competition and innovation at the expense of consumers. Policymakers should apply the tools they already have at their disposal for promoting fairness and enforcing the law, and limit regulatory interventions to specific, clearly-defined sectors where they will work as intended, without creating harmful distortions. n9</p><p>Still, some regulators are concerned that platforms may have too much power over smaller companies. A report by the European Commission worried that:</p><p>Where business models of entire ecosystems of [small and medium enterprises] are dependent on access to a small number of online platforms, or where platforms have access to datasets of unprecedented size, new asymmetries may be created. In such situations, some suppliers to platforms can be disproportionately exposed to potentially unfair trading practices, even in the absence of established dominance of a platform. n10</p><p>Fears about market dominance have led to several unwise policy recommendations. I would like to briefly explain why this is so. First, a number of commentators recommend breaking up the largest Internet companies. Rather than refer to any concrete harm to consumers, these advocates concentrate on the alleged dangers that large companies pose not only to small business, but to our political and social systems. n11 Yet breaking up companies is extremely difficult; it takes years and seldom leads to better market performance. n12 It is also doubtful that courts would approve such drastic moves. Moreover, doing so would almost surely reduce innovation, productivity and consumer welfare. For example, it is hard to not believe that breaking up Amazon into its regular website and Amazon Marketplace would harm consumers, who would then have to go to two separate websites to shop for the same item, thus reducing competition and choice.</p><p>Others advocate for legislation that would dictate specific rules for how platforms operate, such as search fairness, data collection or sharing, and removal from the platform. While platforms should publish clear rules and enforce them evenly, dictating the specifics of those rules would harm the market. Each platform already has a strong incentive to satisfy both buyers and sellers. Platforms often differ on how to do this, but the competition between platforms benefits users. For example, some platforms resist sharing data about their search algorithms because they do not want suppliers to game the system. Government officials, lobbied by companies on one side or another, are unlikely to find the best solutions. Moreover, existing antitrust laws already limit truly unfair trade practices.</p><p>Extensive limits on data collection and use are also unwise and would hurt small businesses. Consumer data is often helpful in increasing both sales and customer satisfaction. Although much of this data is available from other sources or has a limited shelf life, small businesses are often the least able to get access to it. Where platforms decide to use this data to help suppliers find potential customers, the government should allow it, subject to reasonable privacy rules.</p><p>Advocates also complain that, because many platforms get to see what people are looking for, they have an unfair advantage. This is most often expressed about Amazon, which sometimes competes against other companies by offering its own products. But again, large bricks and mortar retailers also get to see what people are buying, and they can and do use this to identify products to sell. Overall, this kind of competition benefits consumers. Again, the law should not protect companies, even ones with a nice story to tell, from the effects of legitimate competition.</p><p>Finally, some foreign countries allege that platforms are not paying their fair share of taxes. France recently responded by enacting a Digital Services Tax narrowly focused on the largest U.S. Internet companies. But recent studies show digital companies often face a higher marginal tax burden than large companies in other industries. n13 Moreover, the French Digital Service Tax clearly violates its trade agreements with other countries. It also violates the spirit of existing bilateral tax treaties. n14</p><p>So what can policymakers do to strengthen the relationship between Internet companies and small business? One solution is to enhance rules governing fairness and transparency. Platforms should publish their rules for dealing with both buyers and sellers and should apply those rules in a transparent, even-handed manner. A recent example is the United Kingdom's open banking initiative and the European Union's second Payment Services Directive, which will boost competition in financial services by allowing banking consumers to share their data with third party service providers using open application programming interfaces developed by industry. But the scope for doing this is likely to be limited because multi-sided platforms already have a strong incentive to cater to the needs of each side of the market. Perceived unfairness to suppliers not only drives them away, it also makes the platform less attractive to buyers, who now have access to fewer sellers.</p><p>Second, regulators can look for barriers to entry, whether natural or artificial, and try to remove them, thus encouraging more platforms to enter the market to serve the diverse needs of small businesses and their customers, both current and potential. Determining the best ways to add value is difficult and often subject to failure, but the general goal of offering services that allow business owners to devote more effort to improving their products and customer service remains an important market opportunity.</p><p>Finally, in some cases a limited number of firms outside the technology industry have created an exclusive access to particular datasets that they use to exploit market power. Examples are the Multiple Listing Services in real estate, bank restrictions on financial data aggregators that show customers how to reduce fees, and flight availability and pricing in the airline industry. Some health care providers, and their technology providers, have also been found to be blocking legitimate access to patient data to protect their own economic interests. n15 In each case companies are blocking consumer data without a legitimate business purpose. Regulators should require them to make the data widely available so that consumers can benefit from enhanced competition. n16</p><p>A particular platform may remain successful for a prolonged period if it successfully adapts to new technology and business models. But this is unlikely to systemically harm small businesses who have a number of potential routes to their customers. Platforms already compete for their business and shutting off access would threaten the main source of revenue for many platforms: selling ads targeted at the consumers that visit their sites or encouraging consumers to buy their own products. And again, if such a market position is abused, existing antitrust remedies are adequate to restore competition. For example, if a platform applied stricter criteria or higher fees to products that compete with its own or arbitrarily sold one company sales data about its rivals, we believe existing authority would allow regulators to challenge it.</p><p>I am happy to answer any questions you have.</p><p>n1.

Almost 10 years ago I founded a toy company named Viahart. We have 4 full time employees and we sold about $4 million dollars of product on Amazon last year and should sell about $5 million dollars on Amazon this year. I speak Chinese, I know manufacturing, logistics, and e-commerce. And with regards to Big Tech, Amazon is my area of expertise. With my testimony, I am going to give you a bird's eye view of what it's like to operate as a small business in Amazon's orbit as well as answer the questions posed by the hearing summary. I will also submit detailed documents for the record that describe issues small businesses and consumers face on Amazon, what government can do about it, and whether they should.</p><p>To the question \"Has Amazon created business solutions that have enabled small businesses to reach and serve new customers?\" - The answer to that question is \"Yes, absolutely.\" Their Fulfillment by Amazon program solved logistical issues for small businesses that previously would've required big investments or big headaches. This has enabled small businesses to offer less expensive and innovative products more easily to American consumers. Everyone, perhaps with the exception of brick-and-mortar retailers, has won: Amazon, small businesses, and consumers. As a result, Amazon owns e-commerce. We can talk statistics, but just trust me; for most categories, such as books, toys, electronics, home goods, and gifts etc., basically everything but cars, food, gasoline, luxury, and convenience, Amazon is dominant. In 2018, despite selling on eBay, Walmart.com, our own website, and brick and mortar stores, Amazon accounted for 98% of our revenue. So, \"Do small businesses like ours rely on Amazon?\" Yes, completely. When they say \"jump\", we say \"how high\" - if Amazon suspends us from the platform, we go bust, and we go bust fast. In 2018, we paid $2 million dollars to Amazon and Amazon's expenses as a share of our revenue on Amazon have gone from 33% in 2013 to 50% in 2018. That said, we've been profitable and our sales have grown 37% every year over that period. So \"Do small businesses have an opportunity to compete in the information age?\" It is not easy and we work very hard, but we, as a small business, have done all right. So, yes, we do have an opportunity to compete amongst \"Big Tech\"...but, is the playing field fair? The answer to that is like a Facebook relationship status - \"it's complicated\". If we compete against Amazon, we operate at a massive disadvantage, but provided they don't engage in underhanded tactics, that's okay. It's capitalist competition. If Amazon Basics knocks off one of our products, provided they didn't commit IP infringement, it's unfortunate, but it's okay. On balance, while they certainly make their fair share of mistakes, which I describe in my additional submission for the record, and while they sometimes focus on what's legal rather than what's ethical, they are a good company. They're also an engine for innovation. As such, we, as a nation, should take great care in legislating or regulating this giant, but also fast moving and innovative company. Like in the hippocratic oath, we should \"first, do no harm\". In keeping the metaphor, it is said that sunshine is the best disinfectant. By shining light on the issues, we can compel Amazon to do a better job in addressing them. Since selling on the platform, I have seen them make great strides towards improving their marketplace for honest sellers and consumers. While I do think there are some areas where legislation and regulation is appropriate, in general, here, the threat of it is stronger than its execution. We can do better for American consumers, American small businesses, and the entire United States by proceeding with caution and introducing narrow legislation that addresses the nagging problems on the platform. My additional submission for the record not only describes these problems in detail, but also suggests legislative solutions that can win bipartisan support and better America for all stakeholders.</p><p>So let's do it. And let's do it now.</p><p>We have a unique opportunity in time to improve our country by doing so and I look forward to working with you to make it happen.</p><p>Thank you for this opportunity and I welcome your questions.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://smallbusiness.house.gov/uploadedfiles/11-14-19_mr._hart_testimony.pdf\">https://smallbusiness.house.gov/uploadedfiles/11-14-19_mr._hart_testimony.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHCB14979S4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSR-PGG1-DYVR-P1WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 14, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is the key to personal and business resilience in a world of unending disruption -- and a game-changing opportunity for unprecedented economic inclusion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Full Testimony</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I am the CEO of Cintrifuse, an organization committed to building a leading innovation economy in Greater Cincinnati. We provide services to hundreds of entrepreneurs and manage a 38,000 sq ft co-working space in Cincinnati's urban core. We also unlock innovation through $115 million in invested capital from corporations such as PandG, Kroger, Western and Southern, and EW Scripps. As for me, I've launched and sold a tech startup and recently served as Global Head of Digital for Nestle.</p><p>I have just one core message that I'd like to share with you today: the best way to help small business owners thrive in this uncertain world is to help them think and act like startups -- the entrepreneurs who are disrupting every part of our economy and, in the process, creating new jobs, game-changing technologies, and new, better ways to live and work.</p><p>When I say startups, I don't necessarily mean Silicon Valley. Or Ivy League entrepreneurs raising millions in venture capital. I'm referring to the new generation of entrepreneurs taking on big, unsolved problems... in every sector of our society ... and turning them on their head.</p><p>Many of these startup founders are women and minorities. And they're coming from well beyond the East and West Coasts; a huge number are stepping up throughout the Midwest.</p><p>They are harnessing digital technology, connectivity, and \"distributed everything\" to create new business models, new solutions, and new companies designed for the age of disruption.</p><p>Which is a point I want to underscore: we ARE living in an age of unending disruption - in which economic, social, health-related shocks -- are going to become more common.</p><p>Some people call this a VUCA world -- volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. A VUCA world requires VUCA leadership - precisely what a startup mindset enables.</p><p>To be clear, there are urgent needs that small business owners need help with right now. Paycheck protection. Access to capital. Streamlined regulations and policies. They're all critical and necessary. But we must also look beyond the present to a future that is going to be even more demanding than the moment we're living in today. And do so with urgency!</p><p>Many people talk about re-skilling - or even UP-skilling -- as a way to prepare for the new economy. Neither is enough! We also need STARTUP-SKILLING -- teaching and empowering small business owners to think and act like startups in times of crisis AND in times of growth.</p><p>What does this mean? A startup mindset is different than a conventional leadership mindset. It prizes speed, rapid prototyping, constant iteration, and failing fast to learn fast. It is obsessed with data, what to see in it, and how to exploit it. It's digital, and it thrives on pivots.</p><p>STARTUP-SKILLING should become a national priority -- led by the SBA and involving corporations, universities and startup ecosystems. The Kaufmann Foundation has called for the creation of an \"e-Corps\" -- a Peace Corps of sorts for digital natives. I love that idea, but let's focus it disproportionally on STARTUP-SKILLING for small businesses. And get it going NOW.</p><p>What does STARTUP-SKILLING look like?</p><p>First, it's about showing small business owners how they can apply startup thinking, technologies and practices to their own ventures.</p><p>For example, at Cintrifuse we hosted a program called Nitro! in partnership with JP Morgan Chase. Over ONE weekend, we \"startup-skilled\" several dozen minority-led businesses -- entrepreneurs who are vastly under-served and under-resourced throughout every community. We gave them access to mentors. We showed them how to leverage technology. We brought in Google. We taught them the principles of startup leadership.</p><p>This should be a signature SBA program. We need thousands of NITRO! Weekends across America. Every weekend!! Not just to support small business owners, but to turbocharge our support for minority and women-led small businesses in particular! We also need to support other existing efforts like Mortar, the minority-focused startup accelerator you heard last year.</p><p>We're also seeing movement in \"micro-credentialing\" aimed at urban and rural areas. Miami University in Ohio is one such school developing more accessible micro-credentialing targeted at starting a new enterprise and including basic skills in accounting, finance, and marketing. Faculty are deployed well beyond the Ivory Tower to the actual communities in need.</p><p>Second, it's about learning from Digital Natives -- the kids who've grown up being digital. With sponsorship from our corporate partners, Cintrifuse is sponsoring a \"virtual entrepreneurial program\" for high school and college students -- as we speak, in fact!</p><p>We targeted 50 students. We got 100. They're developing startup ideas to help address pressing challenges created by Covid, by Sustainability, and by Social Justice issues. We're challenging them to explore ways in which radically more transparent supply chains - driven by breakthrough innovations in areas like traceability - might be part of a better future.</p><p>In other words, they're taking on big unsolved problems. And they're thinking beyond big companies and tech startups to the role small businesses can play in our own back yard.</p><p>Third, it's about \"mobilizing\" and \"re-platforming\" small business services.</p><p>I spent hours before this testimony reviewing dozens of government and SBA digital properties, apps, and more. I've applied for PPP help. I've read web comments. I'm convinced the SBA needs a digital startup infusion.</p><p>Why not build an \"open innovation\" platform to crowd-source solutions? And why not take greater advantage of audience-rich \"big tech\" - Google, Microsoft, Amazon. Facebook, for example, has more than three billion users including TENS OF MILLIONS of small business owners. This platform is taking heat for reasons I'll refrain from discussing, but why not invite them to co-develop a next generation hub for small business services and startup-skilling. Not a page or an ad campaign, but SBA.com on steroids. What a win-win!</p><p>Final observation: I truly believe there's little distinction between a tech startup and a mom and pop small business. They are both based on an idea, a problem that needs to be solved, an entrepreneurial spirit, and the desire to take a shot and carve your own path. Whether we're talking about scalable technology or small-town service, we're talking about the same thing: businesses built on the ingenuity, passion and persistence of people who simply want to make our country better by finding a better way. That's American entrepreneurialism.</p><p>We have a \"pivot moment\" to both support small businesses in crisis AND to accelerate their ability to think and act like the startups that are changing the world.</p><p>My bumper-sticker? Let's STARTUP-SKILL America!!</p><p>If we meet this moment, we will inspire, grow and unleash the most diverse, innovative and resilient generation of entrepreneurs in American history. Thank you.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://smallbusiness.house.gov/uploadedfiles/07-15-20_mr._blackshaw_testimony.pdf\">https://smallbusiness.house.gov/uploadedfiles/07-15-20_mr._blackshaw_testimony.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHC71501433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C9-KSW1-JCCP-04TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1273\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 15, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

And I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for joining us today. I would like to start by thanking all our witnesses for coming to the table today to participate in this hearing including those that travelled. And in particular, I want to thank Amazon and Google for deciding to appear today. I know that this was not an easy decision for your company but I believe it was the right one.  </p><p>As everyone can see, we also have two empty chairs to demonstrate the failure of Facebook and Apple. Companies that somehow find the means to spend millions on lobbying and hire dozens of executives to find the time to be here today. Their failure to appear not only impedes Congress mission but also speaks volumes about the company's commitment to transparency and their very own customers.  </p><p>So, yes, thank you Amazon and Google for being here today, and to Facebook and Apple, you reap what you sow. It is important that everyone in the room understands that this committee has a tradition of being fair and that will continue during this hearing.  </p><p>Earlier this year, we held a hearing on how the digital ecosystem promotes entrepreneurship. And last year, we held an Amazon roundtable on prime day. Both events showcase the benefits that tech platforms provide small businesses.  </p><p>Today, we will now look at this through another lens. Yes, it is true that innovation and ingenuity built this country. In fact, we could--one could argue that these qualities are uniquely American and have propelled our nation to produce the most successful companies and the foremost technologies. And I know that the companies we have on this panel and the ones we don't start it as an idea in a basement or a college dorm room, and that entrepreneurship, the spirit that built your companies is to be commended.  </p><p>That being said the grip that big tech now holds over our daily lives and our competitive landscape at the same time is astounding but also concerning. Big tech platforms dominate search functions, the devices used by nearly every American, online advertising and online messaging platforms, they are market leaders in cloud computing services to businesses and consumers while also providing entertainment and other digital streaming services.  </p><p>Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook are collectively worth over $4.3 trillion. Those five companies comprise over 15 percent of the total value of the S&amp;P 500 which tracks the market value of the 500 largest companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. To provide a little more context on the scope and reach of these companies, Amazon currently has approximately 50 percent of the U.S. ecommerce retail market. Nearly 90 percent of internet searches go through Google and its subsidiary YouTube while Facebook put in $55 billion in ad revenue last year and apple sold over 217 million iPhones in 2018 alone.  </p><p>The sheer size of this company along with pervasive integration of these platforms and concentration of power influencing online traffic raises questions that should concern anyone who cares about market access, data privacy, small business development, entrepreneurship and innovation. And one only has to look to the decline in American start-ups to connect the dots.  </p><p>In 2006, 558,000 businesses were formed but the census reported that only 414,000 businesses were studied in 2015. And there is growing anxiety not only in the U.S. but around the world that the large tech companies pose a threat to innovation and competition. When consolidation takes place in any industry, a market power is increased as it has in the tech industry. It is simply too hard for new businesses to get off the ground. Many of the popular products and features of these companies have not been developed internally. They have occurred through merger and acquisition with the largest being Microsoft pain over $26 billion for LinkedIn.  </p><p>Do we want a country of entrepreneurs and investors that dream of building something or dream of being bought by larger competitors? In my view we need to reboot this start-up economy. And when small businesses do get off the ground and are able to succeed, we need to ensure that they are treated fairly on online marketplaces and that consumers can find them on search engines.  </p><p>Small businesses need certainty and transparency when they are operating this--their businesses on digital platforms so that they can set competitive prices and still make enough money to continue to grow their businesses, create jobs, and invest in their communities. And when small firms do get into disputes with the powerful gatekeepers, they need a fair shot at resolving the problem so that they can continue to run their businesses.  </p><p>And finally, I think we need to be clear that in a digital marketplace that every firm and especially the big (INAUDIBLE) films here today are desperate for our data. Our data is an economic asset which garners more value as one collects more of it. The concentration of the data in fewer and fewer firms has implications for small businesses. The internet and digital platforms are so deeply woven into American lives that small firms cannot afford to be excluded and/or treated unfairly.  </p><p>Small businesses need to be protected by policies that offer them the certainty and transparency they need to make meaningful business decisions. As consumers continue to increase their engagement with businesses through digital platforms, small firms need to be sure that they can be found when new and existing customers are looking for their business. We cannot allow our economy to become one that stifles innovation or make it impossible for small firms to compete.  </p><p>I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to create meaningful policies that foster collaboration between small firms and digital platforms uninsured that small businesses have a fair opportunity to succeed. I now like to yield to the Ranking Member Mr. Chabot for his opening statement.  </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and thank you for the witnesses that are here today. We understand it's not always easy to answer when Congress calls but are glad that you've taken the time out of your busy schedules to speak with us today.  </p><p>The digital age has caused a revolution for small businesses. No more are small firms caught behind their larger counterparts when it comes to the availability of game-changing technologies to help grow and expand their businesses. Small firms can now utilize cutting-edge products and services to respond to market changes very swiftly. And there's--we--with the increasing adoption of mobile computing devices, cloud systems and online conference call technology like FaceTime, employees can collaborate effectively even across great distances and work almost anywhere.  </p><p>But perhaps, the greatest benefit is the financial savings that affords small businesses. Increases in productivity allow companies to do more, faster, and with less overhead. Not surprisingly, many of these digital platforms have been developed and marketed by large businesses such as our witnesses today from Amazon and Google. Have there been some concerns regarding privacy and intellectual property concerns? Of course, there have. But by and large the development of these digital platform products and services from these tech giants has been a boon for the millions of individual small businesses that would probably never have existed without them.  </p><p>We are the Small Business Committee here after all but we like all businesses as competition drives progress, growth, and economic expansion. Today's hearing is an opportunity for us to examine the symbiotic relationship between small firms and big businesses. Both need each other to continue our unprecedented economic expansion of the past three years. I think we're all looking forward to our discussion here this afternoon. Thank you, Madam Chair, for holding this hearing and I yield back.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Chabot. The gentleman yields back and if committee members have an opening statement, we will ask that they be submitted for the record. I would like to just take a minute to explain the timing rules. Each witness gets five minutes to testify, our members get five minutes for questioning. There is a lighting system to assist you. The green light comes on when you begin and a yellow light means there is one minute--minute remaining. The red light comes on when you are out of time and we ask that you stay within that time frame to the best of your ability.  </p><p>I would now like to introduce our witnesses on today's first panel. I will take a minute into--introduce each of you before turning over for testimony. Our first--first witness today is Mr. Dharmesh Mehta. Mr. Mehta is the president for Amazon customer trust and support--partner support team.  </p><p>The team is focused on creating a trustworthy shopping experience across Amazon stores worldwide by protecting customers brands selling, partners and Amazon from fraud and abuse and they're also focused on providing world-class support for Amazon selling partners. He joined Amazon in October 2013 and prior to joining Amazon, Mr. Mehta spent most of his career in the technology industry in a variety of product engineering and marketing leadership roles. Welcome, sir.  </p><p>Our second witness is America's--Miss Erica when--Swanson. Ms. Swanson currently serves as the head of community engaged--engagement for grow with Google which is a new U.S. initiative to help people grow their skills, careers, and businesses through free training tools and events. Previously, she served as head of community impact investments and programs at Google Fiber. She led the team responsible for developing and delivering a range of social impact investment and community engagement strategies in Google Fiber Cities. A key area of focus was partnering with local leaders to advance digital equity.  </p><p>Our third witness is Dr. Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at information technology and innovation foundation where he focuses on economic policy. For almost three decades, he has provided legal and economic advice to senior officials in the public and private sector. Much of this advice has been directed at public policies involving technology competitiveness and the social contract. Dr. Kennedy previously served as the chief economist for the U.S. Department of Commerce where he oversaw a taff--a staff of 15 economists and regularly briefed the secretary of commerce on economic issues including the financial crisis and immigration reform. Welcome home. Mr. Mehta, you are now recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>MEHTA: Thank you, Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Chabot and members of the committee. My name is Dharmesh Mehta and I'm the vice president of worldwide customer trust and partner support at Amazon. Amazon's mission is to be earth's most customer centric company.  </p><p>Our philosophy is simple; to work backwards from what customers want; convenience, selection and low prices, and to constantly innovate to make our store better for both our buying customers and our selling partners. Amazon lowers barriers to entry for entrepreneurs, we help make retail more vibrantly competitive and we delight customers with new innovations. In 1999, we decided to open our stores to small and medium businesses or SMBs to sell alongside us because we wanted to give customers greater selection that only third-party sellers could provide. And in 2006, we did the same with our logistics network and we invited SMBs to a new program called fulfilment by Amazon to give customers even faster delivery.  </p><p>With the partnership of small, medium, businesses, we now provide our customers with even more selection with faster delivery speeds. Our store model has worked well because empowering third-party selling has created a better customer experience than Amazon could otherwise provide on its own.  </p><p>Today, in the United States alone there are more than 1.9 million businesses content creators and developers that are using Amazon's products and services to realize their dreams and they are thriving. On average, they sell more than 4,000 items every minute. In 2018, there were over 25,000 entrepreneurs that surpassed $1 million in sales on Amazon.  </p><p>In addition, these entrepreneurs have used these sales and their businesses to create more than 830,000 jobs for Americans. When third parties first started selling on Amazon, they generated about $100 million in sales and were about 3 percent of our total sales. Since then, we've made substantial investments to help our selling partner succeed, and now SMBs, generate about a hundred and sixty billion dollars in sales and they represent 58 percent of the total value of physical products sold in our stores. And that's because third-party sellers are thriving and growing at almost twice as fast as Amazon's own retail business and we celebrate that growth and we expect that trend to continue.  </p><p>But numbers paying only part of the picture, every American small business has a story that tells much, much more and so I'd like to share one with the committee. Let me tell you about Tara Darnley from GreensboroNorth Carolina. She owns Darnley and company Tara and her husband Carl had an idea for a new product to help their baby get through teething. At the time, Tara didn't have a business background, she didn't have a college degree and her husband was working as a pastry chef.  </p><p>So they started to prototype devices and a few prototypes later, Darnley and company was in business with the Yummy Mitt. Their innovative teether became a big hit at trade shows and a few months later, the Yummy Mitt was on retail shelves. However, Tara says that listing the product on Amazon was the real game-changer. Tara not only sold on Amazon but she real I--relied on Amazon customer reviews and sales data to grow her business. She said that she had initially focused on marketing to moms but as she looked at the Amazon data, she realized that grandparents were an untapped target. And Tara says that their sales really jumped when they started marketing to grandparents.  </p><p>Darnley and company is now a global company. They sell 20 different baby products. Carl quit his day job. He now works for Tara every day and they have 10 employees running the business. There are thousands of stories just like this but I'd love to tell you if we had the time. We know that our selling partners have many ways to reach our customers and so our value proposition has to remain strong. That's the reason that this year we'll invest over $15 billion in infrastructure and tools and programs and employees that create programs to help our selling partner success.  </p><p>We have 7,000 employees building tools and features that help our selling partners run their business to set up their accounts, to list products, to manage their inventory and to grow their business. We have another 10,000 full-time employees that are dedicated to understanding, responding to and providing support to our selling partners, and our goal is to respond to and resolve every one of those contacts expeditiously. Last year, more than 80 percent of those selling partner issues were fully resolved in less than 24 hours.  </p><p>We also have 5000 employees working to prevent fraud and abuse in our stores. Our efforts to proactively stop foreign abuse are critical to creating a trusted shopping experience, not only for our customers but also for our honest selling partners. We're also proud of the work we've done to help our selling partners build thriving businesses beyond selling on Amazon. That includes hundreds of thousands of authors who have published millions of books through Kindle direct publishing, hundreds of thousands of SMBs and start-ups using Amazon Web Services and hundreds of thousands of third-party developers who built more than a hundred thousand skills for Alexa.  </p><p>These opportunities enable a wide variety of entrepreneurs to sell their products, fuel their creative passion, grow their business and create jobs. I look forward to answering any questions the committee may have.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. Miss Swanson, you're now recognized.  </p><p>SWANSON: Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Chabot and distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I appreciate your leadership in making sure small businesses has every opportunity to grow and thrive and I look forward to sharing with you the many ways that Google is committed to supporting that goal.  </p><p>My name is Erica Swanson and I am the head of community engagement for grow with Google, which is Google initiative to create economic opportunity for all Americans. At Google, we are deeply proud of the ways in which we support the success of the small business community in the United States and globally and we believe large companies like Google should play a role in helping them succeed.  </p><p>Today, I will discuss Google's positive economic impact on American businesses, the products and tools we provide small businesses to help them succeed and grow with Google's free trainings and programs for Americans small business owners and employees.  </p><p>Google tools help American businesses find and connect with customers. In 2018, Google search and advertising tools helped provide $335 billion of economic activity nationwide over 1.3 million U.S. businesses website publishers and non-profits use our tools annually to grow their customer base and drive revenue.  </p><p>Two examples of small businesses that use our products and services to grow their business and reach new customers are Propel Electric Bikes in Brooklyn, New York and Nehemiah manufacturing company in Cincinnati, Ohio. I go into more detail in my written testimony about how these inspiring businesses are using our products to succeed.  </p><p>There are a number of ways our products and tools help small businesses meet their online goals. Businesses are discoverable not only in organic search, that's the standard non advertising search results but also through free business profiles on Google where businesses can list their websites, add photos, update their hours and more. In addition to free services, we have a robust suite of advertising products that help small businesses reach the right customer at the right time.  </p><p>For every $1 invested in Google ads, our estimates suggest that businesses make an average of $2 back in revenue. With Google Analytics on a business website, the owner can better understand their customers to make online effort--online marketing efforts even more effective. And Google's suite of workplace productivity tools called G suite helps small businesses work more efficiently. Google also plays a part in helping small businesses reach new customers who are outside the U.S. Small business exports contribute significantly to the U.S. economy.  </p><p>Market Finder is Google's free tool that enables any small business to identify the best expansion markets for their business, find shipping and logistic partners, adapt to local markets and start exporting to customers around the world. We understand that the magnitude of tools and resources available can be daunting. That's why we launched Google for small business, a dedicated online tool that curates our resources into a personalized digital marketing plan. We also help small businesses learn how to use our products and tools. Through our growth--through our grow with Google program, we are seeking to ensure that more Americans seize the opportunity that is created by technology.  </p><p>Since 2017, grow with Google has trained more than three million Americans in all 50 states. We do this through our free online tools, partnerships with local organizations, delivering in-person trainings, and providing philanthropy to organizations that are helping some businesses learn skills. We also know how important it is to support small businesses that are just getting started.  </p><p>So last month, as part of our $1 billion global commitment to create more economic opportunity for everyone. Google.org announced a $10 million U.S. commitment to help low-income underrepresented entrepreneurs start their businesses by providing access to training, mentoring, and much-needed capital. Our grow with Google programs continue to evolve to meet the needs of our users.  </p><p>For example, just last week, we partnered with the Small Business Administration to support National Veterans Small Business Week. We also launched a series of new resources that support the 2.5 million veteran led businesses in the United States.  </p><p>In conclusion, the future of small businesses online is right and we are proud of the role we play. We appreciate the opportunity to highlight Google's contributions to helping the small business community and we thank you. We look forward to your questions.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. Dr. Kennedy.  </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you very much Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Chabot, and members of the committee. I'm pleased to be here to talk about the impact that large internet companies are having on small business. I'd like to make five basic points in my opening statement.  </p><p>The first is that large Internet platforms deliver tremendous benefits to small business. Any business now can set up a free website. But it can also set up social networking accounts for free using Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Amazon. Not only that it can also you--use market platforms like eBay and Amazon to sell worldwide to potential customers. These platforms offer--an off--often offer a variety of other services such as handling the payments, shipping, handling returns thus saving the small business from having to do that itself.  </p><p>Gig platforms match small business men and women with potential customers that are interested in their services that save, allowing them to build a clientele without spending more money on print advertising, radio or mail inserts. And finally, a separate set of platforms including Microsoft and Google offer cloud services on demand for colors--for small businesses.  </p><p>My second point is that these platforms share a common interest with the small businesses that use them and that is to offer a larger variety of good products and services which will attract more consumers, which will result in more sales. Platforms that don't do this successfully will lose market share.  </p><p>My third point is that this model isn't--this fundamental model isn't new. We also have large retail chains including Costco, Safeway, CVS and Walmart which offer a shelf space to thousands of suppliers. These retail shops collect a lot of data on what's selling and occasionally, they make the decision to offer a competing profit or--be competing product. That product then sits on the same shelf often with those of its other suppliers and sometimes offered at a discount.  </p><p>Wherever this happens, consumers benefit. They get a broader choice and you get lower prices and this is exactly the type of competition that we should be encouraging. My fourth point is that globalization and technology have changed the optimum size of firms in many industries. Small firms feel pressure to grow in order to take advantage of a global market. But platforms relieve some of this pressure because they stand ready to take some of their fixed costs and turn them in the variable cost that can scale up or down with business conditions. And so, these include some of the ones I've mentioned; shipping returns, cloud-based--setting up cloud services.  </p><p>And then my final point is that antitrust should--policy should encourage competition but it should not protect companies whether they're large or small from the effects of that competition. Are--the fundamental guideposts for com--for antitrust should remain the consumer welfare standard which looks at whether a particular merger or a business activity will harm consumers by raising price, lower in quality or delaying innovation.  </p><p>Where these occur existing policy and law allows regulators and potential plaintiffs to take action to rectify the situation. But we should not use antitrust policy to try and accomplish other goals such as instilling privacy requirements or doing--trying to rebalance the political power between large or small companies. With that, I'll conclude my statement and I want to thank you again for this opportunity to talk to you and I look forward to your questions. Thank you.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Dr. Kennedy and thank you all for your testimonies. I will begin by recognizing myself for five minutes and I would like to address my first question to you Mr. Mehta. Some argue that Amazon doesn't just dominate the online market. It controls it access by creating a platform for sellers while also competing against those on--those same businesses.  </p><p>Doesn't a company that sells things and owns the platform where things are sold have an inherent advantage over other small businesses that it's competing against?  </p><p>MEHTA: Thank you, Chairwoman. First, we're holding this hearing and allowing Amazon to participate in this conversation. You know, I'm honored to be here. Let me address your question by comparing ourselves to what happens traditionally in the retail market. And when we talk about retail, we talk about the overall retail market. Amazon represents about 1 percent of the worldwide retail market, about 4 percent of the U.S. retail market.  </p><p>And whether you look at Walmart or Target or Trader Joe's or Costco, all of these major retailers have a private label business that competes with others in their store. For Amazon, our private label business represents about 1 percent of our total sales. If you look at most of these retailers their private label businesses represent anywhere from 18 to 85 percent of their total sales. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: I hear you. However, there--there--there are some research that shows that Amazon's own product consistently win the buy box and we know what it's winning the buy box. The area on the right hand, side of the page that says up to Cart. So this to me suggests that the buy box is designed to favor Amazon and potentially gives you an--an unfair advantage. But I have a lot of questions so let me proceed.  </p><p>Ms. Swanson, like Amazon, Google has market dominance in that 90 percent of all internet searches go through Google. Small businesses cannot survive on the internet if they cannot be found. However, when Amazon, Walmart, Verizon, Expedia and many more large companies spend millions advertising on Google and their ads appear on the first page, doesn't this crowd out the ability for small firms to advertise online?  </p><p>SWANSON: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for having us here and an opportunity to have this conversation. There are a number of ways that small businesses can be discovered online and at Google, we are proud to provide a range of options, both paid unpaid. We have a suite of tools that are free at no cost for small business--  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: And--and--and so, if you Google a restaurant that doesn't pay but is using your free space, that restaurant probably will show up on page five or seven and so they--that clearly gives an advantage for those who pay and that will show up in the first page.  </p><p>SWANSON: There are a number of ways that small businesses like this small restaurant could appear depending on the particular search query whether that search query included the restaurant's name. But typically, if it includes the restaurant name or--or a qualifier like near me, it will appear in the--the first organic search listing.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: How can entrepreneurs optimize their search results? Does Google Maps only identify restaurants and hotels on its mapping platform for those businesses that are willing to pay to be found?  </p><p>SWANSON: No, Madam Chairman--Chairwoman, we have a number of ways that small businesses can appear on Google search and maps, many of those are free. So for example grow with Google help small businesses claim their free Google my business listing. This allows a small business to share their website or if they don't have one create a website so that they show up in that local search on that map.  </p><p>They can share their hours; they can share customer reviews encourage that conversation with customers that's so important to building customer loyalty over time.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Mr. Mehta, small businesses just want to be treated fairly and understand Amazon's Terms of Use regarding pricing, fees and other arrangements. Is it true that for some businesses, 30 through 40 percent of their sales prices--their sales price goes back to Amazon?  </p><p>MEHTA: Chairwoman, the--the way our fees work for professional sellers on Amazon, they pay $40 a month here in the U.S. And then on top of that, they will pay a fee that depends on the product they sell, typically eight to 15 percent. Any additional fees are up to the seller based on additional services they choose to use such as our fulfilment services or advertising services.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Do you have a number as to the percentage that they pay back to Amazon compared to the profits that they're making?  </p><p>MEHTA: Madam Chairwoman, I do not have that data point in front of me. I'd be happy to have the team follow up.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Does--does Amazon gives sellers adequate notice and transparency of changes to fees or other terms of their seller agreement?  </p><p>MEHTA: Our fees are publicly posted, they're both available to all sellers before they start selling as well as anyone in the public can see those fees and we try to provide transparent advance notice before changing those fees--  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: You try to provide but do you in advance?  </p><p>MEHTA: Madam Chairwoman, I don't own our fees. I'm happy to have someone follow up at the specifics of what's been done in every instance. But we want our sellers to be able to plan for our fees and we try to make those fees very attractive. You know, for instance if I look at our fulfilment by Amazon fees that provide fulfilment cell--services for sellers, we benchmark those versus alternatives that the sellers have. And our fees on average are 50 to 80 percent lower than sellers' alternatives.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Well, what I'm asking you in--in the name of transparency and certainty for the small businesses is do you provide notices in advance giving them enough time? What about sellers that use Amazon warehouses. Do they have opportunities to reconcile if there is a dispute with Amazon and prevent their inventory from being seized?  </p><p>MEHTA: Absolutely. So when sellers send their inventory into our fulfilment centers, if they choose to use fulfilled by Amazon, they have visibility into their inventory; that inventory that's available for sale, when it's purchased. And if for any reason there's a dispute, we have 10,000 associates that support sellers every day, I mean respond to them quickly.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Does Amazon consider how long a seller has been using the platform before closing or suspending an account?  </p><p>MEHTA: When we close or suspend accounts, they can be done for a variety of reasons. If a count is suspended for potential fraud or abuse or other policy violations, we--we make decisions around closing accounts based on the activities that have happened in the potential policy violations.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. Now, I recognize the Ranking Member.  </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Mehta, in March, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in partnership with Amazon published a report detailing the impact of technology on rural communities. The report acknowledges that rural business owners who have already embraced digital technology are seeing tremendous results. What's been your experience in seeing the potential of e-commerce for growth by small businesses in rural America?  </p><p>MEHTA: Thank you, Ranking Member Chabot, for the question. It's a great question. you know, one of the powerful things that enabling sellers to sell in Amazon store has achieved is for these businesses that are often in rural America that have historically set up physical shops and they've only been able to reach customers within a small distance of their physical store. By selling on Amazon, we enable them to not only sell in their local district, but to sell across their state, to sell across the country, and increasingly sell across the world.  </p><p>You know, as one example a feature we launched recently called FBA export is a program for sellers that use our fulfilment services to export products to other parts of the world. It helps sellers find customers in other parts of the world, helps navigate export requirements. I mean, that just one program generated $1.8 billion in sales for American businesses.  </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you very much. Ms. Swanson, I'll go to you next. It's my understanding at about 96 percent of the people that occupy this globe are outside the borders of the United States, so there's a huge market out there for large and small businesses. And I've got a book here of growing small business exports by Google, and could you tell us obviously, we don't have time to go through all this, but what it--what is Google able to do to allow America's small businesses to more successfully market their products the globe?  </p><p>SWANSON: Thank you, Ranking Member Chabot. Being able to increase broader markets is increasingly important to small businesses. My family had a small business, a bakery in a small town and their market was their town. And today, a small business like that can reach and sell across the nation and across the globe. This is important to our economy. And--and to job creation in the United States, one recent study shows that six million jobs in the United States are--are supported by small businesses who are exporting.  </p><p>Google is proud to make it easier for small businesses to export their goods and to find new markets. Examples are--are straighter sports in South Dakota. They had this great little idea to build bikes that little kids could push without needing pedals so they can move without falling over. They have this great idea and now thanks to digital tools and the expanded market that the web enables, they've sold two and a half million bikes in 78 countries and the majority of their sales are coming from international exports.  </p><p>This is--this is really enabled because the market has--because the web has enabled small businesses to reach into these global markets to find new places to reach new customers.  </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you. Mr. Kennedy--Dr. Kennedy, I'm sorry. Some have suggested recently that we need a new regulatory regime to clamp down on tech companies and that the government ought to be determining, you know, what you do and how you do it etc, to a much greater degree than is existent today. Obviously, these are private companies but we also, you know, want them to--to be fair, you know, with the public and that sort of thing. What is your view relative to additional regulations coming out of Washington? Mike.  </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you. I tend to be very skeptical of that. I think that the--the government's primary purpose should be to try and ensure a competitive market and to try and make sure that there's active competition that results in good products at low prices going to consumers. It--it should be reluctant to take aside in the various battles that occur between businesses over different practices or the--the--you know, getting market share, the one exception is where there are is either a merger that could result in monopoly power or where there are clear uncompetitive practices.  </p><p>And there I think the existing antitrust laws already give regulators and potential plaintiffs the bit--with--the powers that they need to restore competition. I do think it's worth having an--a dialogue about fair business practices in general in transparency and consistency. But I'm very reluctant to have the government mandate those. I think it's--your--it's likely be more productive if that if decisions are arrived at by in an open conversation.  </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you very much. My time is expired, Madam Chair.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: If you have any other question, you are free. The Chair recognizes Ms. Davids from Kansas.  </p><p>DAVIDS: Thank you, Chairwoman, and--and Ranking Member Chabot, for holding this hearing today and I think this is a really important conversation as it relates to--to our country small businesses. Finding a fair market place than competing with big businesses has always been a challenge for small businesses. And using and competing with tech large--text--tech companies however is a--a new iteration on that issue.  </p><p>So it's vital that we ensure that online marketplaces provide a fair online space for businesses to compete and I actually, I'm going to follow up on the Ranking Member's line of questioning because that's where I was headed anyway. So mister--sorry Dr. Kennedy, I noticed in your testimony and you actually started getting to it based on Ranking Member Chabot's questioning is can you talk to a little bit--talk to us a little bit about enhancing the rules governing fairness and transparency as it relates to how small businesses can interact with these large platforms that in some instances, they're both a customer and a competitor of the large platforms?  </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah, I can't--I don't feel I can get into a lot of detail but I used to be a general counsel of the Senate Subcommittee on investigations. And then, we found that when we saw a problem in a particular market, often if we called people in and we had a quiet discussion with them about why they did a certain thing and we could get a sensible resolution. And, you know, they--they would go off and amend their practice and I think that kind of informal dialogue can accomplish a lot.  </p><p>I think as far as specific things, in general, I think it's--it's reasonable for a business man to know what the rules are for a platform and to have them applied with some consistency. And--and as a general manner, I'd--I'd look at Costco or Walmart and I'd look and see how are they treating their suppliers and we don't seem to have a lot of problems with them.  </p><p>So, you know, if they have a particular practice, if Amazon and Google has a similar practice, I don't think necessarily we should have a problem with them either. I do note--I forget the gentleman's name but one of the people on the next panel has in his filed testimony some pretty good discussion of some of the issues and possible resolutions. So I think they're, you know, they're out there. </p><p>DAVIDS: In your testimony, you talked about the--an example of the United Kingdom's open banking initiative and the EU's payment services directive. Can you talk a little bit about that and why you use that as an example?  </p><p>KENNEDY: Well, I don't know--I don't know that--the great details are in them but in general they allow--my understanding is that they allow a banking customer to mandate that his infamy--his or her information be available to--to various outside apps.  </p><p>So that if you want to download an app that will download information from your say banking account and compare your fees to the fees of other banks and tell you how you could save on fees by moving to a different bank or--  </p><p>DAVIDS: So you think those--those kinds of policies might be helpful when we're talking about large internet platforms that are--are selling goods and services and having a very transparent process of understanding what your fees are versus if you are on--if you were paying for Google to put you in a search versus another searching platform, I'm actually not sure what--what other platforms folks use besides Google which kind of brings us to the point of how--how dependent small businesses might be on one or two specific platforms.  </p><p>Do you think that that--that's something that we need to see more of in these instances?  </p><p>KENNEDY: I think in general it is good to have a conversation with between Congress and the industries. It often is better to have it in--in private where people can, you know, don't feel under the gun that they have to get every word exactly right. And--and, you know, and I--I think that often that results in reasonable changes to business practices, you know, the--the platforms already have a strong interest--  </p><p>DAVIDS: My--my--my time is--my time is running out. I think I think the folks in my district might be a little surprised to hear you say that we should have meetings behind closed doors with large businesses. But I thank you for your time and thank you for your testimony today. I yield back.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Gentlelady yields back and the gentleman from Oklahoma Mr. Hern, ranking member of the Subcommittee on economic growth, tax on capital access is recognized.  </p><p>HERN: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. As you all know, every big business begins as a small business and as an entrepreneur or business owner, a job creator of thousands of jobs over 34 years, I appreciate the support that you've given the small business job creators of the world. I was just looking, I have five businesses that I created that my family members now run today. Thanks, being in Congress that use both of your services, either Google Suites, or the AWSS3 server system and cloud-based, other tools that you have. So I really appreciate it.  </p><p>And for Amazon, this support is represented by 500 million of AWS credits that you gave out in 2018. This has led to hundreds of thousands of small businesses start-ups using your web services to launch a scale your business--their businesses including over a million current small businesses utilizing their web services, 6,500 of which are in my home state of Oklahoma. As for Google, the support for small business is represented by the fact that in 2018, your search and advertising tools help to provide 335 billion of economic activity nationwide, 712 million of economic activity in Oklahoma and 1.69 million of free advertising the Oklahoma non-profits, benefits for over 7,800 Oklahoma businesses website publishers and non-profits and we thank you for that.  </p><p>This--both of you all are very well represented in our northeast Oklahoma area. The Google Data Center complex is just outside of my district which is--have had the opportunity to tour which I'm going the record for say it's very large. The Amazon Fulfilment Center coming to Tulsa in 2020 is the largest ever job employer ever in the history of northeast Oklahoma where we're at. So I really appreciate that.  </p><p>So with all of this, I would say that what you do also for--for the helping start small businesses start up and help with the--the protecting a small business from cyber threats, I would like for you just taking my remaining amount of time here so hopefully a min and a half each that each of you could talk about how beneficial these start-up services are and ability to continue on with your marketplace. We'll start with Amazon, your marketplace and cyber threats as we're seeing today, how you can help secure those fronts for--for small business and entrepreneurs.  </p><p>MEHTA: Thank you, congressman. You know, absolutely, one of the things that we find to be very powerful for these small businesses is the way that we can level the playing field, that we can provide access to not only the reach of hundreds of millions of customers, not only the large fulfilment centers and fulfilment capability we've built, but also the advanced Fraud and Abuse detection capabilities that protect the small and medium businesses that end up lowering costs for them and then going to continue to allow them to thrive. And we think it's some of the key ingredients that have continued to allow small businesses to grow so fast and become now 58 percent of our total sales.  </p><p>HERN: Thank you Ms. Swanson--Dr. Swanson--Ms. Swanson, I'm sorry.  </p><p>SWANSON: Still Ms. Thank you, Congressman Hern. we're really--Google is really proud to call Oklahoma home and--and pleased to hear that we have customers in your family. Cloud computing--cloud--cloud computing is one of the ways that we help small businesses take their security very seriously. Cloud computing can give small businesses an advantage that--that--that wasn't available many years ago. It can help them access their data from anywhere, anytime at a reasonable price and security and--and that safety is really built.  </p><p>And what we hear as we travel the country working with small businesses is that they're really good at what they do, they know their business. What they might not know as much about is the digital tools things like how to keep their data safe and so they--they turn to affordable products like cloud computing to keep their data safe.  </p><p>HERN: I appreciate both of your comments. The only thing I'd like to say in my remaining mini--moments is I think sometimes, people forget that every large business did start as a small business. And I think we often times forget, in the case of both your companies for sure and--and obviously Mr. Zuckerberg who's not here, your companies were started by the people who are currently involved in your companies and we just ask I think collectively as a bipartisan committee that they not forget where they came from. Whether it be Mr. brand and Mr. Page in their dorm room at Stanford or whether it be Mr. Bezos who I'd like to go on the record to say his first job was at McDonald's at 16 years old somewhere near and dear to my heart, and learned a lot from that lesson that they wouldn't forget and, you know, continue to help entrepreneurs create this competitive environment in the free market ideas that got them the ability to start and allow them to get to where they're at today that they would not forget that.  </p><p>And if that's a message that we could get collectively bipartisan out of this committee back to them and many of the other companies that have come from absolutely nothing, we'd like to make that message heard loud and clear. Thank you. I yield back.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Gentleman yields back and now we recognize Mr. Evans from Pennsylvania and vice chair of the committee.  </p><p>EVANS: Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I thank you for the leadership on this discussion because I like to start out with just a title. It--basically, the title is, a fair playing field; investing big tech impact on small business. I like to start out with I think is his name, Mr. Kennedy. Is that you?  </p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.  </p><p>EVANS: You were kind of given a general sense of what certain things you didn't think should happen in terms of what governments should do and here. So you--you see that question, it's a very simple question. So kind of give me your reaction to that question that we are just attempting to do our oversight responsibilities, you know, we know the importance of small business in this nation and the role that it plays.  </p><p>I come from the city of Philadelphia. We have like 25 percent poverty. I like to see more growth, more opportunity. So can you talk a little bit about relating to what you see is the fair playing field because what I heard you mention as a solution was kinda using a soft stick of conversation. So talk a little bit to me about how you view a fair playing field.  </p><p>KENNEDY: So--so I--I think the government should work hard to make sure that it is easy to start a business as--as--as possible, that it is easy to get credit and a, you know, consulting help is as possible. That when a business does create it--get created, that it, you know, the markets it is in is are competitive and give it a fair shot, that, you know, that the rules of the market, the laws are, you know, fairly applied.  </p><p>But it shouldn't try and favor one set of businesses over the other whether they're small--small businesses versus big business or platforms versus sellers. It should allow that competition to go on and, you know, that competition inevitably results in losers who complain. But unless there's, you know, demonstrated unfairness in the rules of the market in which case, antitrust already has the powers to deal with it, the government, you know, should leave well a lot--well enough alone.  </p><p>EVANS: Well, if you were whipping out your report card at this point and you look at where we are, and obviously this is new to all of us. I mean, we're just fully trying to understand it. But, you know, we hear a lot of complaints about individuals not being able to get into the marketplace as you say government should just leave it like it is, then what are you rating it at this point?  </p><p>KENNEDY: Well, I think the--the company is testifying today and the other ones we've mentioned, they already have a--a significant interest in expanding the number of small businesses that used--and big businesses that use their platform and if working with those businesses--businesses to grow, you know, to grow their volume. So that--that incentive already exists.  </p><p>Now, there's (INAUDIBLE) at the margin about this rule or that rule or how its applied and I think, you know, government usually doesn't--it is better off not getting too involved in setting those rules but, you know, should concentrate on is the competition on the whole fair.  </p><p>EVANS: But would you agree you may, you may not, would you agree that it is critical that small businesses are given an equal opportunity to enter the marketplace and flourish?  </p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.  </p><p>EVANS: okay. Well, I guess that's why I was kind of trying to drill down on a question in, you know, what--what's your view of because obviously, you know, maybe some cases, it may not be working.  </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah. and I think the central question antitrust officials ought to ask is--is what's going on hurting the customer? So if--if--if competition is--is putting some companies out of business but prices are going down, efficiency is going up, consumers are benefiting, then that--that's okay. If consumers are getting hurt because companies are getting monopoly power and they're raising prices, then that's not okay and we have antitrust policies. But we ought to look at how is the consumer being helped to hurt.  </p><p>EVANS: Thank you and I yield back the balance of my time.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Minnesota Mr. Hagedorn is recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>HAGEDORN: Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking Member Chabot. I appreciate the witnesses. I--I represent a rural part of southern Minnesota there and so obviously for small businesses and entrepreneurs wanting to get their start, the platforms that you provide can make a--a huge difference. They haven't in many instances so, you know, especially from a rural standpoint, I get it and I think as my colleague congressman Hern said, in many ways, this is--this really good thing.  </p><p>But I did too with someone in my office recently. Mr. Metha (PH) about a product that a woman named Sophia had on your platform. She's selling espresso machines, had about a hundred thousand put into the business, very happy because doing it through you she can work from home and all sorts of kind of you'd say luxuries for a business owner to be able to--to be able to do those types of things.  </p><p>But she said there were certain costs, you know, 15 percent on average goes to your company to sell their machines there could be storage costs if you have machines at the warehouses and things like that, and also some advertising. So in general, do you think the way that you're charging these small businesses is fair? Are there ways to look at that to make sure that they're not being gouged? How would you respond to that?  </p><p>MEHTA: Congressman, thank you for the question. You know, fundamentally, the way we view this is that we succeed when sellers succeed our growth over the years, a large part of it is because of the success of these small, medium businesses. And so, we want to make sure we offer a set of services at a set of fees and prices that are super attractive and reasonable.  </p><p>Now, advertising as one of those can be very powerful for that rural business that has an unknown brand that no one may know about that maybe has invented an amazing espresso maker. We want them to be able to advertise their products but advertising is a choice. I mean, for the brand that is known and is generating the sales or the awareness that they want, they don't need to buy advertising.  </p><p>And so, we try and make as many of these a choice a simple choice with easy-to-use tools so that different small medium businesses can pick the set of services that work best for them.  </p><p>HAGEDORN: Yeah, that's a very good answer, it makes sense. You want your clients to be successful and from a consumer standpoint, it's awesome for us to be able to go there and wherever it is and find all these different choices and--and shop and--and things of that nature.  </p><p>So then, I would move on to the--the other aspect of this which is kind of the infrastructure of how we search for companies that can provide services and products. So I'd go to the Swanson. How do we know for sure that your company isn't picking winners and losers in the marketplace that you don't--you're not really fronting for companies that may advertise more or, you know, just in general how can we be assured that that's not happening because you're the infrastructure, you're like the road and if you just decide that only certain cars and trucks get to go out first or get to drive faster and everybody else is left behind, that wouldn't be fair. So in this case, with the internet, how would you respond to that?  </p><p>SWANSON: Thank you congressman for the question. A Google search we--we build, we design for everyone, the business model of search is dependent on being useful and being trustworthy for our users. So we have a natural long-term incentive to prevent--to prevent that type of--of activity on our platforms.  </p><p>We--we build those--those platforms and that those products in a really neutral way and--and we work hard to make sure that we're continuing to improve search to surface the most reliable most--were most reliable most relevant answers for our search users in real time.  </p><p>HAGEDORN: Who--who audits you to determine whether or not that's happening because you don't know what you don't see, right? So if I put in a search for widgets but some company, it doesn't come up how would I ever know that? So who would--who would kind of look over your shoulder to make sure that that's--that's being done properly?  </p><p>SWANSON: Yeah, we have a series of processes and safeguards in place that allow us to continue to test and then evolve and improve the way that search functions, some of the ways we do that for example are running hundreds of thousands of experiments every year and asking independent search users to review the quality of those--those search improvements, always looking to understand are we providing the most relevant reliable answers to our search users. We take that feedback into account; we take it very seriously.  </p><p>HAGEDORN: Yeah, I'm not always for too much regulation in the marketplace and things like that. I think we should make sure that in the future, there's at least somebody who's overseeing this or looking at the results to make sure that if it--if it's not happening then we have to make some changes because I think you would want to be the first ones to make changes so the government wouldn't move in and regulate in these areas.  </p><p>But it's pretty important I think for businesses and the consumers that--that--that be done on a fair basis. Thank you.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman yields back and the gentleman from Maine, Mr. Golden, chairman of the Subcommittee on contracting and infrastructure recognized.  </p><p>GOLDEN: Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Mehta, I want to ask, does Amazon use algorithms that favor sellers over--who use fulfilment by Amazon over those who choose to do fulfilment by merchants?  </p><p>MEHTA: Thank you, congressman, for the question. The short answer is no. We design our algorithms for search and the products we feature based on what we think customers want regardless whether those products are sold in Amazon--  </p><p>GOLDEN: Just to be clear, not products but sellers.  </p><p>MEHTA: We don't design them to favor sellers or products based on who's selling them or the fulfilment Channel. We designed them to prioritize what we think customers want most.  </p><p>GOLDEN: All right. I guess, you know, we are--we've heard from some people back home in Maine who are concerned that that may not be the case and perhaps, you know, you have a better explanation. But has Amazon never been willing to maybe do some third-party testing or something on its algorithms which of course would be done to avoid revealing how the precise mechanisms work but could confirm for--for sellers that there is in fact no--no biased or people who use one or--or the other?  </p><p>MEHTA: Yeah. so I have to have someone from our search team follow up but I do know we run constant experiments looking at our search results to make sure we're prioritizing what customers want most and that we're avoiding any type of unintentional bias in that system, and we'd have to have that team follow up with you.  </p><p>GOLDEN: I would appreciate that very much and obviously, that would be important to--to avoid that kind of a unfair bias and, you know, we--we have a company in Maine that sells products to help keep houses from losing heat in the wintertime. They choose to ship their own orders and believe that they've noticed that their product has started missing out on search placement and sales to competitors who use FBA.  </p><p>They believe their experience is backed up by testimony from the Institute for local self-reliance out of July house antitrust subcommittee hearing and a letter to Congress from another seller described in a November 8th Bloomberg article. You know, another concern but we have that impacts sellers ability to choose whether or not they want to use FBA instead of going with their own option is that sometimes, Amazon may suspend sellers accounts if they deliver items late.  </p><p>I understand you're--you're trying to look out for consumers but I also understand that you may exempt sellers who use FBA from similar penalties. I'm just curious, is there a penalty to Amazon itself under FBA for--for late delivery that would either recompensate the--the seller or the consumer similar to the way that the people who do fulfilment by merchant?  </p><p>MEHTA: Thank you, congressman. Yeah, if an order is delivered late by our fulfilment services, Amazon takes responsibility for that order, make sure the customer is made whole and we do not hold sellers liable for that. So we do take accountability for this. All right, good, good it just seems like a comment. You know, if you're going to hold--hold yourself to the standard, you would hold other--you know, well some of your clients do. That would be important. I appreciate that.  </p><p>If I could shift over to Ms. Swanson, I think we're going to hear some testimony from the second panel and I do have some concerns I'm just curious in--in learning more about it having to do with some of Google's blue book, a room button changes and also some potential changes recently this year having to do with how people are able to find businesses, phone numbers.  </p><p>And I think one of the, you know, you probably heard many questions about the blue button, you know, in a system where-essentially people are often booking whether they know it or not through OTAs.  </p><p>GOLDEN: You know, you may have a consumer seeking to--to purchase a room directly from a--a hotel or a bed and breakfast or something and--and largely unaware that they are booking through an OTA when they use the blue book button. I'm curious if you have any feedback about that change? Have you considered whether or not you can build in the ability for consumers to choose to go directly to a business? And--and secondly, I've heard that there's been changes this year where a lot of searches no longer have phone numbers for businesses directly listed unless they opt to pay for--for that listing, essentially paying to have their own phone number, advertised and of course, as a consumer, very frustrating to think you've booked directly with someone then try and pick up the phone and call them and realize you can't. </p><p>SWANSON: Thank you, Congressman, for your question. There are a number of ways that a user might go about finding a service provider, for example, a hotel, could be to direct navigate to that website, could be to search for it, could discover it in organic search, or could choose to book through an OTA. You ask about some of those panels that we have on the right side of search. We--we do work to make it very transparent to the user. When they have the option of booking through the official site. There's a little button there that says the official site for example of that hotel, although some users may choose to book through an OTA for their own--own personal kind of shopping preferences and that's a choice that we want to--to provide. </p><p>You also asked a little bit about how to--how small businesses can make their phone number available. We know that's really important be able to provide that direct connection from search to a small business can be a critical way of initiating contact with that potential customer and through our local services, features, and products we can help small businesses list their phone numbers for free and their Google My Business listing, direct that call directly to that small business. </p><p>GOLDEN: Thank you. I appreciate that. I'm overdue on time. But I would just ask that you commit yourself to that transparency for consumers and particularly as you need to change your--your interface for things like this smaller screens, suddenly that transparency becomes much more difficult for consumers. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentlemen, yields back, and the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Balderson, ranking member of the subcommittee on innovation and workforce development is recognized for five minutes. </p><p>BALDERSON: Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you all for being here.  </p><p>I'm going to do a couple questions and kind of follow someone Mr. Hern's lead and I'll probably try to work with you some more but--you know, it's good for us to find out--you know, the technology side of the companies and American small businesses and I'm going to share more success side of it but Mr. Mehta and Ms. Swanson. Sorry, bad angle here.  </p><p>I--I first want to thank you both and your companies to date. In the district and in the state of Ohio, Amazon has invested $5 billion. And Google, you have invested closer to $7 billion. So thank you both very much.  </p><p>And I want to share a story. I did the groundbreaking ceremony for Google a couple of weeks ago. And I was pulling in the facility and I was driving and I'd look off to the side, I see one of my buddies, he's got waste dumpsters there. There was nine of them. I counted. So I got excited for him. I thought, wow, Google's actually working with small businesses here in the district and the--the communities. I know how important that was so I call Seth up and I say, \"Hey, Seth, congratulations, man. I'm looking at your dumpsters here on. I see nine of them out here.\" And he said, \"Nine. He said they're better be 14.\" I said, \"Well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\"  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But anyway, so just thank you because that's meaningful to small business owners in those districts when you build these huge data centers. So thank you very much. Would each of you please explain to this committee what the growth of the internet and--and the information age has meant for small businesses? </p><p>Ms. Swanson, ladies first. </p><p>SWANSON: Thank you, Congressman, for the--for the question and--and thank you for the kind words about our data centers. What you saw as part of a $13 billion investment that Google is making across America to--to create new data centers and expand our offices. And we're committed to working with small businesses in--in these communities. As part of that work.  </p><p>We really see the internet and--and Google products and tools as--as--as being great equalizers as--as being tools that help small businesses, do things, reach customers, and become discoverable in ways that used to be only available to the very biggest of businesses. It used to be that if you were a small business and you wanted to market to customers, you had few options. They were TV, they were radio, maybe--maybe outdoor, out of home in some way. And now if you're a small business, you can set your budget and with very limited budget even make really effective, focused online media advertising campaigns.  </p><p>And--and we here that's a game changer as we travel the country. We hear from small businesses again and again that this is helping them find the right customer at the right time, in ways that they could not have imagined before. </p><p>BALDERSON: Okay, thank you.  </p><p>I--I want to jump to another question because from time limit that we're on here and because I do want to talk about the positive things that are created from tech, big techs and from small businesses.  </p><p>I'd like to highlight a recent meeting that I had with a constituent of my district, who actually, I wouldn't say went out of business but pretty much just shut down his business that he had prior to that. In doing so then he changed and started up another business, a vintage bookseller business and he used Amazon's tools and including the fulfillment by Amazon. And his business just in the last year has grown 500 percent. He's had to expand his workforce. And he now shifts to customers across the U.S. and Canada.  </p><p>Would you--both of you--and, Mr. Mehta, you can go first on this one would--would you--each of you please tell this committee how many businesses, publishers, or nonprofits benefit from your services that you're aware of? </p><p>MEHTA: Yeah, thank you, Congressman, for the question. And--and that story of vintage book art company is another awesome story of many entrepreneurs and small businesses across America. You know, currently, there's more than 1.9 million small businesses, content creators, authors, etc, that are small and medium businesses across the U.S. that are partnering with Amazon and growing as a result and--and interestingly, these small businesses have generated more than 830,000 new jobs for Americans. And so we're very excited both about that specific business but in general about what we've been able to do together with partnership with small businesses. </p><p>BALDERSON: Thank you both very much for your investment in Ohio and Madam Chair, I yield back my remaining time. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman yields back and now the gentleman from New York, Mr. Espaillat is recognized for five minutes. </p><p>ESPAILLAT: Thank you, Madam Chair.  </p><p>My question goes to Mr. Mehta. I want to touch base on the Amazon storefronts. Small businesses, approximately 30,000 small and medium-sized businesses you mentioned in your prepared statement participate in Amazon storefront. My question is, what is Amazon's practice for outreach? And do you know the demographic or geographic break--break down are participating small and medium-sized businesses? </p><p>MEHTA: Thank you, Congressman, for the question. You know, Amazon storefronts is very exciting. We have 30,000 small businesses already participating. They've reached 70 million customers and sold over 250 million items. We have a number of different ways we try and outreach to these small-medium businesses. It starts with a great deal of online content and help.. Programs like our Seller University that provide courses and training and videos and webinars to help the small-medium businesses. And just recently, we announced a new Amazon Small Business Academy where we send Amazon employees into local communities to sit side by side with small businesses as they get started on Amazon and help them as they start selling. So very excited about storefronts and very excited about Small Business Academy.  </p><p>ESPAILLAT: And when Amazon--when an Amazon search for product yields a result, are these products shown contemporaneously with relevant products or how does that work? </p><p>MEHTA: So when a customer places a search result on Amazon-- </p><p>ESPAILLAT: --Yes-- </p><p>MEHTA: --we use the query that they typed in to try and find what we think will be the best products regardless of who's selling it or how they're selling it but what we think the customers most likely to want and we put those in front of the customer. </p><p>ESPAILLAT: And--and do the results delineate Amazon storefront and those that are not? Is this the same for English-language searches versus Spanish searches or other non-English languages? How--how is that handled? If I was to search in Spanish, for example? </p><p>MEHTA: Yeah. So customers speak many different languages and we try and support them in their native language. And so when we design our search results, we do think about who the customer is and where they're searching and customize the search results accordingly. </p><p>ESPAILLAT: Okay, my next question is regarding--what is your reimbursement schedule or model for products sold through or on--on Amazon for small businesses? Is it uniform or can the vendor work to address or meet the needs of the industry? Let's say for example, seasonal, or employee design? Small businesses obviously have a very strong constraints very often. How do you handle your reimbursement schedule? </p><p>MEHTA: Thank you, Congressman, for the question. On average, our selling partners are paid seven days after a customer receives the product. And so--and we like to make that very quick as soon as after the customer receives the product. </p><p>ESPAILLAT: Thank you so much. I yield back my time.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman yields back.  </p><p>And let me take this opportunity to thank all the witnesses for taking time to be here and answering our questions. You are now excused and we will take a moment while we get our next panel up. Thank you </p><p>UNKNOWN: (OFF MIC) these microphones here? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yeah.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: I will ask everyone to please take your seat.

And we thank you all so much Reading here.  </p><p>I yield back. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman's back. Ms. Cavaretta, now you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>CAVARETTA: Thank you, Chairman Velasquez, Ranking Member Chabot, and the members of the committee. I am Allyson Cavaretta, a multi-generation, small-business owner at the Meadowmere Resort in Ogunquit, Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.  </p><p>I am here to explain why Google's most recent actions and travel present concern to small business, how those behaviors harm the consumer, and to urge relief from Google's near monopoly access to market.  </p><p>While Google's testimony from July 2019 states that they are proud to work with small businesses that claim's not uniform. While Google's testimony from--excuse me examples of an unequal playing field for hoteliers range from a 2015 pay-to-play book here button to currently prohibiting access to the posts and view room products. Most recently March 2019's algorithm change prioritizes paid products reportedly wipe $13 billion in market value of the largest players in travel harming direct bookings with small hotels like mine.  </p><p>The results often mislead the consumer to the highest bidder and not to our website. Google is an unavoidable gatekeeper, over 93 percent of searches began on Google. Since June, a majority of the searches result in zero clicks because Google sends these clicks to their own products, YouTube, Maps, subdomains of google.com and over a dozen others. Our July correspondence to Congress on the March update is stated just one day after Google claimed to not engage in such practices at a House Judiciary Committee hearing.  </p><p>I will focus on the Google My Business listing product, commonly referred to as the GMB and as I will refer to it as such hereafter, an increasing middleman. Since the march update took effect when comparing May through September this year against last year, the following concerns are observed for our hotel, a 36 percent increase in visits to that GMB product from Google's own search or Maps products, but only a 5 percent increase in visits to our website from the GMB. A 22 percent increase in phone calls to our GMB but a concerning 33 percent decrease in direct phone reservations. The click through rate of 3.8 percent for our listing is an outstanding search results and across all industries an average click through rate for search ads is only 1.91 percent.  </p><p>And I cannot help but wonder if Google's able to push the GMB performance to outstanding levels by funneling searches to its own product complete with pay-to-play bookings. The transparency into such behaviors a challenge. Our hotel deploys urgent tracking module parameters commonly called UTM codes and that evaluates online--online marketing. A snapshot of UTM tracking for our listing demonstrates a shift of over 37 percent in website traffic in just seven days.  </p><p>When Google arbitrarily removed this tracking a small business has limited data. This is in stark contrast to the extensive metrics that Google Analytics offers. And I cannot help but wonder why Google does not subject the GMB product to the same metrics that other ads and traffic sources are scrutinized by. This is concerning. We estimate a year over year shifted over $140,000 in revenue now dependent on this listing in just six months.  </p><p>The speed at which Google is impacting the market access for small business and for the consumer is quite alarming. From 2016 to 2019, the cost to protect direct bookings to our hotel has meant an increase spending over 500 percent with Google and a 20 percent increase in our overall marketing budget to keep up. And we are not an isolated incident as my testimony notes over 900 innkeepers representing 47 states in the District of Columbia support the points I am making today.  </p><p>There are strong incentives to pay-to-play. Travel is a lucrative ecosystem where consumers rely on digital information. Digital travel sales worldwide increased over 10 percent in $694 billion in 2018. However, the consumer cannot discern the paid products like Google's book a room button do not lead to the hotel directly. Over 70 percent of consumers believe that they are booking directly when in fact they are redirected by the bid system that is frequently won by online travel agents. There are similar concerns with consumers accessing our phone number.  </p><p>Nowhere does Google educate the public that Google is diverting the consumer away from a small business. And while I do not fault them for making decisions on their bottom line, the net impact to small business and consumers is concerning. They loom over innkeepers, the community of small hoteliers now has very high cost to market. And a century ago, we saw such similar things for perishable goods because of the railroads. We are now at the end of the line for today's modern equivalent, the internet. I would ask that the committee look to hardwire a fair playing field in for hotels and for all small businesses.  </p><p>And I thank you for listening and for the opportunity to present today. I look forward to answering any questions that you may have. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Hart. </p><p>HART: My name is Molson Hart. Almost 10 years ago, I founded a toy company named Viahart. We have--we have four full-time employees and we sold about $4 million of product on Amazon last year and should sell about $5 million on Amazon this year.  </p><p>I speak Chinese. I know manufacturing, logistics and e-commerce. And with regards to big tech, Amazon is my area of expertise. With my testimony. I'm going to give you a bird's eye view of what it's like to operate a small business in Amazon's orbit, as well as answer the questions posed by the hearing summary. I will also submit detailed documents for the record that describe issues small businesses and consumers face on Amazon, what government can do about it and whether they should.  </p><p>To the question, has Amazon created business solutions that have enabled small businesses to reach and serve new customers? The answer to that question is yes, absolutely. Their Fulfillment by Amazon program solved logistical issues for small businesses that previously would have required big investments or big headaches. This has enabled small businesses to offer--to offer less expensive and innovative products more easily to American consumers.  </p><p>Everyone, perhaps with the exception of brick and mortar retailers, has won, Amazon, small businesses and consumers. As a result, Amazon owns e-commerce. We can talk statistics but just trust me. For most categories such as books, toys, electronics, home goods and gifts, basically everything but cars, food, gasoline, luxury and convenience, Amazon is dominant. In 2018, despite selling on eBay, walmart.com, our own website, and brick and mortar stores, Amazon accounted for 98 percent of our revenue.  </p><p>So, do small businesses like ours rely on Amazon? Yes, completely. When they say jump, we say how high? If Amazon suspends us from the platform, we go bust, and we go bust fast. In 2018, we paid $2 million to Amazon. And Amazon's expenses as a share of our revenue on Amazon have gone from 33 percent in 2013 to 50 percent in 2018. That said, we've been profitable and our sales have grown 37 percent every year over that period.  </p><p>So do small businesses have an opportunity to compete in the information age? It's not easy and we work hard but we as a small business have done all right. So yes, we do have an opportunity to compete amongst big tech. But is the playing field fair? The answer to that is like a Facebook relationship status. It's complicated. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I laugh at my own joke. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>All right.  </p><p>If we compete against Amazon, we operate in a massive disadvantage but provided they don't gauge and underhanded tactics, that's okay. It's capitalist competition. If Amazon Basics knocks off one of our products, provided they didn't commit IP infringement, it's unfortunate but it's okay. On balance while they certainly make their fair share of mistakes, which I describe in my additional submission for the record and while they sometimes focus on what's legal, rather than what's ethical, they are a good company. They're also an engine for innovation. As such, we as a nation should take great care in legislating or regulating this giant but also fast moving and innovative company.  </p><p>Like in the Hippocratic oath, we should first do no harm. In keeping the metaphor it is said that sunshine is the best disinfectant. By shining light on the issues, we can compel Amazon to do a better job in addressing them. Since selling on the platform, I've seen them make great strides towards improving their marketplace for honest sellers and consumers. While I do think there are some areas where legislation and regulation is appropriate. In general here, the threat of it is stronger than its execution.  </p><p>We can do better for American consumers, American small businesses in the entire United States by proceeding with caution and introducing narrow legislation that addresses the nagging problems on the platform. My additional submission for the record not only describes these problems in details--but also in detail but also suggests legislative solutions that can win bipartisan support and better America for all stakeholders.  </p><p>So let's do it. Let's do it now. We have unique opportunity and time to improve our country by doing so and I look forward to working with you to make it happen. Thank you for this opportunity. And I welcome your questions. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Hart. Mr. Feld, you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>FELD: Thank you, Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Chabot. Thank you for having me here today.  </p><p>In a world where people find restaurants by asking their phones to show them the best reviewed places on their map apps, where people research their purchases and comparison shop online, and where viral video or tweet can make you famous in a good way or a bad way, we must acknowledge the impact of big tech goes well beyond startup garages in Silicon Valley. Big tech impacts every Main Street in America. Digital platforms are only the latest technology to transform how we do business. Just as it is impossible to imagine our economy without the ability to ship goods anywhere or to operate without electric power or to manage without credit cards, money transfers, and global communication systems, it is impossible now to imagine a small business without somehow interacting with big tech.  </p><p>As with these previous technologies, Congress must set rules of the road to protect small businesses from anti-competitive abuse and provide the stability necessary for investment and for commerce to thrive. We have seen in the last few years a growing stream of credible allegations that the largest online platforms have used their dominant position to favor their own products, unfairly undermine competitors, or extract concessions from small businesses with no real alternatives.  </p><p>For example, Amazon has been accused of altering its recommendation algorithm to suggest purchases based on what maximizes profit to Amazon, rather than what consumers would most like purchase--most like the purchase. Google was found guilty in the EU favoring its affiliated products in its shopping app. Facebook has been accused of denying access to potential competitors such as Vine and extracting concessions from applications developers once they were locked into the platforms. The company's denied some of these accusations but the list continues to grow.  </p><p>But even more troubling, are the growing number of cases where giant digital platforms hurt small businesses entirely by accident or when trying to do the right thing. If this were simply about finding and punishing a few bad apples, we could leave this to existing law. But what can a small business do when a fake complaint by a rival can get them kicked off Amazon with no notice effectively shutting down their business? Or when a decision by YouTube to change its monetization policy can bankrupt thousands of small creators at once?  </p><p>Congress must step up as it has done in the past, as it did when access to railroads or to reliable banking services or to electric power became essential inputs for small businesses. Congress must set some basic rules of the road that ensure that everyone gets treated fairly. Ideally, Congress would create a comprehensive statute addressing digital platforms at a new expert agency to enforce it. Digital platforms are unique sector of the economy subject to powerful network effects that make them prone to concentration. At the same time, many of the things that create the capacity for competitive harms also create the capacity for significant consumer and business benefits. A sector specific regulator is best equipped to investigate concerns and strike the proper balance. Public knowledge recognizes that this is an ongoing process.  </p><p>We therefore urge Congress to focus in the short term on the following four things as most important to protecting small businesses and promoting competition. One, non-discrimination, search and recommendation algorithms should treat everyone fairly not based on how much profit goes to the platform or App Store. Two, interoperability. Small businesses and potential competitors with the platform should have the ability to plug and play without interference from the platform.  </p><p>Three, protection of proprietary information. Small businesses expose sensitive information as part of their dealings with digital platforms. Platforms should not be able to exploit that access. Four, due process. Businesses need sufficient notice to plan and the right to correct mistakes that can cost them their business.  </p><p>Thank you, and I am happy to answer any questions. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Feld. Ms. Prodromitis, you're recognized. </p><p>PRODROMITIS: Thank you--thank you, Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Chabot and all the esteemed committee members.  </p><p>My name is Theo Prodromitis and I am a family member of Greek immigrants, U.S. veterans--very proud veterans, and entrepreneurs. You could say entrepreneurship is in my DNA. And I grew up working in our family businesses. So all of this talk in the committee about small businesses, I'm one of them. I have also had the great pleasure on being on the National Retail Federation Small Business Advisory Council and in that capacity have gotten to work with thousands of different small businesses understanding their pain points.  </p><p>But for the topic today, we'll talk about the product line that I launched called Spa Destinations. In 2003, we launched our line of personal care products. But in 2008, something happened and we had to downsize and pivot. One of our big issues at that point, in addition to the economy, was the impact of the market flooded with subpar Chinese imports. And our $20 premium natural sponge that was hand selected and--and harvested from the Gulf of Mexico as a natural renewable resource now suddenly could not compete with a $2 synthetic sponge imported from China. And that was the impact it had on us because we needed somewhere to tell our story.  </p><p>So in 2014, we heard about selling on Amazon and all of our colleagues thought we were crazy. They thought Amazon was the competition or the enemy and they told us not to do it. Luckily, we didn't listen. So we started small and it's $39.99 to get a seller account. And we started listing some of our products on Amazon. And Eureka! Our business started to grow over and over again because we featured in on the Amazon democratizing opportunity, which is the best brand wins. It's not just price, it was that the fact that we could actually tell our brand story on a platform and they gave us access to their millions and millions of customers.  </p><p>So Amazon provides conferences and Seller University, everything we need. It's a really robust platform that gives us access and there's people there 24/7 to answer our questions. Yes, we have the same business challenges everybody does. But now we have a logistics expert that allows us to actually focus on product innovation and investing in our own businesses, growing our own staff, and doing the things that we need to do in our small business on this platform. They make a lot of the services very affordable and give small businesses and premium brands like myself a voice.  </p><p>Noteworthy is that Amazon, of course, does disrupt industries and categories and we all know that. So for example, when they disrupted the delivery with Prime, it got everybody to innovate, and everybody sort of stepped it up. And they started delivering faster because Amazon focuses and holds us accountable to a customer centric model where we have to put the customers first. And Dr. Kennedy's testimony said that in the most competitive environment in my 30 years experience in retail, the most important thing is that the customer is treated fairly. And they also created a professional beauty category to actually decrease the number of counterfeits and to address some of the issues with the market being flooded with used products or substandard products.  </p><p>So in conclusion, there's a few important statistics I just wanted to reiterate. One is that as part of the National Retail Federation, one of their published statistics is that 10 percent of retail sales--only 10 percent are done online. So there's still a huge additional market. It seems like it--it eclipses everything else but it only accounts online sales for 10 percent of all retail. And of course, the one that matters to me the most is that the Amazon platform and building our business after the downsizing in 2008, has given me the opportunity to grow a multimillion dollar business, take care of my kids, and to grow and innovate and focus on what my expertise is in partnership with Amazon.  </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. Mr. Ward. </p><p>WARD: Madam Chair, Ranking Member Chabot, members of the committee, on behalf of the Connected Commerce Council and our members, it's good to be with you again today.  </p><p>The Connected Commerce Council is a nonprofit membership organization for digitally empowered small businesses. We believe that access to digital tools gives small businesses the best opportunity to succeed. This belief is informed and affirmed by each of our more than 2,500 member companies and supported by the numbers. In fact, a recent Deloitte study illustrates what our members would tell you. That small businesses that leverage digital tools have higher revenue, twice the profitability, and three time--create three times as many jobs.  </p><p>It's a privilege to be with you today and to share their perspective and the stories of some of these businesses. Stories like that of a Utah-based startup that invented an all in one bedding set that makes it easy for kids and adults to make their bed every morning. And for those of us that have attempted to make a bunk bed, this is an innovation on the level of the wheel and sliced bread.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Even then breaking into traditional retail market and competing against global giants is nearly impossible. With a quality product, a simple website, well-placed ads and access to online marketplaces, Betty's is now a thriving company employing dozens of people and serving a global customer base.  </p><p>While Betty's is an exceptional company, their success is not an exception. Digital services, platforms, marketplaces helped tens of millions of small businesses start, grow, and succeed in previously unimaginable ways. These tools provide lower cost options specifically designed to provide small businesses with more accurate, measurable, and efficient ways to enter into a market. And most importantly, those tools give small businesses a fighting chance, not only because of the scale of the platforms but also against some of those larger companies.  </p><p>For our part, it's hard to imagine a more competitive marketplace. The largest most innovative companies in the world compete fiercely to reach tens of millions of American small businesses. As a result, their prices are low, their products are innovative, and the business is good. In turn, small businesses use these tools and marketplaces and platforms to compete with one another with larger companies and with businesses in countries around the world. The result is more better, cheaper products for consumers everywhere and a more vibrant economy here at home. This is what a healthy market looks like. It's working.  </p><p>I'm not here to defend big tech today or to speak to the interests of those companies. They're more than capable of defending themselves. I'm here today to defend small businesses from the unintended consequences of overreacting, to defend an ecosystem, and an economy that is working, and speak up for tens of millions of American businesses whose livelihood, whose peace of mind, and whose bottom lines have been well-served by digital tools and the companies that produce them.  </p><p>CCC's concern is that we too often only focus on the largest companies missing the forest through the trees. The idea that regulators and policymakers are investigating free and local services that power small businesses confuses and frustrates many of our members. Access to digital tools is essential for American small businesses, not in concept or in a legal sense but in reality. As you know the answer to many of these challenges is policymakers should speak with small businesses, rather than simply talking about them.  </p><p>I'd like to thank you, Madam Chairwoman, Representative Chabot, and this committee for your leadership in welcoming small businesses to the table today because if asked, small business owners will tell you, the challenge of every small business is unique but their stories are universal. And that those challenges force small businesses to be early adopters and to adapt quickly, where others are too large or too complacent to take advantage. They would tell you that access to affordable, secure and scalable tools unleashes the potential of American small business and that the value of that access is measured in new employees and increased financial security.  </p><p>Every small business owner knows that starting a business is an act of faith. That running one is--is a matter of perseverance but success requires luck and a lot of help. Today that help comes in the form of global platforms and service providers. Digitally empowered small businesses stand on the shoulders of large companies to reach otherwise unattainable heights. Platforms invest in scalable, secure, affordable tools, marketplaces connect buyers with sellers, and the guiding principles of the digital economy, speed and scale, consistently drive shared value and mutual benefit for small businesses. Innovative technologies and approaches are widely available, easily adopted, and quickly improved upon.  </p><p>Now is not the time for political opportunism, or gamesmanship. The stakes are too high, and the issue too important. The partnership between big tech and small businesses are built on mutual benefit. Discussions about balancing that benefit are warranted and welcome. But we should also consider the harm changes to the current ecosystem could have on American small business economy that is thriving.  </p><p>On behalf of tens of millions of digitally empowered American small businesses, thank you for welcoming us today. I look forward to answering your questions. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Dufault--Dufault, you're recognized. </p><p>DUFAULT: Good afternoon. My name is Graham Dufault and I represent over 5,000 small businesses that build the software programs that bring your smart devices to life. Thank you for hosting this important hearing and for listening to the voices of small businesses in this debate.  </p><p>The App Association's primary focus here is on the--the mobile software market. And that includes the relationships between my member companies and big software platforms. You heard on the first panel about some really big numbers, billions of people, trillions of dollars that are impacted in this. But I want to focus on the smaller numbers, the father son team of two at Micro Integration Services in Medford, New Jersey, the team of 17 at Hash Rocket in Ohio, Florida, and Illinois, and the team of five in Duluth, Minnesota at Creative Arcade. </p><p>These are small numbers, but they add up in your districts to a really powerful engine of growth and we want to preserve that. Chairwoman Velasquez in your district, there's a teacher who create an app called Chaperone it helps organize school field trips in real time. And she's a problem solver and the App Store platform helps her creativity. Ranking Member Chabot, the team at Canned Spinach in your district created the augmented reality solution for Toyota so that shoppers can virtually experience cars from smart devices.  </p><p>And so how did big tech help small companies--these small companies that I just mentioned? Let's go back in time. Back in 1998, it could cost up to about $10 million to get a software company off the ground. Now 21 years later, it costs about $100,000. From an investor's perspective, a $100 million investment fund can go toward a lot more companies now and it can go toward market disruptors as opposed to sort of the sure bet. The pre--the pre-IPO incumbents.  </p><p>So how platforms made these radical changes possible? I point to three things. One, reduced overhead. Two, a trusted space. And three, immediate access to billions of consumers around the world. And so in this case, the fact that platforms software platforms, especially are household names has actually helped lead to the democratization of entrepreneurship here.  </p><p>Of course, for software companies coming by trust is a pretty expensive proposition. Even now, when you download a software program, it can be glitchy, it can give you a computer virus. And so a trusted source is extremely valuable. Back in the 90s, it used to be necessary for some developers to sign over their rights to publishers, just to deal with that trust issue. And so platforms have changed all of this by creating a trusted space where users know that their devices will remain secure. Not only that, they've done it in a way so that consumers and developers can transact directly.  </p><p>Each you probably has a smartphone in your pockets. And if you're like the average American, you have somewhere between 60 and 90 apps. The vast majority of those are made by small businesses that you've never heard of. So why is it that you trust the software that they've created enough to download it? And the answer is because the platform is created a dependable environment for you to do that. </p><p>Of course, it's not all sunshine and--and roses. Platforms into improving important ways. And we're very glad that the committee is conducting this inquiry so that we can understand the--the competitive forces at work. Our developers need a few things from platforms. Number one, they need developer guidelines, any changes made to them and explained clearly so that developers know what the changes are going to mean for them.  </p><p>And number two, we need safety and security. Some have control over device security and other platforms don't. But measures should be in place to ensure that consumers and developers alike are protected. And number three, platforms should diligently respond to even the smallest developer when they see that their content has been stolen by another developer on the platform. Right now, platforms are fighting for our business. This is an ideal state of affairs and it is a sign that competition is alive and well, at least in the app economy here.  </p><p>So from Congress our asks are simple. Number one, even by the most conservative estimates, 20 million Americans still lack access to broadband. I have a colleague from Orrington, Maine who's just six miles out of Bangor actually and her parents still use dial-up. Dial-up is still being used everywhere, all over the place here in the United States, it's still an issue. And we thank the committee for the efforts that--that you guys have embarked on to ensure that broadband is deployed to the hardest to reach parts of--of America.  </p><p>Number two, we appreciate the committee's efforts to ensure that Small Business Administration programs do what they're supposed to do. And we want to ensure--urge you to continue that work to ensure that tech driven businesses like my members have access to those support mechanisms as well. And then finally, we are here to provide adequate resources for workforce training programs so that we can fill the 500,000 computing jobs that are open right now in this country. So thank you again for the opportunity to appear here before the committee and I look forward to questions. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. Thank you all for your testimonies.  </p><p>Let me just say and share with you that in this committee, we work in a bipartisan way. There is no Republican or Democratic approach when it comes to issues that are impacting small businesses. So we are committed to accountability. And so when we have Amazon and Google come--come before us and we post questions regarding the treatment or the unlevel playing field for small businesses to be able to compete and not put at a disadvantage. And they tell me that they know because they do internal testing. Well, it's not only about internal testing, it's about accountability. And I believe that was Congressman Hern, who raised the issue, who is watching over you? Who is holding you accountable. And so that is what goes to--to the heart of the issue here.  </p><p>So, Mr.--Ms. Cavaretta. It is my understanding that over 96 percent of all hotel room bookings that take place through online travel agencies go through two companies, Expedia, and Bookings.com. They then pay millions of dollars to Google, which controls 90 percent of all internet searches. It seems to me that if you are a travel company looking to reach consumers, all roads lead to Google. Can you expand on how this happened and discuss how it impacts small businesses and ultimately consumers? </p><p>CAVARETTA: Certainly, Chairwoman, I'd be happy to address that today. And first off, thank you very much for the hearing and the opportunity.  </p><p>Two things come to mind with your question. First, when over 70 percent of consumers believe that they are booking directly with a hotel when in fact, they are redirected by Google's book a room button to the highest bidder. The traveling public is being misled. It's misdirection to that highest bidder. And often it's to the highest bidders of those two companies you mentioned or it's one of--one of their mass subsidiaries. I think Google can get to over 18,000 of Expedia's sites and they have that many. Or even worse, it can be a fraudulent fly by night site and you have an online booking scam.  </p><p>Second, our small business has to pay now to try to have our phone number found in searches and those searches spiked over the last six months since this recent update and it's still not being found as the data shows. So that secretive algorithm, the transparency that you're so concerned about, it determines whether or not we have our call extension shown even if we're paying for it or not. So if the consumer's directly searching for our phone number, the net effect is that Google has moved the ability for it to be found by the consumer into a pay-to-play space.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. </p><p>CAVARETTA: You're welcome.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Hart. You rightly recognize that Amazon has created business solutions that have enabled small businesses to reach new customers, solving logistical and transportation issue for millions of small firms. But you also acknowledge Amazon could do better. What are your targeted ideas to ensure that companies like Amazon and other large tech companies like them are not using their market power to put at a disadvantage small businesses? </p><p>HART: So at this point, I think the best course of action would be narrow legislation coming from Congress to address some of the nagging problems on Amazon and I laid some of them out in my additional submitted testimony. For example, there's a law called the DMCA where if someone files a--an allegation of copyright infringement the--the defendant as it were, has the right to submit a DMCA counter notice for that copyright infringement and kind of say to the person who's saying that you're infringing on the copyright, say, \"Look, if I'm infringing on your copyright, you've got to sue me.\" I think that that legislation should be extended towards trademarks and patents. And I think that that would clean up the marketplace enormously.  </p><p>The reason why is that there are a lot of brands in the United States that make allegations of trademark infringement towards companies that are selling on Amazon that are selling authentic goods. They want to keep their prices high. They don't want the competition on Amazon. So they say that that guy--you know, who's maybe in Ohio--maybe in rural Ohio who is selling products. That person is selling inauthentic goods, when in reality they're not. Amazon, in some cases, they may make the wrong decision, they may make the right decision, will suspend that seller from the platform. I think that's a pretty good example of how we can fix that problem.  </p><p>That problem has existed for three to five years, maybe even longer on the Amazon platform and haven't really done anything about it. So I think at this point, we could use some legislation. And in my additional submission, there are a whole host of other ideas like this then proof platform. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you.  </p><p>Mr. Feld. How should Congress approach ensuring small businesses are treated fairly on these large platforms?  </p><p>FELD: I have a number of specific suggestions. I think it's exactly that there needs to be somebody who can check. There needs to be somebody who has the authority to go in and ask questions. At the same time, the company's proprietary information needs to be respected. You don't want to expose the search algorithm itself because you don't want people to be able to hack it for illegitimate purposes. There are other suggestions in my written testimony and I'm happy to supplement because I see I'm running out of time. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. </p><p>So you listen to the companies that were here today. Does any--do any of you have any reaction to any point that was raised or any of the answers that were provided by either Amazon or Google? Mr. Feld. </p><p>FELD: I do want to address this point that Amazon makes about comparison of their own label with traditional supermarket labels because it's not really a fair analogy. The problem here is that Amazon acts much more as a distributor than as a retail market. If I go to a supermarket, yes, there's the generic brand label on the shelf but I also see all of the other--I mean, in the pet food section, for example, I see all of the other cat foods and if I'm on Amazon, however, I only see the products that are displayed in the very small space which there is for a display.  </p><p>Furthermore, the supermarket only knows the sales that it makes. It orders an inventory, it brings that in, it knows the specific sales it makes, it may have information about the customers that it sells to. Whereas Amazon takes in a great deal more of proprietary information. In the same way that a distributor--a national or global distributor does. Again, it's not quite like a distributor either. But I recommended the testimony and I've recommended in my book, the case for the Digital Platform Act which is available on Amazon.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>That--that which as I point out is not hypocrisy, it just proves my point.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But that there are many situations that we have like this such a shippers and telephone companies where we have rules that govern this. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: My time--well Ms.--my time expired. I'm sorry.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>If not, Mr. Chabot is going to be--then he's going to say that I am two parties in here. And I'm not so. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CHABOT: I would never--I would never say such a thing. Just to be clear-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--though, we did agree to that was about seven minutes so we get it. Okay. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: No, that's what I got. </p><p>CHABOT: Okay, thank you. Thank you.  </p><p>I'm going to ask Mr. Ward and Mr. Feld. Obviously, one of the things that Congress is considering is--you know, should we get involved relative to regulations of the tech--tech platforms and that sort of thing. And if--if we were on a scale say of zero to 10, zero being leave it as it is don't do anything, to 10 being a heck of a lot of regulations as much as is necessary. Mr. Ward, I don't know. Mr. Feld, I don't care who goes first but make your best argument as to where that number ought to be and--and why. So 10 is a lot of regulations. Zero is no more than we have now. </p><p>FELD: Well, I'd--I think you'd have to have as much as necessary. I mean, that's kind of like how high is up? I think that the current situation is an atmosphere that creates distrust by small businesses that creates situations where they can't resolve their problems, where very real problems are being created, where businesses are being hurt by accident, where--where the platforms are trying to do the right thing and can't because they involve complicated trade offs.  </p><p>So I think Congress needs to make a number of important decisions. I don't think that necessarily equals lots and lots of regulation. But I do think that it means that Congress needs to create an authority that's empowered to--you know, an umpire to call balls and strikes. That's not a lot of work, it's calling balls and strikes but it's pretty important to do. </p><p>CHABOT: Okay. Can you put a number on it? </p><p>FELD: No.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CHABOT: Okay. All right, Mr. Ward. </p><p>WARD: Two.  </p><p>CHABOT: Okay.  </p><p>WARD: I think that--I think in the life cycle of platforms and big--big tech companies we're in the Model-T stage. You know, this is just the beginning. We're seeing the market do what the market is supposed to do. We, frankly, are so far afield from what a real capitalism is supposed to look like. It scares us a little bit.  </p><p>I, on behalf of my members, reject out of hand the idea that small businesses distrust the platforms. I think that the vast majority of growth in the small business community is because they do trust the platforms. There is certainly a backlash against large tech companies over the last three or four years for reasons outside the perspective of competition. And there is sort of a triangulation around the idea of data and privacy and competition that is all coming together at once. And that's understandable and reasonable. And we should all dig into that.  </p><p>But I think historically, we know that one of the primary drivers of innovation in this country is not government intervention, right? What--what a Google and Amazon need to figure out better ways to service small businesses is not government bureaucracy.  </p><p>CHABOT: Okay.  </p><p>WARD: I also think the FTC would be a little insulted that we need somebody else to call balls and strikes. And lastly, regulatory capture is a very real threat if we go down this road. There is a continuing evolution in big tech, faster cycles than we've ever seen. That's just the nature of the universe that we live in now. Let's give the market a chance to catch up and surpass and reorder some of these companies before we have Congress do it. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you.  </p><p>Mr. Dufault, let me go to you next. I think you said you have about 5,000 apps in your organization or how many apps are there? I know that's a hard number to know. But do you have any idea how many there are out there?  </p><p>DUFAULT: In the major platforms, you have more than 2 million that are broadly available to the public. So there's going to be more than that. Those are the--I think that's the latest count for the Apple App Store and then the Google Play Store. So there are more than that. There are more than just those two platforms is the thing that we have to recognize. And many of our member companies are on Microsoft's platform. They're on App 47, which is an enterprise platform that most people don't think about because it's really just enterprise facing work. And so I'll point to that and say--you know, definitely over 2 million but it's--it's hard to count at this point. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you.  </p><p>If an ad or something pops up on your--on--you know, your iPad or your iPhone or whatever, is--is there an accepted size that the X is supposed to be on there and kind of--is there best practices? Or is there anything like that?  </p><p>DUFAULT: You're talking about ads-- </p><p>CHABOT: --It's really hard to find sometimes. </p><p>DUFAULT: The ads or you-- </p><p>CHABOT: You know, say an ad pops up and you--you want to get rid of the ad.  </p><p>DUFAULT: Right.  </p><p>CHABOT: And--you know, there's an X where you can X out and get rid of that. And look what you went on there to begin with. Is there an accepted size or is there a standard or? </p><p>DUFAULT: There are some standards. I know that the Digital Advertising Alliance, which is acts as a partnership of advertisers, tries to standardize the size and make sure that--you know, there's an opt in for advertisers so that you can provide that X. I think I know what you're talking about. It's a little blue X in the top right corner, right? </p><p>CHABOT: It's usually up there just to get rid of it if you want to.  </p><p>DUFAULT: Right.  </p><p>CHABOT: And along those lines, oftentimes, you're given two choices on this particular thing that you didn't go to that popped up. You know, it's either like, do it whatever it wants or do it later. Well, I don't want to do it at all. So they don't give you an option or there's no X. You know, I don't--I don't know that there's any regulations on that. But that's what I might just support the do something about that. </p><p>Let me go to you, Ms. Cavaretta. You--excuse me. I know you had your battles with--with Google. What--what, if anything, did they do? Did they offer to do anything? Did they--did you consult? Did you confront them? And if so, do you get any answer at all or? </p><p>CAVARETTA: In short, no, they have not approached me and they are not approachable. </p><p>CHABOT: You couldn't get them. I mean, basically, they're just--okay. </p><p>Mr. Hart, let me--let me go to--go to you next. You mentioned that I think you said 50 percent--is it 50 percent of sales basically goes to Amazon? Is--is that correct? </p><p>HART: Yeah, that's correct. If we sell $1 on Amazon, as of 2018, we pay 50 cents of that dollar to Amazon.  </p><p>CHABOT: Okay.  </p><p>HART: In 2013, it was 33 cents.  </p><p>CHABOT: Okay. And what services do you get in return for that? Do they break it down for you or what? </p><p>HART: Yeah, they absolutely--they absolutely do break it down for us. So the first thing is we pay a 15 percent Commission on every product that is sold on Amazon. For some of the products we sell, we pay Fulfillment by Amazon fulfillment fees. They range from $5 to $10. Depending on how heavy the item is, we pay a ton of money. As I recall, in 2018, we spent about $180,000 on sponsored advertising on Amazon that kind of works the way Google AdWords advertising does when you search, you'll see a sponsored product. We pay money in the form of storage fees, whole host of things when you add them all up at in 2018 added to about 50 percent.  </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Will the gentleman yield?  </p><p>CHABOT: I'll be happy to yield to the chair.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: So, Mr. Hart, that means was I correct or incorrect when I--I made the comment to Amazon that in order for a small business--a surge to show a--a custom--a--a small business product that if you pay ad then you will show up in the first page or second but not? </p><p>HART: Oh yeah, in--in 2019 at this point, it's enormously difficult to have your products appear on Amazon without paying Amazon for advertising. It depends it varies by category but if you do like a--a random search on Amazon, your top eight results in many cases will be advertisements, it will be advertised products. You go back to 2013, Amazon didn't even have advertising. So that's one of the ways that Amazon's expense share of our sales has gone from 33 percent to 50 percent. And I know you guys have a limited time but if I could, I'd love to respond to some of the questions and things that were said earlier. </p><p>CHABOT: My talks expired but--I'll yield back at this point. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Okay. The gentleman yields back.  </p><p>And Mr. (OFF MIC) is recognized for five minutes if and you will have two extra minutes if you want to listen or allow for the gentleman to be able to react. </p><p>EVANS: Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.  </p><p>I want to piggyback a little bit on the ranking member what he said between zero to the 10 and go by the previous person, I think it was Mr. Kennedy. And he raised the issue that it should be about the consumer and I haven't heard that. That's what I'm most concerned about is the consumer. So I heard one gentleman say two and I heard another one that didn't want to give a number. But how all does this relate to the consumer? I mean, that's--I mean, it's about credibility and integrity. So I'm hearing about the search engine, I'm hearing about--about the consumer. I mean, the consumer doesn't have the ability to have access to this information. So Mr. Feld and--and I'm interested in the other gentleman, I can't--Mr. Ward, I think it is. </p><p>FELD: This is--this is one of the big issues that makes the digital platform sector unique. It has what I call perfect asymmetry of information, meaning if I'm the user, I have no clue what's going on there.  </p><p>EVANS: Right.  </p><p>FELD: I have to trust. Now, one of the ways is if I start getting good search results--you know that they're relevant. And that's all--all fine. But the problem is when you're talking about from a business perspective, there are a lot of hotels that are relevant to me if I'm looking for a vacation in Maine. I don't happen to know what's the ideal one. And if somebody is paying, it's kind of like, if you're listening on the radio, I don't know if it's a payola thing where somebody's paying for play. Or if it's really that the DJ thought that was a cool song.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: Right.  </p><p>FELD: And that's why Congress passed a law that says--you know, no payola.  </p><p>EVANS: Right.  </p><p>FELD: You have to pay if it's being sponsored. So there's a similar problem here. There's just no way for the consumer to know and I agree with the Ms. Cavaretta that--you know, it's a real problem, that it's deceiving the consumer to some degree, if it's not factors that the consumer thinks the search ought to be based on. </p><p>EVANS: Mr. Ward, your response. </p><p>WARD: Yeah--sorry, the--the idea of consumer harm and again, I'm--I'm not a Lawyer but I'll play one on TV for a minute, is an FTC term I think it's Article V is the idea of price discrimination or deception, neither of which are particularly applicable when the product is free. Now it's true that free is a price--you know that you have to build into the idea that--that your search result has a value to somebody the same way it would if you were shopping for something else. But again, the market's going to do what the market's going to do. And we're taking for granted that this didn't even exist 23 years ago, when we wanted to go vacation in Ogunquit, we'd ask somebody that we knew that had been there. And that was the--the quality of the search that we could do.  </p><p>In this case, it doesn't take too many clicks to look at ratings, Yelp reviews, particular feedback from people that have actually been there, you can make a call or two all of that is accessible because of the investment that was made from these companies to give that power to us. If we're not willing to use it that's on us, not them. </p><p>EVANS: But even though I've--are you still holding to your position based on the ranking member of being a two when I add the aspect of the consumer? Because, remember, the consumer is trusting this information and the consumer doesn't really know. Because through marketing-- </p><p>WARD: --Sure-- </p><p>EVANS: --of this, advertised, the consumer makes the assumption that I'm getting the best. I'm gonna see what you--you wanted to say something too. So I got--I got about a minute and so you got to make it quick. I want to get over to this one. </p><p>WARD: I believe Ranking Member Chabot's question was on a scale of one to 10, how--how urgent is that the government get involved? And my answer was two-- </p><p>EVANS: (INAUDIBLE) correct--  </p><p>WARD: That's still. </p><p>EVANS: Even though--even though I asked about the consumer?  </p><p>WARD: Particularly.  </p><p>EVANS: Do you want to comment on that? </p><p>CAVARETTA: Thank you, Congressman Evans.  </p><p>I would say that if you looked at your search results, as a consumer, you had about 900 pixels that was going to be relevant to your organic search result and you're down to about 360, 390 that's organic and the rest of it in Google is now all pay to--paid product. That's a lot of real estate that's gone that they're making money off of.  </p><p>But--you know, just this past weekend, I can tell you that I had customers thought they booked on Booking.com and they did. But really, it came through another third party because they did site scraping and the customer had no idea that they had two middlemen in between their reservation or not. And what happens is, is they don't know who they've actually booked with. And that's a problem when they want to change the reservation, if it's a fly by night site, and that's happening often. I send about two cease and desist letters every summer to fly by night companies that are scraping off of sites and causing fake bookings. And that's a real problem and it's enabled by this environment where there's lack of clarity around those reservation buttons. </p><p>EVANS: I'll yield back the balance of my time. I want to say to you, Madam Chair, it does seem like the Wild West for the consumer.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Now, we're talking about the consumer who doesn't have the knowledge that we are seeing here and don't have a chance to hear the consumer looks like being trumped. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Since I allotted seven minutes for the gentleman, I will allow Mr. Hart and Ms. Cavaretta to react to any of the answers that were provided previously by the companies that were here. </p><p>HART: Just briefly, I think there's some narrow areas where Amazon has policies that do lead to consumer harm. This isn't an example of it but just to kind of frame the conversation. So we were talking about how I was paying 33 cents for every dollar in 2013. Now, it's 50 cents for every dollar in 2018. We've raise prices. So that's a little bit of consumer harm right there. But that's not an Amazon policy necessarily.  </p><p>Returning to the comments earlier, Ranking Member Chabot, you said that exports are important to you. And I obviously agree, everyone does. One really great way to solve that problem would be to bring equity to the Chinese e-packet situation and I can explain what that is, if you'd like. Basically it's just considerably more expensive for us to ship our products to the United Kingdom versus a seller in China considerably, like 10 times the cost and that inhibits our exports.  </p><p>Rep--Congressman Golden, you asked a question to Mr. Mehta about whether or not you need to store your goods in Fulfillment by Amazon. This isn't necessarily something that's unfair or bad. But in order to get sales, you absolutely do need to store your products in Amazon's warehouses in order to get that Prime check. The punishment for late delivery. Amazon makes late deliveries all the time, a lot of us are Prime members. It's probably happened to you. You can fight for like maybe a $5 promotional credit or something like that. We ship out of our own warehouse. If we're late, we can get suspended, which is rather a more onerous punishment.  </p><p>Now if Amazon is late, in some cases, you can like kind of add your way into a refund of some sort. This is another example of consumer harm and Amazon's very generous with how it refunds the consumer in that case but it turns out in a lot of cases, my company will be footing that bill. So they'll deliver our product late but we pay for the refund even though it wasn't our fault.  </p><p>Respectfully, Ms. Prodromitis, I know hundreds of Amazon sellers. And I--I would say that her view of the platform is more the exception than the rule. And I'd love to hear about how she sells her sponges on Amazon today in view of how much Chinese competition there is on the marketplace now. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Okay. If you have any--any reaction to any other question previously made. Otherwise, I will recognize the gentleman from Maine, Mr. Golden. We're running late here. Thank you. </p><p>GOLDEN: Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you, Mr. Hart, for--for weighing in on that. That's basically what I suspected and why they might be able to do it. I hope, sometimes that just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. And I think when consumers learn more and more about these things, some of them may make different choices and that's okay. But even having the ability to have that information and make those choices, I think is part of what we're--we're talking about.  </p><p>You know, I--I would just make a comment that--as you know, we have had conversations about government getting involved and--and whether or not people trust government to get involved and--and get it right. And absolutely, I think sometimes it's totally fair to say government doesn't get it right. Sometimes they do get it right. And--you know, one thing that I always hear from my constituents is a concern in particular about individual information. You know, we can talk about health care and other things, people's concerns about the government having control over individualized information.  </p><p>And when I think about some of the tech companies and--you know, some of these services, I think that the growing distrust out there in the general public is about this concern about information and who has control over it. Whether it's directly--you know, attached to them in their name or not people are becoming aware that there is a lot of information flying around about them. And there's, I think, a growing distrust and a lot of concern and people will, I think, over time looked to government for reassurances that they have protections. And I think that--you know, companies are going to have to come to grips with this and--and acknowledge that as they have growing power.  </p><p>And you know, as I listened to Ms. Cavaretta talk about some of the issues with--with her business. You know, I hear her talking about the fact that there is in addition to the relationship between her and the consumer, a growing kind of side market, that consumers are not even aware of in terms of another level of revenue being introduced in--into the relationship. But even beyond that there's another almost side market, which is the trafficking of people's data and information, which also a lot of these companies are--are harvesting and using to go out and make money. And I think that consumers are aware of that and concerned about it as--as well.  </p><p>So I think--you know, there is a responsibility to do oversight. And at the end of the day, thinking about consumers, what we need to be able to talk about is transparency, which is what Ms. Cavaretta and a lot of other people are talking about.  </p><p>You know, these are really amazing--you know, things that you said. They--they help a lot of small businesses. None of these business owners would be using these platforms if that wasn't the case but they also have a right to express their concerns and seek for--for options and to have a voice which is what the point of Congress is at the end of the day. You know, I love this phone right here.  </p><p>A good partner of mine back home, Chamber of Commerce--Maine State Chamber of Commerce, I love to work with them, love to work with their members, Lewis and Auburn Chamber of Commerce where I come from, I can go on to their website, do a quick scroll search, see who all their members are, have a--you know, a really helpful platform there where I can reach out and say, \"All right--you know, I want to find a local brewery,\" or something along those lines, get connected with that business. It's a great service and a great nonprofit. So just a little bit of helpful feedback.  </p><p>Mr. Ward, I'd love to have more information. I'd love to know who I'm talking to, who's sitting before me, I checked out your website, clicked on your membership page, it just gave me the opportunity to sign up as a member. Perhaps I'll consider that or have my family small business think about that. But I would just say we'd love to know more about the tens of millions of small business owners that you do represent and I think that--that is helpful information for members of Congress to know.  </p><p>And just with the remaining time I have, Ms. Cavaretta, I know that you were indicating you had more said. </p><p>CAVARETTA: Thank you very much, Representative Golden. You know, earlier, we talked about misdirection and a little bit of the confusion that the consumer may have. And there's two sides to that. If you use that Google My Business listing as a hotel and you can now go down to the view rooms feature of which a hotel does--like mine does not have access to it drops you right to an OTA. So they're going to have access to that for six months and the consumer will be booking with them for six months before I will get that as the producer of the product at my family's business.  </p><p>And that is unusual to me to think that I cannot sell my own product on my own listing that's given to me for free by Google. And the consumer can't tell the difference except for a little tiny word. And so both they are misled and I am withheld from being able to access a way to sell on that product and platform that way. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentlemen yields back.  </p><p>Well, we want to thank all the witnesses for taking time to be here. I know that you all have a busy schedule, I really appreciate it. We have now heard from both large tech companies and small Main Street businesses about opportunities and challenges for entrepreneurs in the digital economy. As we continue to race towards innovation, we cannot forget the important role small firms play in our communities and our economy, toy companies beauty brands, family-owned, small businesses across all sectors rely on the internet and digital platforms to reach consumers and grow their businesses.  </p><p>However, when entrepreneurship continues to lag in the U.S., that means fewer jobs and less innovation. While we must ensure that there are protection for small businesses and consumers who enjoy the benefits of digital platforms, we must work diligently to develop policies that will also continue to foster innovative technology that has the power to continue to change our lives. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come up with bipartisan solutions to these issues.  </p><p>I will ask unanimous consent that members have five legislative days to submit statement and supporting materials for the record. Without objection, so ordered and if there's no further business to come before the committee, we are adjourned. Thank you. Thank you. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ2-T6Y1-F15W-H4GY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

JOHN JOYCE (R-PA.) </p><p>[*]VELAZQUEZ: Good morning. the Small Business Committee will come to order.  </p><p>Today's order of business is to consider the views and estimates of the community on small business for fiscal year 2021. These resources are a critical first step in helping entrepreneurs launch and grow their small business. The purpose of this meeting is to set our priorities and expectation for fiscal year 2021 to ensure the Small Business Administration has the funding necessary to modernize and strengthen the SCORE programs on behalf of America's entrepreneurs.  </p><p>While the economy has appeared healthy, much uncertainty remains now the waves the coronavirus outbreak. Just last week, the stock--the stock market launch, suffering some of the worst losses since the 2008 financial crisis. Small businesses throughout the country currently faced looming supply chain disruptions where consumer confidence is diminishing. As the virus spreads, it has the potential to significantly dampen global economic activity both here and abroad. With the threat to the economy more entrepreneurs and small business owners are looking toward the Small Business Administration and its many programs for help. SBA core programs ensure small employers and aspiring entrepreneurs have their counseling, financing and access to the federal marketplace they deserve.  </p><p>Ensuring this program has robust levels of funding. and operate effectively are a top priority for the committee. Today's views and estimates reiterate the committee's longstanding position to prioritize core programs like the Small Business Development Centers and the 7(a) loan program rather than expanding critical funding on untested agency initiated programs. To that end, the views and estimates proposal supports increased levels of funding for the entrepreneurial development programs, which provide free or low-cost counseling and training to nearly a million entrepreneurs each year.  </p><p>The committee acted bipartisan legislation last year to modernize their programs and maximize their effectiveness. fully funding SBA's entrepreneurial development programs will strengthen the SBA's ecosystem and allow SBA to provide viable counseling and training to me Small businesses. We must also ensure mainstream businesses have access to affordable capital, which plays a vital role in their success. Affordable capital is the key to unlocking opportunities to grow and create new jobs in the local economy and this proposal provides the requisite resources and funding levels to do just that.  </p><p>Finally, we have to work together to level the playing field in federal procurement opportunities for socially and economically disadvantaged business owners. We can achieve this through a greater emphasis on hiring more contracting personnel and providing them with adequate training in order to effectively assist small contractors competing in the $500 billion federal marketplace. The views and estimates we are proposing will breathe new life into the SBA. More importantly, it will provide tangible benefits to small businesses and make sure taxpayers get a positive return on their investment.  </p><p>At this point, I will yield to the ranking member Mr. Chabot, for any comments he may have on the committee's views and estimate. </p><p>CHABOT: I want to first thank Chairwoman Velazquez and her staff for, again, working in a bipartisan manner on the committee's budget views and estimates on the Small Business Administration's fiscal year 2021 budget. I appreciate her willingness to work collegiality as we meet our responsibilities to America, small businesses.  </p><p>The SBA and its programs can be essential to helping small firms expand, create jobs, and grow our economy. The SBA helps many small businesses to access capital, provides counseling and training, and links entrepreneurs with mentors. In this committee, it's our responsibility to provide our views and estimates to the committee on the budget to ensure that the SBA's programs are working efficiently And effectively on behalf of all small businesses all across this nation. We must insist that the programs are transparent and make the best use of taxpayer dollars.  </p><p>Every small business starts as an idea. America is a nation of creators and investors and risk takers. Our economy was structured to be driven by entrepreneurs and in fact, most net new job growth is from startups and new businesses, in fact, about 70 percent of the new jobs created in the American economy are created by America small businesses.  </p><p>We're fortunate to have the SBA's new administrator Jovita Carranza, to lead the agency into the future. She has a distinguished record, both in the private sector, as well as having been the Deputy SBA Administrator under President George W. Bush. We look forward to seeing her vision in action.  </p><p>The chairwoman and I very often agree but there are times when we don't fully agree, and thus, even though I will be voting for the committee's budget views and estimates, I'll--I'll also be offering a motion later to submit additional views and estimates from the minority members of--of this committee. And again, I want to thank the chairwoman for working in a bipartisan manner with us and both--both staffs working together very well. And I yield back. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman yields back and I thank him for his remarks.  </p><p>Are there any other members who wish to be recognized for a statement on the views and estimates of the committee for fiscal year 2021? Seeing no members, the committee now move to consideration of the views and estimates. The clerk will read the title of the document. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Fees and Estimates of the Committee on Small Business (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: --I ask unanimous consent that the views and estimate be considered as read and open for amendment in its entirety. Does any members seek recognition for the purpose of offering an amendment? Seeing no amendments, we will move on.  </p><p>And the question is on adopting the views and estimates on the priorities of the committee for fiscal year 2021. All those in favor say aye. Aye.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: Aye.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Those opposed, no. In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it--the ayes have it and the views and estimates are agreed to.  </p><p>I will now recognize the ranking member for the purpose of making a motion. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And I would move that the minority members of the committee be permitted to file additional views and estimates on the budget for fiscal year 2021. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Without objection, so ordered.  </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: And the committee's authorized to make technical and grammatical corrections to the views and estimates. We adjourned and the committee will stand in recess for a few moments to prepare for the committee hearing. Thank you. </p><p>(RECESS) </p><p>Good morning The committee will come to order.  </p><p>I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning, especially our witnesses for taking time to travel here to testify before our committee.  </p><p>The key to long-term growth in our economy is to make sure we're creating an environment that encourages innovation. That is why since last January, we have held hearings on how the digital ecosystem promotes entrepreneurship, how small firms are leading the way in the clean energy economy, and solutions to decrease barriers for women and minorities seeking patents and trademarks.  </p><p>Today's hearing is another topic I am excited to explore on how blockchain technology is being used to support entrepreneurship and small business growth. I know that when most people hear about blockchain they automatically think of cryptocurrency and bitcoin. Well, blockchain is the technology that enables this existence of cryptocurrency, by no mean is that the only use.  </p><p>As a member of the Financial Committee--Financial Services Committee, I have heard firsthand how blockchain technology is being utilized in payment processing by large banks and insurance companies. Today, we have an opportunity to hear from small businesses that are using blockchain technology to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, disrupt industries, and grow their businesses.  </p><p>As we all know, the internet, once the (INAUDIBLE) of hobbyist and cutting edge tech experts has grown into a mainstream driver of economic growth and efficiency. Yet much of the power of the internet is concentrated in a few multi-billion dollar companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, who gather large amounts of data on consumers and dominate marketplaces. In fact, many small businesses rely on these large corporations for advertising, eCommerce, distributing their products, cybersecurity, and cloud computing. Much like when a Walmart comes to town it is challenging for small businesses and entrepreneurs to compete against these massive corporations.  </p><p>Blockchain technology can help small businesses compete on a moral level playing field with larger corporations by streamlining operations, reducing reliance on costly third party intermediaries, and boosting cybersecurity networks. By developing or deploying blockchain effectively, that technology can have a positive financial impact on small businesses.  </p><p>Over the last decade, there has been a frenzy of investment and entrepreneurship around blockchains. Innovators and small businesses are at the forefront of a wide variety of blockchain-based technological applications in nearly every sector of our economy, including healthcare, the clean energy sector, financial services, transportation, and logistics. The International competition has begun. Many other countries have invested in blockchain research and initiated coordinated frameworks. Congress must do our part to make sure that the United States remains a leader--a leader in blockchain development and engagement.  </p><p>Because blockchain technology has a wide variety of applications, there are a number of federal agencies that have been looking at the uses of blockchain technology, including the SEC, the CFTC, and even the IRS. However, many of these efforts are not coordinated between agencies, leaving uncertainty for businesses and entrepreneurs. We must make sure that the federal government adopts policies that support blockchain technology as it becomes a driver of wider economic growth and efficiency.  </p><p>There is a need for a coordinated framework to balance the need for regulation while still supporting innovation and providing quality and predictability for businesses and entrepreneurs. Today's hearing is a chance for us to go beyond the hype to understand the benefits and challenges of blockchain technology. Our panel today represents a diverse set of expertise and viewpoints that will provide insight into some of the areas where blockchain is having an impact on small businesses. I look forward to the testimony and discussion.  </p><p>I will now like to yield to the ranking member, Mr. Chabot, for his opening statement. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.  </p><p>Technology is continuously being developed to meet the needs of a rapidly changing world. From the development of the assembly line, to the credit card, to the virtually universal use of the internet, businesses are continually adapting to the world around them in order to remain competitive and provide for their customers. Businesses embrace technological advancements in order to reduce costs, streamline processes, increase productivity, and maximize customer satisfaction.  </p><p>Though technological advance announcements may be difficult for some to learn and adopt our most innovative minds are searching for ways to do better. Our free market thrives on this continued innovation. Blockchain technologies are one of the newest advancements with the potential to create a positive impact on businesses, consumers, and our economy. It's important to examine this growing field in order to learn more about the potential security benefits and cost reductions.  </p><p>Of course, as with all new technologies, we must be aware of any potential challenges that could adversely impact individuals or businesses, especially small businesses. Today, we'll hear what the complex world of blockchain technology has to offer our small businesses and gain a broader understanding of the benefits and challenges associated with this technology.  </p><p>I want to thank the chairwoman for holding this hearing and for inviting one, in fact, two witnesses from America's greatest state, Ohio.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So thank you I yield back. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman yields back.  </p><p>And if committee members have an opening statement prepared we would ask that they be submitted for the record.  </p><p>I would like to take a minute to explain the timing rules. Each witness gets five minutes to testify and each member gets five minutes for questioning. There is a lighting system to assist you. The green light will be on when you begin and the yellow light will come on when you have one minute remaining. The red light will come on and that means that the time is out and we ask that you stay within that time-frame to the best of your ability.  </p><p>I would now like to introduce our witnesses. Our first witness is Mr. Shane Bigelow, the CEO of Ownum, Ownum company's CHAMPtitles and vital chain aim to bring more efficiency to vital records by converting paper based processes to digital formats using blockchain technology. Prior to joining Ownum, Mr. Bigelow was a senior vice president and managing director at Bernstein, where he managed U.S. business and served on the firm's Responsible Investment Committee. Thank you for being here.  </p><p>Our second witness is Ms. Dawn Dickson. Ms. Dickson is the CEO of PopCom, an automated retail company that uses blockchain to help collect customer insights. As a serial entrepreneur with over 16 years of experience in marketing and business development, Ms. Dickson launched four successful companies since 2002. Her most recent ventures include Flat Out of Heels and PopCom. Thank you for your testimony and for being here today.  </p><p>Our third witness is me Mr. Marvin Ammori. Ammori, the General Counsel of Protocol Labs. Protocol Labs is a research development and deployment institution for improving internet technology. Using an open source approach to creation. Protocol Labs focuses on building systems and tools to improve how the internet works. Mr. Ammori is a leading first amendment lawyer and internet policy expert. Prior to joining Protocol he was a legal fellow at the New America Foundation, an affiliate scholar at Stanford Law School, and law professor at Nebraska. He was also the head lawyer for Free Press, and has been a leading legal advocate in advancing network neutrality. We appreciate you being here today.  </p><p>And now, I yield to the ranking member, Mr. Chabot, to introduce our final witness. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.  </p><p>Our final witnesses Jim Harper. He's not one of our two Ohio witnesses but he's still pretty good.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Mr. Harper is a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, AEI. Before joining AEI he worked at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Cato Institute. Previously, he served as counsel for the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on commercial administrative law, and his counsel for the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Mr. Harper received his BA from the University of California, Santa Barbara and his JD from University of California Hastings College of Law and we welcome you here this morning, Mr. Harper. We welcome all the witnesses. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Mr. Bigelow. Now, you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>BIGELOW: Good morning. Chair Velazquez, and Ranking Members Chabot and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to participate on this important topic.  </p><p>I'm Shane McCrann Bigelow, the CEO of Ownum. Today I'm appearing on behalf of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, as well as my company, Ownum, to offer our specific experiences in starting a small business that improves the lives of consumers by providing quicker and more efficient access to vital records and enhances public safety in doing so.  </p><p>In the United States, our vital records are used to demonstrate ownership, citizenship, birthright, and much more. However, acquiring these important documents is cumbersome because these records are largely paper based. For most Americans, this is an annoyance at best and debilitating at worst. For the poorest in our nation, a group disproportionately tilted towards minorities, vital record acquisition and maintenance can represent the worst in life.  </p><p>From a mother who was trapped in an abusive relationship with her husband because he is holding her and their children's birth certificates and other important documents hostage, to a title loan store that is pressuring a downtrodden individual to relinquish his or her vehicle title in exchange for an exceedingly high interest rate loan, vital records are regularly at the epicenter of physical and economic disadvantage in our most vulnerable communities.  </p><p>Further, our government process today requires consider paperwork, and more importantly, time spent in DMV lines or Department of Health lines in each state in our union. This requires time away from employment and is an event that requires transportation, something that studies indicate our porous communities lack in quality form and much of our nation. It could easily be said, that the process to acquire vital records in this country is discriminatory.  </p><p>The question, of course, becomes why in this age of technology where we have an abundance of cell phones and readily available internet access, do we still require such antiquated processes as filling out paperwork, spending hours in long lines, and physically showing up at convenient locations, all while missing work? We have failed to become fully digital because there's been no incentive to change.  </p><p>The ecosystem around vital records, banks, insurance companies, hospital systems, et cetera, have accepted the legacy process of using paper as a cost of doing business. That was acceptable 20 years ago when our technology could not fully support a digital process but that is unacceptable today. At Ownum we aim to change all of that. Ownum is a holding company that was started by Bernie Moreno and me approximately two years ago. Under Ownum other companies were created, each with a similar goal. That goal is to digitize a particular vital record and the process to acquire it. No paper anywhere, anytime.  </p><p>Our first company is CHAMPtitles, which can be found at CHAMPtitles.com, where we're digitizing vehicle titles. The second company is Vital Chain, found at VitalChain.com, which is digitizing birth and death certificates. Each uses blockchain technology to improve accuracy, efficiency, and fight fraud.  </p><p>Ownum's use of blockchain technology is why we were invited here--invited to be here today. But sadly, the use of blockchain is often at the source of the most confusion and biggest delays for government. Unlike in the 90s and 2000s, when government promoted business and fostered the internet boom, today our governments seem to be doing the opposite with anything related to blockchain.  </p><p>This is where this committee can be of great help to any small business or startup working with blockchain technology today. If state governments were encouraged to pursue digitization, like what the IRS did when they allowed a multitude of vendors to replace paper tax filing with digital filing, that would be a great step forward. The states needed an incentive to allow vendors like us to send in and transact, completely in digital form, the information they currently acquire and transact in paper form.  </p><p>Ideally, the outcomes Ownum seeks are as follows.  </p><p>Help the poorest in our country to gain better access to their vital records in a secure way by encouraging federal and state governments to allow for the digitization of not only their vital records, but the process to acquire them.  </p><p>Use this committee's paper reduction authority to promote the digitization of paper-based vital records at the state and federal level in areas where government services are involved.  </p><p>Provide financial aid to small businesses seeking to provide a digitization of records, incentivize state governments to adopt digital is vital records, and affirm publicly that the Federal eSign Act applies across all 50 states to blockchain technology and other emerging tech.  </p><p>By recommitting, as we did during the internet boom, to focus our government at all levels on what a technology enables, we will help our government to pursue digitization strategies for vital records. Doing so will enable many small startups and small businesses like us to build the next generation of the innovative and entrepreneurial culture in America today.  </p><p>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Bigelow. Now, Ms. Dickson, you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>DICKSON: Thank you, Chairwoman, Ranking Member and the members of the committee. It is an honor to be here today to represent the Great State of Ohio.  </p><p>I am Dawn Dickson, a small business owner for 20 years. I am what most call a serial entrepreneur. I am driven and passionate about business ownership and identifying resources to move my companies forward. Like many small business owners, I have benefited greatly from SBA programs, including SCORE and Bixel Exchange. In 2016, I won $20,000 in the SBA InnovateHER Challenge, and last year I won $125,000 in the MEDA Million Dollar Pitch Competition that is also SBA funded.  </p><p>I own for small businesses, but today, I'll focus on one, PopCom, where I'm leveraging blockchain technology for specific aspects of my business. PopCom is a B2B tech startup that develops software and IoT connected hardware for self service retail. This includes vending machines and digital kiosk used to dispense products and perform transactions. At PopCom were using blockchain to optimize machine driven transactions for government regulated products that require identity verification, self-compliance, supply chain information, or combination of all three. There's a tremendous opportunity in this space. Over $3 trillion in global revenue growing to $5 trillion by 2022.  </p><p>I want to clarify that PopCom is not a blockchain company. We are a technology company that uses facial recognition and artificial intelligence in our software. I am simply using specific blockchain applications for my business. This is an important distinction.  </p><p>Blockchain is not a silver bullet, however, it can solve problems that small businesses face. Instead of building our own proprietary product, we partner with Civic a--excuse me, a secure blockchain identity management platform to age gate customers, to execute purchases of regulated products. such as alcohol and cannabis, from a vending machine.  </p><p>As a company, we believe the most secure way to check and confirm a customer's identity, while ensuring their personal data remain secure. is to have the customer verify their information on their mobile device and store that data on the blockchain. We never collect or have access to any of their personal data. We know nothing about or from the customer and that is the power of blockchain.  </p><p>Blockchain is more than a business tool, it can also be leveraged for fundraising. I know firsthand the challenges that small businesses face when raising traditional and nontraditional capital. In 2016, after I won the SBA InnovateHER Challenge, I still could not qualify for an SBA loan, despite already generating revenue and having excellent credit history. Federal programs are ineffective if they are not accessible to the very small businesses they are created to empower.  </p><p>In 2018, I made the tough decision to turn down $1.5 million in VC investment because that would have meant giving up over half of my business ownership. After we completed our seed round, bringing our funding to close to over a million dollars from Angel VC, I decided to do a secure token offering to raise capital and to give people in my community the opportunity to invest in my business. Blockchain technology made this possible through the tokenization of my cap table. A token represents a digital share stored on the blockchain and is--it is treated no differently than a traditional stock certificate. However, the token is proof of investment that lives on the blockchain ledger forever and can't be erased or retracted. This gave people comfort and security knowing that their money is safe. </p><p>In 2019, I became the first female CEO globally to raise over a million dollars using equity crowdfunding under Title 3, reg CF of the JOBS Act. I leverage my personal network to raise capital through the STO, instead of relying solely on VC and angel investors to fund my business.  </p><p>Access to capital for small businesses has come a long way from the start of my first company in 2001. However, more needs to be done to increase this access in order for entrepreneurs to continue to grow, bring products to market, and create jobs. Congress is in a position to address these issues and this committee can lead the way.  </p><p>There are few financial institutions that will capitalize enterprises that are using blockchain. The National Policy Network of Women of Color and Blockchain has developed a legislative proposal to create a federally backed SBA 7(a) loan for entrepreneurs and small businesses who are using blockchain technology. This unique SBA 7(a) loan could help level the playing field for all businesses. Congress should consider blockchain and cryptocurrency as a part of the solution and advance policies that will benefit small business owners like me. I hope you continue to engage diverse voices as you deliberate legislative priorities to ensure entrepreneurs can innovate, build, and grow right here at home.  </p><p>Again, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on behalf of the millions of constituents across the nation that this committee is tasked to empowering.  </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Thank you, Ms. Dickson. Mr. Ammori, now you're recognized </p><p>AMMORI: Thank you, Chairwoman Velasquez, Ranking Member Chabot and other members of the committee for inviting me here today.  </p><p>I'm Marvin Ammori, testifying on behalf of the Blockchain Association. I head legal and policy at a member company called Protocol Labs. Protocol Labs was founded in 2015 and now has more than 117 employees and contractors across 36 states and 16 countries. This year, my company plans to launch the Filecoin Protocol, which is software designed to create a vibrant marketplace for online data storage and blockchain technology is one key enabler of that marketplace.  </p><p>So let's begin with blockchain technology. When you cut through the hype a blockchain is essentially a data structure. So think of a database, a ledger, or a spreadsheet. Now, why is there so much hype for a better spreadsheet? Because the blockchain stays up to--up to date and in sync based on software rules and community agreement. So one person or one company does not choose how to update the entries in the spreadsheet, rather all or a specific number of computers in a network will agree to make the update together. So you might prefer a blockchain instead of a traditional database or ledger if you'd rather trust a consensus of multiple actors versus trusting one single record keeper. So that simple.  </p><p>So the invention of blockchains can affect industries far beyond money listed in a ledger, including healthcare, supply chain, vital records and anywhere else you would want multiple people making a consensus, including enabling competition in internet infrastructure, such as services like cloud storage. So the Filecoin Network will be a marketplace for buying and selling cloud storage.  </p><p>For decades, computer scientists and law professors have written about the resilience benefits of a programmable, efficient market for storing data, where people who have extra hard drive space on their phone or in their data center could rent that storage securely and efficiently to others who wanted access to that storage. Our software will be open source and anyone will be able to download it for free to broadcast their desire to buy and sell hard drive space. In the Filecoin Network a blockchain will record the storage market transactions. As a result, nobody will be needed as a middleman, including us, to manage the marketplace. Anyone can rely on software rules and underlying mathematics for the marketplace.  </p><p>So how can Filecoin and the blockchain underlying it benefit small businesses? First, creating a marketplace in online storage may drive down the cost of data storage to the real costs for almost every business in every sector. Businesses need reliable and secure places to store data as much as they need electricity. And many of them pay cloud storage providers to hold and serve that data from their data centers. If Filecoin drives down storage costs through enabling more competition, small businesses will save money, which they can invest in jobs and R&amp;D. Further, more small businesses would be able to afford the digital file cabinets needed to innovate in data hungry new fields, such as virtual reality, healthcare imaging, and artificial intelligence.  </p><p>Second, and just as importantly, Filecoin will enable small businesses to compete directly in the cloud storage market. Today, Amazon is the largest provider of cloud computing through its Amazon Web Services Division. This is actually Amazon's biggest business, accounting for more than two thirds of Amazon's operating income with high margins. We hope that an open storage marketplace can help all the smaller and midsize players to compete more effectively, not based on brand recognition or large enterprise sales teams, but by competing on cost, speed, and security.  </p><p>We are not the only company using blockchain data structures to create open marketplaces for internet infrastructures, which we hope will decrease the power of today's large internet platforms and some would say decentralize the internet. Others include new browsers, privacy protective advertising exchanges, the video encoding marketplaces, identity solutions, such as mentioned by Ms. Dickson, and highly distributed computing. </p><p>In some blockchains or novel data structures, they may be useful in many industries where multiple players prefer collectively updating records instead of relying on one central updater. One of those many industries is internet infrastructure, including our project, which we hope will benefit many small businesses and there are many other use cases.  </p><p>Thank you. I look forward to your questions. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Ammori. Mr. Harper, you're now recognized for five minutes. </p><p>HARPER: Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Chabot and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today, despite my woeful lack of Ohio roots.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>When I was counsel with the House Judiciary Committee in the latter part of the last century, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a--a lot of small business committee staff so I have a--a lasting affection for the committee. I don't think any of those folks are still here but I'm glad to see consistency in the leadership.  </p><p>I'm Jim Harper, Visiting Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and Senior Research Fellow at the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law. Since I left the House in 2000, I've been a student of technology, including blockchain and cryptocurrency since 2011. In my time, I came to believe that you really have to understand the technology fairly deeply to gather what the consequences of the technology are and what might come from any regulatory intervention.  </p><p>So my written testimony is fairly heavy on blockchain as a technology, the processes by which blockchains are created and the use of cryptocurrency in some cases to secure blockchains, such as when there are higher value uses or larger scale blockchain applications. I'm going to spare you that lecture here today. You should be happy to know that and--and I'll skip to the consequences that I perceive for--for small businesses.  </p><p>You've heard from my co-panelists about specific implementations that--that illustrate the benefits of blockchain. I perceive them breaking down into three categories. One already mentioned is simple efficiency. Blockchains may allow various business functions to be conducted at lower cost on the theory that each dollar saved is more precious to a small business than it is to a larger business. I think that's a distinct and important benefit for small business.  </p><p>Second, blockchains may allow for diversified and open market structures that support more niches and specialties. Because I like the example so well, I focused on my--in my written testimony on an effort called beefchain. Along with saving on costs and losses when meat supply may be tainted, a beefchain may allow small producers of specialty meats to--to serve national markets. What a boon for small businesses and consumers who might enjoy greater options than what's available through commodity meat production.  </p><p>Finally, I think blockchains may reduce the--the competitive advantage that large businesses have in the world of data. This relates pretty well, Chairwoman Velazquez, to the reference you made to the bigger players in--in tech right now. Large companies, not only in--in tech, but--but throughout industry, have the resources and heft to set data standards for their industries. These standards may benefit the large industries themselves. And of course, they have access to more data about markets, products, customers, and so on.  </p><p>Blockchain can bring large communities together to create data commons, unknown non proprietary stores of data. These projects are more likely to have data structures that serve all use cases, including the uses of small business and they may give small businesses access to data that they did not previously have. This would give them the ability to use advanced analytics and make other uses of data that are now reserved only to bigger businesses. So blockchain may lower barriers to entry and innovation.  </p><p>My friends in the cryptocurrency world may pooh-pooh the benefits of mirror blockchain if the larger cryptocurrency projects may have world-changing consequences, and that's exciting stuff. But I think about it this way, the internet, when it came along, became an amazing tool for communication. When I left the Hill 20 years ago, I don't think even I imagined that we'd have video conversations on our handheld phones. I didn't think we'd have a language of emojis and gifts that--that we use. I didn't think I'd be able to keep in touch with high school friends from 35 years ago the same way I keep in touch with my neighbors. All that is because of the communication medium that the internet--that the internet created.  </p><p>Well, what the internet itself did for communication, blockchain and cryptocurrency may do for record-keeping an administration. That means big changes in how business and government are conducted. Big shifts in power, including, hopefully, lower power and fewer concentrations of power in society, including in those larger businesses. That's important, even if it's mostly still potential.  </p><p>There will be a lot of consequences to sort through. One could argue that the challenges we face in online privacy exist because the internet grew a little too fast for our society to absorb it. The net benefits are great though, and they'll continue to accrue. The same goes for blockchain and cryptocurrency, they hold out substantial benefits for all sectors of society in the world. You are wise as a committee to be examining this now and making this committee part of the process of ingratiating the technology into society so that we can get the benefits from blockchain while controlling the costs and the risks.  </p><p>Thank you, again, for having me here today. I look forward to any questions you may have with me or my co-panelists. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Thank you. Thank you to all the witnesses for the great insight that you have provided to us today.  </p><p>Mr. Bigelow, small businesses often rely on third party intermediaries, or middlemen, when conducting business, can blockchain help eliminate multiple intermediaries in certain industry, thereby ,increasing efficiencies and reduce costs for small businesses? </p><p>BIGELOW: Chairwoman, thank you very much for a great question. </p><p>So an example comes to mind from an experience recently that might shed light on how this could occur. So the short answer is yes. But take the example of I was in between meetings and I had to get from a meeting to an airport, as is commonly the case with my travel. So I--I couldn't take an Uber or a Lyft so instead, I arranged for a car service. And I was in the car and taking the car to the airport and I started talking to the driver, and I said, \"Oh, is this part of a--a fleet?\" He said, \"Oh, the--the owner started it and there's six or seven cars in the fleet.\"  </p><p>And I said, \"Oh, how often do you cycle through the vehicles?\" And he said, \"Well, more often than you think we put a lot of miles on them.\" And I said, \"Well, who takes care of that?\" And he said, \"Well, every time we have to sell the car the owner gets involved and he's got to go through the whole process.\" I said, \"Well, what sort of involvement does that require?\" He said, well, as far as I understand it, we sell three or four cars a year, and every time they do that they have to go down to the DMV and get--take the title, convert the title into the new owner or get the title from the lender if they just paid off the loan and they spend anywhere from three to Four hours either in line or getting to and from the location.\" And I said, \"Does the owner also drive the cars?\" He said, \"Yes, he's a crucial part of our fleet.\" I said, \"So for that--the totality of that time that owner is out of pocket.\"  </p><p>And if you think about it, the owner probably makes somewhere in the neighborhood of $50,000 to $60,000 a year. If you presume that the cost of that time is anywhere from three to four hours per instance, and there are five--or three or four instances per year, it's very easy to equate that to somewhere in the neighborhood of about $500 or $600 per year. That's 1 percent of their earnings. That's, effectively, a tax on that individual with blockchain as the intermediary, immediately the card title can be shifted from the bank, back to the owner, the owner can then give it to somebody else. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Are there any industry where this can have the most impact? </p><p>BIGELOW: Well, it's self-serving for me to say, but I believe there are two places. Around car titles the example wasn't by accident. This is the last hanging fruit that exists right now in a place where the government can be helpful. Any place where there is a government-based vital record, if we convert that to a digital form it will help all of the businesses around it. Banks in particular and insurance companies as well are particularly burdened with the cost of titles today. So vehicle titles is the first place. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Thank you.  </p><p>Ms. Dickson, for all small businesses improving customer service is critical for success. How is blockchain technology being used by small businesses to learn more about their customers? </p><p>DICKSON: Thank you, Chairwoman, for the question. And what comes to mind immediately is our use of blockchain for identity management when we use facial recognition. So as you know, face recognition is becoming very big across multiple industries and everywhere in the world, really. And on our vending machine platform we offer face recognition to understand the customer demographic profile, so understand male, female, your approximate age, and your engagement rate.  </p><p>However, the privacy concerns around are you taking that person's identity data and using that for anything that has been a big concern and that is why we utilize the blockchain so that when we do need to confirm that identity for a regulated product or for a, you know, prescription or alcohol, that we can verify they are a confirmed identity of age and able to purchase that product but never take their identifying information. So-- </p><p>VELASQUEZ: --Thank you.  </p><p>DICKSON: Okay, yes.  </p><p>VELASQUEZ: I--I don't have much time left and I would like to ask a question to Mr. Ammori. So do you believe that blockchain, the use of blockchain by a small firm, will level the playing field, allowing them to compete against the big tech, Amazon-- </p><p>AMMORI: --Yeah, Madam.--  </p><p>VELASQUEZ: --Google.  </p><p>AMMORI: Well--well, that's--that's definitely our hope. And I think it's the--the hope of several large investors in the country, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, essentially, have a thesis around using cryptocurrency and blockchain to compete with a large platform. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Thank you.  </p><p>And new industry allow policymakers to--the opportunity to put in place rules and guidelines designed to increase equity and diversity. What can be done to ensure that communities of color and women are leaders in this industry and we do not end up with an old boys club that exists in sectors like the financial sector? Yes, sir. </p><p>AMMORI: Well, I--I think there's a whole range of different initiatives that--that would cut across all venture capital. One, I--I think one thing would be to reduce the--the general risk around cryptocurrency and blockchain. There's several good rules that are being proposed, including tax fairness and clarity around securities. But I think if you reduce the risk you'll get more money in and that will go across the entire diverse American economy. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: My time has expired. Thank you so much. The ranking member is recognized. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, Madam Chair.  </p><p>And I'll begin with you, Mr. Harper. What, if any, challenges are there that may be discouraging or preventing any small businesses out there from adopting blockchain technology?  </p><p>HARPER: Well, there--there are many across--across a wide range. There's a lot of uncertainty. Blockchain and cryptocurrency sort of category busting. They don't fit into the old boxes. I think the--most of the agencies are doing a--a creditable job of trying to figure out how old rules apply, and it's generally the case is--that--is that old rules probably apply and they just have to figure out exactly how there's little--little gaps where there might be challenges.  </p><p>But the--the lack of certainty around how existing regulation applies to various blockchain applications is probably a hindrance. Even today, I think the IRS is holding a--a session to--to, hopefully, do better on how it categorizes and how it works with--with cryptocurrency. So the--the value of cryptocurrencies. There are ways it's done right, which is establishing pretty much that cryptocurrencies are property and you get capital gains if you--if you sell it again. And there are other cases where it's sort of missed and--and doesn't fit well with the technology. So there's a--a lot of--of-of certainty that needs to grow up around blockchain and cryptocurrency so that people can move forward confidently. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you,  </p><p>Mr. Ammori, somewhat related to the question I just asked, is blockchain ready to be fully embraced, would you say are there still areas that should be worked out before mass adoption? </p><p>AMMORI: I--I think it's--it's ready. I think some of the areas that need to be worked out on the technical side is we really need to improve user interface and usability so that all small businesses could use it. On the legal side, as Mr. Harper mentioned, the tax treatment at the moment's very complicated. If you wanted to spend bitcoin on a coffee this morning you'd have to keep track of what you paid for the bitcoin and how much it was worth the moment you spent it and pay the capital gain or loss on every single transaction. Doing your taxes for crypto is the worst nightmare.  </p><p>And so if we could up--if we could have a de minimis tax exception, which has been proposed the Virtual--the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act. I think all of us should support that. And then we should also have a little more clarity around the CFTC role, versus the SEC's role and they're both trying very hard but more certainty would be very helpful. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you very much.  </p><p>Ms. Dickson, did you make the right decision in turning down that $1.5 million from the venture capital fund? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I hope the answer is yes.  </p><p>DICKSON: --Yes. I appreciate Ranking Member's question. </p><p>CHABOT: If so tell us about it. </p><p>DICKSON: No, it was--it was an excellent decision because it allowed me to let other investors from around the community invest. So in the case of venture capital, that's one fund or a few funds that come together, and they are credited and they're already wealthy and they can invest. But using a STO would allow to leverage friends, family, peers, social media, the community, our--our customers, to invest at as low as $250. So instead of having two investors in a round, or three, we have 2,200. But the way that it's structured with the--with the token it's that is considered as like a syndicate so it was only one line item on my cap table. So it was a great decision.  </p><p>CHABOT: Great. Thank you.  </p><p>Mr. Bigelow, you mentioned the auto title function and the chair mentioned some other businesses. Are there some other governmental agencies or--or functions that--that you could envision that either at the local level or state level or at the federal level that you think would make sense for, you know, for--for your technology that you've described? </p><p>BIGELOW: There are. So you know, expanding on auto titles, that has an impact on not only the banking industry and the insurance industry when it comes to total loss, but it also has an impact on the way consumers can use that asset. to either acquire alone or some other purpose that it might have in their--from the standpoint of their own value that they have as assets.  </p><p>But birth and death certificates are another great place to go. If you think about the example in my opening testimony, we do have a problem in poor and minority communities where those assets are very difficult to come by and the time that spent to acquire them often leads to missed work, and sometimes can even lead to someone losing their job because they weren't there. It's a disproportionate tax on that person because the time they have to spend in line cost them much more as a percentage of their income than it does for someone maybe on this panel, any of us on this panel, to actually spend that time in the line. And so the--that is a place where if the government looked and said, \"You know, we should be digitizing all of our paper-based assets that are vital records.\" That would be a great use of time and a great benefit to society. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you very much. Madam Chairwoman, my time's getting ready to expire so I'll yield back. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: The gentleman yields back and now we recognize the gentlelady from Kansas, Ms. Davids. </p><p>DAVIDS: Thank you, Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Chabot, for holding this hearing. I know blockchain offers some pretty exciting possibilities for small businesses looking for security and autonomy and so I'm really glad we're getting the chance to focus on this today.  </p><p>We've seen some pretty fundamental security issues with the internet and privacy issues. Sometimes the small businesses are particularly vulnerable to these things. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about just what kind of protections implementing blockchain technology in small businesses could provide? And, you know, I'm particularly thinking just about personal data. And so there's--Mr. Bigelow, Ms. Dickson, you--you both have touched on whether it's facial recognition or our--our vital records if you could talk a little bit about the--the future of--of privacy protection there. </p><p>DICKSON: I'm happy to answer that question, Congresswoman.  </p><p>Again, just storing the data on the blockchain and allowing the customer to grant that access to whether it's a retailer or, you know, a--a doctor or the customer, the individual has control over the data. And that is how they can use the blockchain and a business case of blockchain even as far as managing human resources and any sensitive information about our employees or about our customer. So that's what comes to mind immediately is just, as Mr. Ammori talked about, that--that ledger, that secure database, that database that not one person controls, and that's really important as it comes to transferring data to multiple sources. </p><p>BIGELOW: And add to that, so, if you think about your data today, it is being used by the large companies that the chairwoman referenced in her opening comments. Blockchain offers a path, as Mr. Ammori mentioned, it's a ledger on which data can be stored. And because of the transparency often associated with public blockchains, you can see how that data is being used. In the public, or sorry, in the permissioned world, which is where my company spends most of its time, it's the protection around that data that's crucial. Blockchain is generally not the issue when it comes to security, it's the applications on top of blockchain where there are vulnerabilities that are created. Blockchain itself is tends to not be vulnerable. </p><p>DAVIDS: And then Mr. Ammori, I-I'd just like to follow-up because you mentioned earlier the--the need for probably an additional user, the UX, the user interface, and how do we make sure that people understand so if they have the ability to control the permissions or--or granting authorization, how far along are we in--in developing out, whether it's the apps that help people navigate that or the different businesses that are--that are moving in that direction? </p><p>AMMORI: There--there are--there are actually multiple attempts at the moment to do-to centralize identity or sovereign identity. I don't think there's--there's been a lot of uptake quite yet because I don't think we've solved the UX problems. But the--the question about security on the internet comes because when the internet was invented and created it was a set of open protocols anyone could use, right, the internet protocol, the transmission control, protocol SMTP, all these protocols for email and transmission, not--security was not built into the protocols of the internet. Identity was not built into the protocols of the internet.  </p><p>And so a few large companies came along and one of them kind of owns our identity on the internet, Facebook, right? Facebook has this giant database of all of our names and our friends and our relationships and--and--and it's controlled by one company. And if you could take that database and make it an open blockchain, where it's not controlled by one platform, but you could use encryption and authentication to identify yourself and instead of logging in with Facebook everywhere on the internet you could log in with Civic or some other blockchain application, you could actually take identity and make it open and not controlled by certain platforms and you could do the same with--with security as well. </p><p>DAVIDS: So Ms. Dickson, I know in your testimony you mentioned having participated - I don't want to get it wrong - as--as--with a delegation of 25 industry leaders to--to address blockchain issues. But and--and I know it was a--a women of color and blockchain congressional briefing. And I'm curious if you can tell me if you feel as though we have done, up to this point, a very good job or like what--what do we need to continue to do to make sure that we're opening those avenues up and--and hearing what's going on as it relates to small businesses and blockchain, particularly with women of color? </p><p>DICKSON: Thank you, Congresswoman. You know, you're doing it here today by giving us all the platform to be here and speak on it, by giving us the opportunity to hold that briefing in October. And just hear us, hear what we have to say, give us opportunity to share.  </p><p>So my position is showing the use case. Since we do not build blockchain, like, you know, my fellow panel members do today, we use it. The things that they are building we need and I'm here to be a voice for all of the companies that are really excited about what Mr. Bigelow is building and Mr. Ammori are building and waiting for us to be able to put those into practice. So by you doing what you're doing today, that you are doing enough and more of this definitely needs to continue. </p><p>DAVIDS: Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Gentlelady yields back and now the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Evans, vice chair of the committee is recognized. </p><p>EVANS: Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. </p><p>Ms. Dickson, I want to follow-up a little bit on some of the questions, for example, that's been raised with you. Like, what are the other benefits for businesses considering using ICOs and STOs to raise capital. </p><p>DICKSON: Thank you for your question. And speaking from this personal experience, the benefit for our company was to be able to have a wider pool of investors. You know, I live in--I live in Ohio. It's no secret, I'm a--I'm a black woman. And I went to the Ohio State University but that's not an Ivy League school. You know, I--I didn't go to school to be an engineer so my network was really concentrated from 20 years of being a business owner and the--and the reputation I built in my community. And I wanted to be able to leverage that--those relationships to raise capital and everyone was not accredited. And it came down to accredited versus the non--accredited investors.  </p><p>So the benefit of being able to use a secure token offering, which I did not do an ICO, I want to make a distinction between a secure token offering, which is legal under the SEC JOBS Act, title 3, and you can raise up to $1,000,070 a year, 1,070,000 a year under that way and it really allows businesses to leverage their--their networks, their personal networks, non-accredited investors. </p><p>EVANS: So do you think only certain types of businesses, such as tech businesses, for using our ICOs or STOs? </p><p>DICKSON: So, you know, the ideal type of business to raise capital in this way are high growth businesses. So of course, if it's a small business that doesn't have a 10 X potential or above, they definitely can look into many other funding that is available. There's also other types of crowdfunding that exist that are not, you know, inclusive of equity. So I would encourage businesses that have high growth potential to have the opportunity and the potential to return high investment yields to their investors so that those will be the ideal companies to do that.  </p><p>But it is an option for any business. However, the very extensive due diligence that's required, including financial reviews, including being compliant with many of the regulations around it, it's not a--it's not just a anybody can do it. So the SEC has definitely put things in place to make sure that the businesses are compliant, they are solid businesses and they have great potential. </p><p>EVANS: Do you have any concerns relating to the security of these type of exchanges? </p><p>DICKSON: Can you please clarify the question when you say exchanges, please? </p><p>EVANS: In other words, you talk about--you state that investors tokens cannot be sold because the SEC has not approved alternative trading exchange. Can you further--you know, in terms of they're approved? </p><p>DICKSON: Yes, sir. So, initially when raising the secure token offering, which 2018 was the first year that this was legal under the JOBS Act, it was with the understanding that after 12 month holding period the investors would be able to trade those tokens on an ATS and--and be able to get liquidity earlier and not have to hold them for maybe the standard 10 year period that a venture capital or an institutional investor would have to hold them. So since there has not been an--an ATS exchange approved yet for the trade of the secure tokens that companies like myself have done, the investors are still holding on to those tokens until that is approved by the SEC. </p><p>EVANS: Mr. Harper, you have several years of experience. What are your thoughts on the security of these exchanges and what the government can do to improve security? </p><p>HARPER: Well, the industry is young and its new and there are, unfortunately, a lot of businesses that are immature and actors that are immature, so it's right to be concerned about the security of exchanges just like the security of any application provider.  </p><p>The question that came earlier about the security of blockchains and applications I think is very important. One of the advantages that blockchain has, I think, is simplicity. Blockchains, although they're a little bit complex, are really ultimately rather simple. They're also open. That is, a lot of eyeballs can be on the software and the blockchain itself and that will cut down on security risks so it certainly doesn't eliminate them.  </p><p>So a lot of problem in the security has not been the blockchain itself but it's been the applications on top of the blockchain. Some of the smart contracts that people have tried to write to run on a blockchain-like aetherium there--there are a lot of things to work out in this area. And so I don't think people should rush in but be--be careful about the exchanges and about the applications that sit on top of any blockchain. Thanks for the question. </p><p>EVANS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Gentleman yields back. And I would like to go to a second round and ask some questions myself and then if the ranking member has any other questions will be recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>So I would like to ask this question to the panel. What condition--and Mr. Bigelow, you mentioned, right, that we should incentivize state government to use blockchain and to deal with some of the paperwork and so on. So my question to you is, what conditions are needed to help encourage the U.S. government to realize the economic potential of blockchain technology? </p><p>BIGELOW: So the--probably the easiest way to think through it is to look at examples. The Department Transportation this past winter reissued their statement on the federal domitor (SP) statement. And what they did was they clarified that that could be completely in electronic form. Now, you'd think that he eSign from years ago would have already clarified this, you might even think that their 2016 revision would have already clarified it. But because titles are done at the state level, the federal government had to be very clear with their one piece of paper that happened to be within the titling system, but was federal instead of at a state level, they had to be very clear How it could be executed at the state level.  </p><p>That clarity is particularly important. By being clear, now states are able to move to a more electronic process around odometer readings. Further, the focus was not on the technology, they mentioned blockchain as a valid path to go down for this electronic record. However, what they did was they focused on the function, not the technology itself. This is also indicated in the Chamber of Digital Commerce's a National Action Plan, where the real focus should be on function, not on technology. If our government can do that we'll--we'll--we'll unlock a lot of value that is currently right now unable to be unlocked because the clarity is not there because people are focusing on the tech and not the function. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Thank you.  </p><p>Mr. Ammori and Mr. Harper. </p><p>AMMORI: I'm not--I'm not sure if this directly answers your question but I--I believe that the U.S. government should embrace a digital dollar, especially if China embraces a digital renminbe. I think, you know, I think that'll happen China compete with their New Silk Road Initiative and all their investments in Africa. And I think if we care about the dominance of the U.S. dollar, we should really think about what other countries are doing as well. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Mr. Harper.  </p><p>HARPER: There are a couple of examples that I've come across of federal government agencies using blockchain, even just experimenting with blockchain, which I think has value because it'll familiarize people in the agencies with--with how block chains work. At--at the Treasury Department, if my recollection is correct, they're using blockchain to track devices. So someone's issued a--a phone or a computer by the agency, the software in the computer of the phone is--is programmed to check in from time to time whenever there's a login and say, \"I'm here. I'm in the possession of my--my employee, the employee that works for the agency. What a great savings over sending someone around person to person, to office to office to find, you know, 70,000 different devices as a physical matter.  </p><p>So that's--it's--it's not the superlative use of blockchain but it's the agency familiarizes itself the blockchain and they'll find uses that really take advantage of the Open Data capability of blockchain. That is, things that they can put on the blockchain and make open so that people can see how the government is operating. And see in real time what--what the functions of--of the government are. I think there's a real opportunity there for open government. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>DICKSON: Thank you. The only thing that I would add as a business owner is just making funding more accessible to small business that use blockchain and also making the--the barrier to entry easier for companies that would like to utilize token offerings. </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Thank you. Mr. Chabot. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, Madam Chair.  </p><p>I hesitate to ask this question but I will. Mr. Harper, you started out at the beginning saying that you weren't going to bore us with how this thing actually works technology wise. And as you notice, we've--this is being broadcast and there are probably tens of people out there watching.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And--and so--and so for that one guy that's out there at home or will see this down the road, that technology nerd or--or--or the lady that's out there watching this that understands who wants to - her mom she just said - how does it work in like just a couple of minutes if you--if you could? </p><p>HARPER: I like to--I like to say the same thing but a different way, I say figuratively thousands of people are watching. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>A block--think of a blockchain as an E-ledger. The blockchain name is kind of confusing. It might be--be forbidding to people. We can understand what email is. It's electronic mail. This is an electronic ledger. And it's a way that participants across the internet or any kind of community that--that's created by Mr. Bigelow's company or Mr. Ammori's, they come together and they post information that goes into a ledger. A block is essentially a ledger page. Cryptography and techniques that I'll insist on not describing here because I'll--I'll probably get it wrong. But my--my written testimony might be pretty good resource. People go to the Small Business Committee website and downloaded it there.   </p><p>Cryptography ties the blocks together and assures that they aren't going to be changed and it ties new blocks to old blocks. So you get a string or chain of blocks that become an authoritative record of whatever transaction or whatever event is recorded on the blockchain. So cryptocurrency, like the bitcoin blockchain, that is a blockchain that records transfers of this asset and you have an immutable record to last forever.  </p><p>Thanks for cryptography, it's highly secure. They are always attacks and--and concerns about ways that that immutable record could be--could be undermined. But there's pretty clever cryptography that secures the blocks in and of themselves and then secures the blocks together to make a chain. And it's kind of amazing, I think, to create a system for worldwide record-keeping. worldwide administration. It's not owned or government controlled. It's not corporate. It's not governmental. It's people getting together and deciding how to do things.  </p><p>So it might be identity. We all exist separate from our driver's licenses, honest we do-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--and--and there are ways of doing identity that can prove relevant things about you without giving away your eye color, address, height, and weight. If you need to prove that you're over 21, if you need to prove that you've passed a certain security check, you could do so at the airport, for example, without sharing who you are and where you're traveling. They could be assured that you are safe without getting a big record of where everybody's traveled. So there's a lot of potential out there. That's not the complete technical description but hopefully, it gives people a little further. </p><p>CHABOT: Very good. And you can tell your mom, you're welcome.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Thank you. I yield back.  </p><p>VELASQUEZ: The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Evans is recognized. </p><p>EVANS: You spoke about smart contracts in your testimony and I'm concerned about the--the legal implications of using smart contracts. Can you please speak to some of the legal issues such as jurisdiction with smart contracts that are essentially borderless? </p><p>HARPER: Yes to be.--I'll--I'll do a little bit of the technology behind smart contracts. A block captures events and--and transactions, generally, but smart contracts, such as on the Ethereum blockchain, the--the notations in the ledger are actually code that can--that can operate. And so in the--the example I give in my testimony is that, you know, a farmer might want some insurance against bad weather. They can set up a smart contract that grabs information from an oracle that is a--a reliable source so if there's bad weather during harvest season they get a payout that--that helps--helps compensate them for lost crops, that kind of thing. So it's--it's--it's really computer code planted in the blockchain. They will operate automatically to carry out whatever measure people--people decide they want to do.  </p><p>Smart contracts is actually a misnomer. It's just code. A contract is when two people enter into an agreement and they have to carry out that agreement one way another. The legal issues arise when someone decides not to or when they don't understand the terms of their agreement. This code executes the code, no matter--no matter what it is. Sometimes it goes badly and there have been examples of smart contract code going badly.  </p><p>The legal issues, and I might invite Mr. Ammori, also a lawyer, to--to chime in with others, the legal issues may include what the legal consequence of a given smart contract is in different jurisdictions. You could have someone in Asia enter into a smart contract deal with someone in New York and things go wrong. How does that--how is that going to get resolved in courts if the Asian party believes that their laws should apply and the New York party thinks that their laws should? In a way the internet and--and--but especially blockchain, kind of lifts things off of territorial jurisdiction and opens really difficult questions about what laws apply, if they can apply it all in--in these kinds of situations?  </p><p>So it's a great question and I have an incomplete answer, I'm pretty sure.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>EVANS: Yes. </p><p>AMMORI: Thank you for the question. So I think there are ways to address that issue. One, when it comes to a smart contracts, let's say, let's say you and I have a smart contract and if, you know, there's a crop damage because of whether you'll pay me some insurance. If that smart contract executes but there was something wrong with the deal or--or with--if there's a dispute, we could still go to the--the same courts or you could go to the courts, promise the money has already been prepaid.  </p><p>So if you believe in the Roman dictum that possession is nine-tenths of the law, right, you just have to--you're--you'd be the one who'd have to pursue the--the dispute versus me being the one who'd have to pursue the dispute and sue my insurance company, it might be the other way around. Right? So the--the legal system would still apply.  </p><p>And if you're dealing with a system where there's, you know, Chinese and African and American and Canadian people all using the same blockchain, you could, in theory, write into the code a choice of law provision. So all disputes regarding the smart contracts will be solved through an arbitration, right, if there's enough money involved. So there are ways to--to--to actually embed real law in the code that is the smart contract.  </p><p>But I agree with Mr. Harper, smart contract is kind of a misnomer. It's too highfalutin. It's just code. </p><p>EVANS: Thank you. I yield back. My time's out.  </p><p>VELASQUEZ: Gentleman yields back.  </p><p>Well, let me take this opportunity to thank all of you for your testimony and for helping to shed light on the numerous applications of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology's ability to streamline processes, promote transparency, increase security, and decrease costs, has the potential to transform the way we do business. As these technologies continue to develop worldwide we want to ensure that innovators and entrepreneurs have the opportunities to expand upon the enormous potential of blockchain technologies to support small businesses and spirit economic growth. It is coming clear that there is a role for both businesses and government in enabling innovation. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the opportunities and challenges facing the use of blockchain technology.  </p><p>With that, I will ask unanimous consent that members have five legislative days to submit statements and supporting materials for the record. Without objection, so ordered and if there's no further business to come before the committee, we are adjourned. Thank you. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCY-C5T1-JDPT-T1B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

I want to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon for this official remote hearing. I want to make sure to note some important requirements. Let me begin by saying that standing House and committee rules and practice will continue to apply during remote hearings. All members are reminded that they are expected to adhere to these standing rules, including decorum. </p><p>With that said, during the COVID period as designated by the speaker, the committee will operate in accordance with HR 965 and the subsequent guidance from the Rules Committee in a manner that respects the rights of all members who participate. House regulations require members to be visible throughout a video connection during the preceding, so please keep your cameras on. Also, if you have to participate in another proceeding, please exit this one and log back in later. In the event a member encounters technical issues that prevent them from being recognized for their questioning, I will move to the next available member of the same party, and I will recognize that member at the next appropriate time slot provided they have returned to the proceeding. </p><p>Should a member's time interrupted by technical issues, I will recognize that member at the next appropriate spot for the remainder of their time once their issues have been resolved. In the event a witness loses connectivity during testimony or questioning I will preserve their time as staff addresses the technical issue. I may need to reset the proceedings to provide time for the witness to reconnect. And finally remember to remain muted until you are recognized to minimize background noise. </p><p>In accordance with the rules established under HR 965 staff have been advised to mute participants only in the event there is an inadvertent background noise. Should a member wish to be recognized, they must unmute themselves and seek recognition at the appropriate time. Thank you. </p><p>Since February, the outbreak of COVID-19 has taken a significant toll on the entire U.S. economy. This crisis has hit America's small businesses especially hard. Three out of four small businesses have been experiencing a decrease in revenue since March, and an estimated 7.5 million small businesses are at risk of permanent closure as a result of this crisis.  </p><p>As members of this committee and as legislators at the federal level, we have a responsibility to secure funds to help America's small businesses survive this crisis. So far, Congress has allocated over $669 billion in grants and loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, also known as EIDL, and a new EIDL emergency grant program. From the onset Congress intended for the PPP and EIDL programs to provide immediate relief for--for small businesses to withstand the initial economic shock caused by this pandemic but as we approach August we cannot ignore the reality that the COVID-19 pandemic has morphed into much more devastating and extensive crisis that even some experts anticipated and the rhetoric coming from this administration downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 undoubtedly led many states to rush to open--to reopen ultimately exacerbating the problem.  </p><p>So we must be prepared with long-term solutions that will meet the magnitude of this crisis as we push forward to heal as a nation and find better days had. We can start by examining the policies adopted during and in the aftermath--aftermath of the great recession as a model moving forward. While we must recognize the inherent differences in these two devastating events for our nation, we must also remember that back in 2008 the outlook for small businesses was similarly uncertain.  </p><p>In response to the great recession, Congress stepped in and passed a series of bills that provided $1.2 billion for small businesses through the SBA lending programs. This critical step unlocked tens of billion dollars in guaranteed loans for small businesses that could not otherwise access capital when traditional credit markets froze. Policies enacted then prove to be critical--critical lifeline for thousands of small businesses in danger of closing their doors.  </p><p>At the same time, the Obama administration focused on how small businesses could help contribute to America's recovery by accelerating entrepreneurship and unlocking capital for the nation's smallest and youngest businesses. This money was well spent as small businesses were some of the largest contributors to job growth in the recovery, especially minority-owned and women-owned businesses who alone were responsible for the addition of 1.8 million jobs from 2007 to 2012. The nation's investments in entrepreneurship paid off as the United States some more than 550,000 new businesses open since 2011, and economy continue to grow.  </p><p>Because of the economic contributions from small employers and independent contractors after the great recession, it is imperative for this committee to explore those proposals and how we can modify them for the COVID-19 era. I also welcome any discussion of any new ideas brought to the table by members to address the challenges our small businesses are facing today. Whether it is utilizing traditional SBA programs or instituting innovative ideas, long-term recovery requires us to think out of the box but also come together in a bipartisan fashion to provide relief to small employers.  </p><p>As Congress works to explore additional ways to help America reopen and recover, I hope we continue to prioritize the smaller--smallest of small businesses, minority-owned and women-owned businesses the ones that helped build our nation the last time we found ourselves knee-deep in what felt like an insurmountable crisis.  </p><p>Again I want to thank the panelists for joining us here today, and I now yield to the Ranking Member Mr. Chabot for his opening statement. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for holding this hearing today. On this committee, we know how important small businesses and start-ups and entrepreneurs are to the economy; however, one of the consequences of this global pandemic is that our main streets are in very real danger of long-lasting damage or in the worst case permanent closure. Some have warned we could be in only the beginning of the worst wave of small business bankruptcies and closures since the great depression. We must be proactive and effective in our attempts to not only sustain but recover and expand the influence of America's small businesses and main streets all over the country. </p><p>Recent research from universities such as Harvard, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois, and others have found that some small businesses, especially micro-enterprises, may be the most susceptible to permanent closure. We must work together and listen to those like our witnesses here today who know and appreciate that critical segment of our economy. </p><p>As communities reopen, we hope to find solutions that lead to fewer headlines indicating small businesses are closing and focus more on the recovery on which we are about to embark. I look forward to the testimony of all our witnesses here today and to our continued partnership on this committee and I thank the chairwoman for again working with me and for our side of the aisle in making this I think the most bipartisan committee in Congress and that is why we are so effective in for example putting together the PPP program and trying to reform the EIDL loan program and so many other things. So I want to thank the Chairwoman for her continued cooperation and yield back. Thank you. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Ranking Member, and it is a pleasure, and it has been an example of how we need to do the job on behalf of the American people. </p><p>Now I would like to take a moment to explain how this hearing will proceed. Each witness will have five minutes to provide a statement, and each committee member will have five minutes for questions. Please ensure that your mic is on when you begin speaking and that you return to mute when finished.  </p><p>With that, I would like to thank our witnesses for taking time out of their busy schedules to join us. Our first witness is Mr. Brent Palmer, the President of the Small Investor Alliance. In this role, he works to foster a healthy environment for small businesses investing in a strong and profitable lower middle market. Mr. Palmer served in the executive branch from 2002 through 2005 as a presidential appointee in the Commerce Department as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Trade Legislation. He holds a history degree from Davidson College. </p><p>Our second witness is Ms. Amanda Cohen. Ms. Cohen is a James Beard-nominated chef and owner of Dirt Candy, the award-winning vegetarian restaurant in New York City's Lower East Side in my district. The restaurant was the first vegetable-focused restaurant in the city and is a pioneer of the vegetable-forward movement and is included on the list of the ten restaurants that changed America. She received two stars from the New York Times and was recognized by the Michelin Guide five years in a row. Welcome. </p><p>Our third witness is Dr. Lisa Cook. Dr. Cook is a Professor of Economics at the Michigan State University. Prior to joining the faculty at Michigan State, she was a Senior Economist at the President's Council for Economic Advisers from 2011 through 2012. She also held positions at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, the World Bank, the Brookings Institution, and the Hoover Institution. Welcome, Ms. Cook. And now, I would like to turn it over to the Ranking Member Mr. Chabot to introduce our last witness. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you very much again, Madam Chair, and our final witness is a fellow Cincinnatian, Pete Blackshaw. Mr. Blackshaw is CEO of Cintrifuse, a start-up incubator created by Procter &amp; Gamble or P&amp;G as a lot of people refer to it or Kroger and Western-Southern and other major entities in our greater Cincinnati community. He previously served as Global Head of Digital Marketing and Social Media at Nestle's global headquarters in Switzerland.  </p><p>He recently served as Chairman of the Board of the National Council of Better Business Bureaus and is now chairing a recently chartered supply chain and new commerce restart committee. Pete is a graduate of Harvard Business School and the University of California Santa Cruz. I recently had the pleasure of meeting with Pete via an online platform with the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, and he was truly impressed with--or I was truly impressed with his forward-thinking ideas on the recovery. I hope he was impressed too on--on the call, but I know he will provide valuable insight to the committee, and I look forward to hearing all of the witnesses here today, and I yield back. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Chabot, and thank you all for being here today. I would now like to begin by recognizing Mr. Palmer for five minutes. </p><p>PALMER: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Thank you for giving me--thank you to the committee for giving me the chance to share SBIA's view on how the small business investment companies can accelerate their recovery and create jobs for the long term. My name is Brett Palmer, and I am President of the Small Business Investor Alliance, the trade association representing small business investors, including SBICs. SBICs are SBA-regulated venture capital and private equity funds that provide long-term capital into American small businesses.  </p><p>For many, but not all our economy was doing well prior to the pandemic, and the ensuing government-mandated shutdowns. The economic disruption has exposed, amplified, and intensified pre-existing problems faced by the nation's small businesses. It has also created new ones. These amplifications affect vast numbers of small businesses, but the pain is not evenly spread by geography, industry sector, and stage of business or even race. It is also important to remember that the job losses and business injury we have experienced are only first-order effects of the pandemic, and there is more coming we just don't know what.  </p><p>We have faced hardships before, and we know what good public policy can do to help bring the economy back faster and stronger and to benefit more Americans. Now is the time to improve existing government programs to make sure they provide maximum benefit to as many Americans as possible. So policy adjustments should be made to address the immediate needs of small business in a way that takes into account past deficiencies and also meet future needs.  </p><p>Instead of normal stimulus spending where the benefit is temporary, Congress now has the chance to focus on the long-term and to empower and amplify the private sector that provides outsized job creation and sustainable benefits to communities by fully utilizing the SBIC program. Our economic problems are intense and will be long-lasting, but access to patient capital is the core to many of these solutions and challenges we face.  </p><p>So improving the SBIC program should address some of these problems that previously existed challenges to accessing patient--patient capital, which is particularly acute in low-income areas both rural and urban and even more acute for equity capital. The massive concentration of venture capital and growth capital and only a couple of areas of the country is leaving the rest of us behind; large disparities in accessing start-up and growth equity, underinvestment in domestic manufacturing, and domestic production; underrepresentation by women and minorities in both funds and in small businesses accessing capital and there are too few small funds which provide smaller investments that would fit in smaller communities and less dense communities.  </p><p>There are a host of new problems as well. Massive unemployment, failure of many small businesses, and some estimates are that 22 percent of small businesses are now out of business, but the catastrophic failure of minority-owned small businesses with some estimates of 32 percent of Hispanic-owned businesses and up to 41 percent of black-owned businesses lost. That is a national catastrophe.  </p><p>The American entrepreneurial spirit is strong, but to reemerge and recover, the small businesses will need to access patient capital, and patient capital is equity capital. It is long-term debt and equity-like debt, which is capital that can sustain the ups and downs and the fits and starts in any economy, even a pandemic. We also need to remove unintentional barriers to minorities and women forming SBIC funds. And more SBIC funds need to be formed that are smaller and serving more parts of the country because smaller funds really are able to handle smaller markets and serve smaller businesses.  </p><p>So the SBA's framework is a good one, but this experience is a very different experience than in the last recession and needs a tailored response to meet both the old needs that were unfulfilled and the new needs so modifying the existing program is faster, more affordable and more effective than a lot of other things we could be doing. So SBA proposes a couple of changes to the existing program, not creating new programs just modifying them.  </p><p>We would ask Congress to authorize an on-ramp to forming more--more first-time SBICs. A micro SBIC license would remove unintentional barriers to minorities and women entering the program while providing needed smaller dollar investments across the country. The SBIC program should also be modified to enable SBICs to provide more of the most patient, the most impactful and the most job-creating capital.  </p><p>Equity, when the Library of Congress looked at the SBIC program, they found that equity investments by small business investment companies commonly created over 400 or in sometimes over 500 new jobs per investment, and we need those jobs. There are also existing SBIC tools that provide patient equity-like capital, but they are currently limited by geography. These geographic restrictions should be lifted and made available to all small businesses. An SBA should encourage and enable SBICs to look for opportunities to make investments in underserved communities, both rural and urban, by making additional leverage available for investments in LMI areas and in underserved communities. </p><p>And finally, it would be very helpful if SBA's Office of Investment and Innovation be fully staffed and have the technology they need to be fully effective. They have been held back for that for years, and I think there is an opportunity for us to do more, and that would be a long-term investment and provide long-term benefits.  </p><p>I would also like to thank the committee for having an oversight hearing on the SBIC program last fall. It was probably an oversight committee the likes of which I know I have never seen before in 25 years, but it was very helpful, and under Administrator Carranza's leadership it has been transformative and positive, and she has brought increased accountability to the program, and it has really turned around and doing great so thank you for your oversight. Thank you for this hearing, and I look forward to answering any questions. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Palmer, and now I would like to recognize Ms. Cohen, and please let me remind members you need to keep your cameras on. Thank you. Welcome, Ms. Cohen, for five minutes. </p><p>COHEN: Chairman Velasquez, Ranking Member Chabot, and distinguished members of this committee thank you so much for to testify today about my experience with the Paycheck Protection Program, the experience of other independent restaurants and what this industry needs to survive the rest of the year and beyond. My name is Amanda Cohen, and I am the chef and owner of Dirt Candy on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Chairwoman Velasquez has been a longtime advocate for business owners like me, and I'm honored to appear today as a voice for so many voiceless businesses. </p><p>Dirt Candy is a fine dining vegetarian restaurant in New York with about 40 seats and a bar. We started back in 2008 with just 18 seats but quickly outgrew our first location, and in 2015 we moved to this new one on the Lower East Side. I am also honored to represent the leadership team of the Independent Restaurant Coalition, a newly formed coalition of thousands of chefs and restauranteurs across the country in every congressional district organized for the first time in response to the pandemic. We represent America's nearly 500,000 restaurants, nearly three-quarters of all dining establishments in the country who don't have the same access to significant debt instruments or private equity as corporate-owned businesses. </p><p>Today I'm going to share the story independent restaurants how we use the PPP and what we need to do to survive, which is really your help. Dirt Candy reopened a week ago today for outside seating the first time since New York's shut down orders. Outdoor dining has forced us to dramatically alter our menu and processes for serving customers. A number of our dishes are really not conducive to heat, the rain, wind, and our seating is on a ramp to the Williamsburg Bridge, which really isn't the most romantic location.  </p><p>I wasn't able to pay my employees during the shutdown, so many went on to unemployment or took other jobs. While I received a Paycheck Protection Program loan I chose not to use the money at the start because it was unclear when we could reopen again and if my fixed cost of running a business don't change and demand for dining out remains low there is absolutely no way Dirt Candy can survive because there's a larger issue. Going out to a restaurant is not considered to be safe.  </p><p>When the pandemic hit, I laid off all 35 employees at Dirt Candy. About six weeks ago, I rehired one person to help get the restaurant ready to open in its current form. As of today, I have only rehired 17 percent or six of my employees, and I don't plan on rehiring others for the foreseeable future. This was only possible because of the PPP. In fact, the changes to the effective date of the PPP that this can be worked on and which went into effect in June are the only reason I could afford to reopen Dirt Candy at all but even if my doors are open there still 29 more people who used to count on Dirt Candy for their well-being who are out of work. </p><p>Some independent restaurants cannot access the PPP because their bank took care of other customers first or rejected their applications. Others were afraid to use the loans they received and returned them because they cannot afford to make a mistake and take on more debt. Those who received and used the PPP loans are seeing them run out or not bridge the time needed to fund operations in this uniquely affected industry.  </p><p>The one thing that would be enormously impactful for the restaurant industry is passing Congressman Earl Blumenauer's Restaurant Act. The Chairwoman has cosponsored this bill for which I am exceptionally grateful as have eight more members of this committee. Independent restaurants generate $271 billion in direct and indirect economic activity. Passing this bill would reduce the unemployment rate by 2.4 percent. As many as 85 percent independent restaurants say they will close without direct help. Passing this bill would help avoid this disaster. Restaurants need your help.  </p><p>As you can see from my testimony above, the PPP with the significant changes Congress made in late spring is an eight-week solution to an 18-month problem for restaurants. My PPP loan allowed me to reopen, but it is not going to allow me to stay open even if it is forgiven, and Dirt Candy does not stand alone in this. Our restaurant supports farmers, vintners, vineyards, brewers, liquor purveyors, and an entire supply chain. Most other restaurants can add fishers, ranchers, and other parts of the supply chain to this list. Imagine planning a trip to New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Charleston, Atlanta, or Washington D.C. without being able to visit the great restaurants that they are known for.  </p><p>Independent restaurants draw millions of tourists from all around the world. In 2019 total spending five domestic and international travelers on food services in the United States was $279 billion. That is more than double the amount spent on either recreation or retail.  </p><p>Thank you again for the opportunity to be here and to share the story of independent restaurants with you. I sincerely hope that you will find a way to help independent restaurants with all of the hard work that you are doing on behalf of small businesses across the country. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Ms. Cohen and now I would like to recognize Dr. Cook for five minutes. </p><p>COOK: Chairwoman Velasquez and Ranking Member Chabot, thank you for the opportunity to address the committee on small business on the topic of long-lasting solutions for a small business recovery. The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting human, economic, and financial crises are unfolding at breakneck speed, and as a result, small firms are in crisis.  </p><p>The quick action of Congress has gone some way to lessen or postpone the pain associated with this pandemic induced recession. Specifically, assistance to small businesses to keep paying employees through the $670 billion paycheck protecting--protection program PPP the largest ever investment in small businesses was a critical lifeline for many small businesses.  </p><p>Prior to the pandemic, most small firms reported being in good shape, and 73 percent reported that their financial health was good or stable. None the less the financial health of small firms vary greatly depending on the race or ethnicity of the owner. Compared to 27 percent of small white firms reporting that they were at risk or in distress, 49 percent of small Hispanic firms and 57 percent of small black firms reported being at risk or distressed. Black and small--black and Hispanic firms were less prepared to weather an adverse shock like this pandemic.  </p><p>According to the Federal Reserve, distressed firms are three times more likely to close relative to healthy firms due to a two-month revenue shock. Further, the concentration of small minority-owned firms in certain sectors makes them more vulnerable in the wake of COVID-19. These sectors in which many small minority-owned firms are overrepresented are a combination in food services, personal or laundry services, and retail. By early May, it is estimated that 100,000 small businesses or 2 percent of small businesses had already closed. By mid-June of the businesses that are listed on Yelp 140,000 of those closing since March 1 were still closed by mid-June. 35 percent of shopping and retail businesses listed have closed their doors temporarily, 53 percent of restaurants listed have closed their doors permanently.  </p><p>The burden of small business closures is also unevenly distributed. 41 percent of African-American businesses reported being closed compared to 35 percent overall, and the only survey providing different graphic data on PPP loan recipients the color of change reports that 45 percent of--45 percent of black and Latino businesses will close by the end of the year without more relief. Minority-owned businesses also report not being able to access PPP loans due to the heavy reliance on large banks with whom they have had historically poor relationships. Over one-third of small businesses reported paying reduced rent or deferred rent payments.  </p><p>In FiveThirtyEight's most recent survey, a majority of macroeconomists believe that there will be a partial rebound in economic activity and a slow recovery rather than a V-shaped, sharp recovery. With a slower than anticipated recovery and with the experience of PPP, I would urge this committee to consider what it might do in the short and long run to address the small business crisis.  </p><p>Now I would support policy action that would modify PPP to work alongside the enhanced unemployment insurance benefits under the CARES Act. The Rebuilding Main Street Act from Senators Van Hollen, Merkley, and Murphy proposes such a modification. This would provide grants to especially hard-hit small firms to cover fixed cost and expenses if the employers use short-term compensation arrangements or a system such that the employers avoid layoffs and instead reduce hours worked by each employee at the firm. Employees would then continue to receive unemployment insurance on a prorated basis to compensate for reduced wages. </p><p>No matter what the modification, demographic data should be collected at the loan or grant application phase and any future modified PPP effort, not just on the back end of the program. These data were supposed to be tracked such that the most vulnerable firms would be prioritized. Not only should these data be collected, any current and additional relief should be targeted at these firms. Policymakers should consider in the long-run distribution channels for aid in the future that can provide aid to small firms directly, whether than via banks or other lenders.  </p><p>Most importantly, the human and technological capacity of the SBA to process and implement swiftly and efficiently, such a program as PPP, should be increased significantly. Given the long-standing importance of small businesses as an entry point to the middle class and their contribution to the economy overall, this capacity-building should have happened long ago, and this won't be the last natural disaster or economic and financial crisis, and SBA will need to be better equipped to meet these challenges. Thank you. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Dr. Cook, and now let's recognize Mr. Blackshaw for five minutes. Welcome, thank you. </p><p>BLACKSHAW: Thank you. Chair Velazquez, Minority Ranking Member Chabot, members, thanks for the opportunity. I just have one core message, and that is that the best way to help small business owners thrive in this very uncertain world is to help them think and act like start-ups, and when I say start-ups, I don't mean Silicon Valley or Ivy League entrepreneurs. I am referring to the next generation taking on big unsolved challenges in every sector of our society and turning them on their heads, and many of the start-up founders are women and minorities, a growing percentage I say with pride are coming from the Midwest and we are living in an age of unending you know disruption which economic, social, health-related shocks are going to become more common.  </p><p>Some call this VUCA, volatile uncertain complex and ambiguous and a VUCA world requires VUCA leadership, precisely what a start-up mindset enables and to be clear there are urgent needs as we have heard you know today that small business owners need help right now, paycheck protection, access to capital, streamlined regulation and policies all critical and necessary. But we also need to look beyond the present to a future that is going to be even more demanding than the moment that we are living in today and to do so with urgency.  </p><p>Now many of us talk about reskilling or even upskilling; neither in my view is enough. We need start-up skilling and a start-up mindset prizes speed, rapid prototyping, constant iteration, failing fast to learn fast. It is obsessed with data, what to see in it, and how to exploit it. It is very, very digital. I think start-up skilling should be a national priority you know led perhaps by the SBA and involving corporations, universities, and start-up ecosystems. </p><p>Now, what does start-up skilling look like? First, it is showing small business owners how they can apply start-up thinking, technologies, and practices to their own venture. So, for example, at Cintrifuse, we hosted a program called Nitro in partnership with J.P. Morgan Chase. Over one weekend, we start-up skilled several dozen minority-led businesses. We gave them access to mentors. We showed them how to leverage technologies. We brought in Google. We taught them the principle start-up leadership, and I think this is something that we should be doing constantly every weekend, in fact.  </p><p>We are also seeing a promising movement in what is known as micro-credentialing aimed at urban and rural areas, so Miami University of Ohio, for example, is one such school that is kind of taking their faculty outside of the ivory tower, bringing them into the community with different types of credentialing focused on new business skills you know basic skills in finance, marketing, and accounting. I think we need a lot more of that. We need to encourage the universities to do that. </p><p>Second, I think it's about learning from the digital natives, the kids who have grown up digital. As we speak, Cintrifuse is sponsoring a virtual summer entrepreneurial academy. It is way oversubscribed, and these students, high schoolers, and college they are developing start-up ideas to help address pressing challenges related to COVID-19, sustainability, social justice, and we are challenging them to explore ways in which radically more supply chains might be part of a better future. </p><p>Thirdly, I want you to think about you know mobilizing and re-platforming small business services. Don't--don't shoot the messenger but I spent hours before this testimony reviewing government and SBA digital apps and websites and you name it, and you know I think the SBA in particular needs a digital start-up infusion and I would encourage you to think about why can't--why can't government create an open innovation platform you know to crowdsource easier, less bureaucratic online solutions for small businesses. It's not just about money it's about time and simplicity, but why not take greater advantage of audience-rich big tech Google, Microsoft, Amazon?  </p><p>I mean Facebook, for example, has more than 3 billion users including tens of millions of small business users and I know they are taking lots of heat for issues I'm not going to get into here but why not invite them to co-develop the next-generation hub for small business services and start-up skilling not a page or an ad campaign but SBA on steroids? That would be a game-changer overnight. </p><p>My final observation is that I think there is little distinction between a tech start-up and a mom and pop small business. They are both based on an idea, a problem that needs to be solved, an entrepreneurial spirit and the desire to take a shot and carve out your own path and whether we are talking about scalable technology or small-town service we are talking about the same thing. Business is built on the ingenuity, passion, and persistence of people who simply want to make the company better--the country better by finding a better way that is American entrepreneurialism, and I would say the bumper sticker is let's start-up skill America. Thank you. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you, Mr. Blackshaw, and now I recognize myself for five minutes. </p><p>Dr. Cook, Congress responded to the great recession by making a couple of changes to SBA loan programs, including increasing the guarantee on 7(a) loans and reducing fees in both the 7(a) and 504. As Congress weighs long-term recovery proposals for small businesses, would you recommend similar changes to SBA lending programs right now going forward? </p><p>COOK: I--I would because this has to be encouraged, take-up has to be encouraged. I would also echo what Mr. Blackshaw would say that the--the digital transformation of SBA is something that I was promoting when I was at the White House in 2011 and 2012. I think this is absolute--given the speed of this crisis, I think this has got to be matched with the speed of digital infrastructure and human capacity building at SBA, yes. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: And this is one of the things that we need to keep in mind, especially the administration when they submit the budget because it takes resources in order for them to implement those changes. Ms. Cohen, as the virus continues to spread in our country we have seen states who had once reopened restaurants and bars now shut them down again. How have the multiple closures impacted the hospitality industry? </p><p>COHEN: Madam Chairwoman multiple closures are devastating for restaurants. We lose staff; we lose food, we lose our customers' goodwill. We lose our--our hope. A second round of full closures will finish off a number of independent restaurants permanently. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. Thank you, and there have been calls for proposals targeted to certain sectors that may face a long road to recovery over or who may face the reoccurring shutdowns like the hospitality industry. Why do SBA's current economic relief programs not address the hospitality industry needs, and why is targeted relief necessary? </p><p>COHEN: The hospitality industry has unique issues. We--we depend on gathering a lot of people in a small place to generate revenue. So long as people are not in my restaurant, I will not be able to pay suppliers, continue to employ my staff, or generate revenue. I cannot take on any more debt with any of these other programs. I need something that specifically work--or we need something that specifically works for the restaurant industry and allows us to get back up on our feet without any debt. Some of the programs have worked-- </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. Thank you. Just we have a short period of time to ask all of the questions that we need to ask. Mr. Palmer, the Congressional efforts that we have seen so far to provide relief for small business have focused on bank financing specifically the PPP program so as our local economies begin to slowly reopen and recover can you walk us through what some small businesses will need in terms of long-term capital and the role that the Small Business Administration or SBI--SBIC program can play off of providing that capital? </p><p>PALMER: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I think Amanda, the other witness nailed it pretty well. A lot of businesses are up to their eyeballs in debt, and they are really--they are really going to be looking for patient capital, they are going to need something that isn't going to cause the banks that are already in forbearance and calling on their loans to provide capital. They are going to need other equity, or they are going to need equity-like capital, and there are some tools that are existing in the SBIC platform particularly the LMI debenture that are very patient where you can draw a loan, but there's no payments for five years, and then you pay after that, and that is operation zero subsidy.  </p><p>That's a proven tool right now, but it is limited in geography so a lot of--a lot of places can't use it. Opening up some tools like that, I think, would be very helpful in the recovery of businesses, and as you add more SBICs being able to offer those, I think it would be even more beneficial. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. My time has expired, and now I would recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Chabot. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, Madam Chair, and I will begin with Mr. Palmer. Mr. Palmer, you have testified before our committee many times. We appreciate you being here again today. How important is it that we evaluate our current government programs to reduce duplication in order to ensure that our programs are the most effective that they can be? </p><p>PALMER: I think it is critical and I think right now Congress has the time to really focus and when the CARES Act was created you know the PPP was a lifesaver, and it's a brilliant program and thank you for doing it, but certainly there were some problems with it because it was written at the front-end of an economic tornado hit it. Now you have the time to really look at it and make sure that things are effective, not duplicative, and that they are really adjusting to the different industry sectors and geographies that need different types of capital so I think it is necessary. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, and I'll go to Mr. Blackshaw next, how--how can the Nitro program that you mentioned serve as an example for future efforts and was there anything that you felt could have been improved or any recommendations that you would make to us? </p><p>BLACKSHAW: Thank you for the question. My first is regret is that we treated it as episodically that one weekend that you built up, but you know looking back, I mean, we can do that nonstop, and I want everyone here to think about and just think about this hearing right now. It is our ability to kind of scale services and scale intimacy in the form of like any type of training has gone up exponentially, and so it is really easy to parachute in an expert who can help a small business owner to pick up a critical skill, and there are very critical foundational price of entry digital capabilities that even you know the ice cream shop needs to understand to be competitive in the marketplace today. </p><p>So I think the opportunities like how do we scale it? I think there's a big opportunity to get more companies just to subsidize the effort, this isn't about just about getting you know the government to kind of pay for it. I think there's a win-win for everyone, but we got to bring that start-up mindset of more for less you know--you know digital kind of agility and then definitely leverage this power of virtual not to take away from the off-line there still a power there, but we can serve a lot of critical needs really, really fast. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you very much and I think I will go to Ms. Cohen next. Ms. Cohen, in your testimony you discussed how people still feel unsafe going to restaurants; the same can be said for the tourism industry as well. What can we do to help people feel a sense of safety and security again so that your restaurant and others will be moving in the right direction? </p><p>COHEN: Unfortunately, I'm not sure we can get anybody to feel safe until we have a vaccine. I mean, that is the reality. In the meantime, not forcing restaurants to have to open up more tables than they feel comfortable with or hotels or anybody. We cannot congregate too many people in one place. We have to make people feel safe. It is my job as a restauranteur to make my customers feel safe and to know that I have made my employees feel safe so everybody can come and dine and feel relaxed, which is what they should do in a restaurant. I can't do that if I'm looking at my bottom line instead of my payroll. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you. Dr. Cook, you had said that you felt that we were likely to experience you know a slow recovery. If you had to pick just one thing to change that what would it be? </p><p>COOK: I would echo the sentiments of Amanda Cohen that there has to be attention paid to COVID-19 first. That is absolutely it. There is like nothing else if I have to choose one thing it would be that we would provide say relief to businesses, to the American people that had to do with addressing the healthcare crisis. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you, and I think I've got time to squeeze one more question in so Mr. Blackshaw I will go back to you again. We are obviously both in the Midwest here, and you mentioned the Midwest. What specifically is encouraging start-ups in our part of the country in the Midwest at least prior to the COVID-19 crisis, and how can we continue to fuel that start-up culture that we have been seeing? </p><p>BLACKSHAW: I think it is critical to lower barriers of entry for entrepreneurs, and you know cost structure contributes to that. I am a native Californian, so I don't want to you know disparage my--my former state, but you know there's a cost-benefit picture that can get in the way of you know being able to kind of jump in early, test and learn and I do think I located my first start-up in Cincinnati, the burn rate you know it extended much longer. </p><p>I think there is a quality of life that typically gets overlooked and there's a wonderful, a wonderful synergy especially in greater Cincinnati but also Northern Kentucky with the large companies that are very, very open in a very humble way from a let's work with start-ups because they can solve big challenges that we can't figure out, maybe we are too bureaucratic, and we need--and there's a healthy internal focus that I am seeing more in the Midwest than I have seen in other locations and so I think those are just a few of the factors that really play out. I think wherever you are building a supportive ecosystem is critical, and that is public, that is private universities; those formulas can work. </p><p>CHABOT: Thank you. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired, and now we recognize the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Mfume for five minutes. </p><p>MFUME: Let me just unmute, and thank you very much. Madam Chair I want to thank you. I want to thank the ranking member obviously for convening this particular hearing. I think it is an extremely forward-looking topic that has to be dealt with after I agree we have been able to deal with the major topic, which is this pandemic.  </p><p>Madam Chair, I apologize for just getting on recently. As you know, the Democratic caucus is underway, and I am on the hearing of the Oversight Committee, so I jumped on to be on. It has been an interesting discussion. I would reserve any time or the right to ask questions at this moment so that I am not deliberately or un-deliberately redundant in what I would like to talk about, and I would yield back and welcome the discussion that continues. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman yields back, and now we recognize the gentleman from Oklahoma Mr. Hern for five minutes. Is Mr. Hern on? Mr. Stauber, the gentleman from Minnesota, is recognized for five minutes. You need to unmute. I think that he is having technical difficulties. </p><p>STAUBER: Madam Chair, can I get back in in a minute? </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Sure. Mr. Stauber, Mr. Burchett, Mr. Burchett, is recognized for five minutes. </p><p>BURCHETT: Can you all hear me? </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Yes. </p><p>BURCHETT: Thank you. I appreciate the testimony and appreciate Chairlady and Ranking Member. I was--Mrs. or let's see, Dr. Cook answered this question for me, but I would like to know from Mr. Palmer your testimony mentioned that up to 22 percent of businesses that failed due to COVID-19, but that number rises to an estimated 41 percent of black-owned small businesses. That is a huge disparity, and that--that troubles me greatly. I've--my whole life I have worked in and around our community and business community and lots of black folks, and I am concerned about that. How do you think we can address or rectify the problem? </p><p>PALMER: It--it is a real problem and once we sort of get the economy stabilized with health which is the foundational issue and I will just set that aside I think we really need to look at you know really equity capital. There was an excellent article by Eddie Brown in the Washington Post this last week, the founder of Brown Capital, and he called equity capital the rocket ship for job creation and highlighted how little of it is in the hands black entrepreneurs.  </p><p>I think we need to inform that have more SBIC funds that have more black fund managers, more women fund managers and that is part of that SBIC, the micro SBIC model where we can form you know funds by broadening out the funnel of who can come in and then we should harness the private investment that comes in and amplify it in a way that really creates jobs and ownership of businesses.  </p><p>But we have to be deliberate about the real barriers because most black entrepreneurs just have less capital. The amount of start-up capital that a black entrepreneur has versus a white entrepreneur is about 1/36, and that is a barrier, and so they need external capital. We need more small, private, and venture funds and more small private capital funds around the country and not just concentrated in the three areas where they spend most of it now. So I think giving more of those that have a regional or a local would be a very beneficial help. </p><p>BURCHETT: What I have found a lot of the times here in Tennessee that funds are available, but nobody knows how to get to them, and you know you've got the good old boy network, but also it's just about a method of educating folks, and we do that through the urban league or chambers of commerce or what have you. I just see a huge duplication and I don't see anything getting done. I just see the people in these organizations driving nice cars and having nice offices, and I am not seeing anything done. </p><p>PALMER: There's been some studies done that a lot of black entrepreneurs don't get loans and part of it because they don't ask for them because they think they're going to be turned down. They don't have that connection in the community or in that region, and I think that the financial providers both SBIC funds and banks and others need to do a far better job of doing outreach and letting folks know how to access the capital because it--is is there in many cases. </p><p>BURCHETT: What do you think of nonprofits in the private sector can do to increase access to capital and promote (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>PALMER: I think the private sector is the driver for it. Nonprofits there lots of different nonprofits they can be facilitators and educators and provide roles and Mr. Blackshaw as a witness as an example of that as far as training goes those entrepreneurs about how to access the capital, how to ask for the right kinds of capital, the right amounts, how to be prepared for it to increase your likelihood of success. But ultimately, we need tax policy and regulatory policy that really encourages them augments and doesn't create barriers to accessing that capital. So we--we need both working together in a deliberate fashion. </p><p>BURCHETT: Ms. Cohen, I--I dig your enthusiasm. Never been to New York before you can probably tell from my accent I'm not--I'm not even from the north part of Tennessee, but I was wondering about a ripple effect that will occur in our communities with the restaurant industry operating below full employment and what can we do to limit these effects and make our economy recover faster, ma'am? </p><p>COHEN: Well, first off, you are invited to my restaurant anytime that you are in New York. </p><p>BURCHETT: And did you say is it a vegetarian restaurant? </p><p>COHEN: It's--it's a vegetarian restaurant. It's a vegetable restaurant, but it's delicious. </p><p>BURCHETT: Okay if you say so. </p><p>COHEN: So the best thing you can do is actually support our Restaurant Act, that will put more real money back into my restaurant, and then I can put it back out into the economy, and I can start supporting my suppliers again that is really what I need to do. I need to help get them back up on their feet, and the only way I can do that is if I have some money to spend on them. </p><p>BURCHETT: Okay. How much time do I have left Chairlady? Have I run over? </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Almost, two seconds. </p><p>BURCHETT: Do what? </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Two seconds. </p><p>BURCHETT: Okay. Well, I will yield back the remainder of my time then. Thank you so much, and I am glad that my wife is not here to see you because if she saw that wonderful outfit that you're wearing, I know on the way home I'd have to be looking for that for her. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. </p><p>BURCHETT: Of course. Well, thank you so much, ma'am, and you are always hospitable to me. Thank you, ma'am. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman's time has expired, and now the gentlelady from California, Ms. Chu, is recognized. </p><p>CHU: Yes. Mr. Palmer, I am so glad you are here to express how important SBIC is and how much more potential it has to address our COVID-19 economic crisis. Since its inception, SBICS have created or sustained nearly 10 million jobs, and yet this program operates at extremely low risk to the taxpayer. Even though there is an SBA guarantee the private investors' capital completely exhausted before that guarantee is even impacted and as a result this program operates at zero subsidy. </p><p>So because of this success, I introduced HR 116, the Investing In Main Street Act to allow banks to invest more of their capital in SBICs and the legislation passed the House early this Congress but still awaits further action in the Senate. So can you explain what made the SBIC program so successful during the last economic recovery and how the Investing In Main Street Act can make SBICs more effective as our economy recovers from the COVID pandemic? </p><p>PALMER: Well, thank you very much for that question and for your support of SBICs and making that correction that would allow more banks to put capital into SBICs, and I will mention that there are a couple of reasons why the program works. First, it works because it passes all of the private sector requirements, and second, it works because it fills a public policy purpose.  </p><p>The program really puts the taxpayer in second loss position and the private capital in first loss position as it always should be, and I think that makes it work. I--I really think right now one of the things that is coming out--we have the pandemic, but we also have massive social unrest and an awakening to some problems that existed before, and we need more smaller SBIC funds, and I think we need more smaller funds serving minority communities, and you have the banks that are very interested in doing that now, and so we want to take away any barriers that would be in place that might limit the ability for capital providers to get capital where it is clearly needed and re-create those jobs that have been lost and re-start up those businesses that may be mothballed at the moment and re-empower those entrepreneurs, so that is what we do. We would like to do more of it and your legislation is a critical part of it, so thank you very much for your support of it. </p><p>CHU: Thank you so much. Dr. Cook, people of color, have suffered disproportionate health and economic impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic. As you mentioned, business owners of color are at higher risk of permanent closure, which makes SBA's failure to collect adequate demographic data on participants in recovery programs like the paycheck protection program especially harmful. For example, SBA failed to collect any racial Democratic data for 94 percent of the nearly 500,000 PPP loans under $150,000 that were made in California. That means they only collected on 6 percent of the businesses that actually got those loans; given California's diverse population that is unacceptable. </p><p>One thing I know, these businesses need help, so I plan to introduce legislation to authorize SBA's community advantage loan program, which provides access to affordable government-backed capital to underserved markets, and under this legislation businesses owned by minorities, women, and veterans and also provides them technical assistance. Can you talk about the role the programs--that programs designed to reach underserved small businesses should play in our long-term recovery? </p><p>COOK: Well, one of the key features of entrepreneurship in America is that it has been a path to the middle class and it's been a path to wealth. And certainly for minority businesses, given the losses they suffered--minorities suffered, especially Blacks and Hispanics suffered during the Great Recession, this would go some way to close the racial wealth gap. So I think entrepreneurship is just so critical to the American experience to both income and wealth. The kind of attention that would be given to it, I think would be well worth it.  </p><p>CHU: And why is the demographic information so important? </p><p>COOK: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last part. Why is the demographic-- </p><p>CHU: --information so important this time?  </p><p>COOK: Oh, it's because, as I mentioned in my delivered remarks, the Black and Hispanic businesses, especially, we're already vulnerable. So if you want to really make sure that you--you're making sure that the recovery is even, they should be targeted. And this was, I mean, you all articulated that they should be prioritized and for good reason. So, I think this any extension, any additional relief, going to small businesses should make sure to target these businesses and collected the data--the demographic data. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentlelady's time has expired. And now I recognize the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Stauber.  </p><p>STAUBER: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Chabot.  </p><p>Mr. Blackshaw, how do you think we most effectively bring that, quote, \"startup skill\" you've mentioned in your testimony to rural America? </p><p>BLACKSHAW: Yeah, thank you for the question.  </p><p>I mean, clearly when we mean the first thing, I think we need to continue to take a close look at internet broadband access in rural districts and I think anything we can do to kind of equalize access, I think is really important. I think in the state of Ohio there's a big concerted effort on that. And I think that's good for any type of kind of startup layer. There's no question that digitalization pervades everything. And so I think getting that piece work is--you know, is absolutely critical.  </p><p>I think one of the great things about what we're all experimenting with right now is I think if that digital infrastructure is in place there's infinite access to--you know, training experts parachuted in, virtual mentoring, you name it, and I--you know, I just challenge us to think about like how we can use that new environment. You know, what we're doing right now on steroids needs a completely different model of access, even in rural--in rural communities where I think--you know, what the one opportunity in certain rural areas is you got to get the invent everything from scratch, you're not burdened by a lot of legacy practices in terms of how technology is used, you basically--you know, put in a whole new fat broadband pipe and you're kind of inventing almost as a startup with--with a clean sheet of paper.  </p><p>So I'm very bullish about the opportunity there. But there's clearly--you know, some investment on technology required. And obviously, probably some funding as well.  </p><p>STAUBER: Yeah--you know, one of the biggest issues that--that has been exposed during this pandemic is limited access to broadband in rural America. It has been talked about for many years, but many are seeing just how bad it is for the very first time. So when we come to these hearings and hear the many wonderful ideas of how we can help businesses pivot their models and help them mobilize and re-platform, it feels that the businesses in rural America are not considered.  </p><p>And I think it's--it's high time that we actually take that step forward and start investing. We need to take steps to bring parity to these rural businesses so they can be more resilient in--and as you mentioned, Mr. Blackshaw, a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world. It's critically important. And I would just say--you know, from--from your words Mr. Blackshaw, let's definitely work together to bring that start--quote, \"startup skill\" to rural America.  </p><p>We are seeing the digital divide--the negative effects of the digital divide. We have schoolchildren in rural America that have to--their parents have to drive them to a bus that is a hotspot so they can download their homework and get their homework. That is unacceptable. And we also know that rural America, these--this broadband is going to help keep our rural schoolchildren competitive, our rural hospitals open, and it's going to bring the rural economy--people are going to move to rural America at--for our quality of life.  </p><p>And I think we have to--it is--it is time now to invest in rural America and the broadband to bring that--those startup skills to everyone, including not only rural Minnesota but the rural America. And would you agree with that?  </p><p>BLACKSHAW: Not only that I'm signed up to help in any way, I think it's critically important. It's overdue and the opportunity and the upside, the payout will be massive if we make that effort.  </p><p>STAUBER: Yep. That's an investment that needs to happen. And Madam Chair, I yield back. Thank you. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman yields back. And now we recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Evans. You need to unmute, Mr. Evans. </p><p>EVANS: That's fine. Thank you, Madam Chair. </p><p>Ms. Cohen, many of my constituents in Philadelphia are restaurant owners, like yourself and are barely surviving. Coming from a city where nearly half of the population is minorities, I'm interested in solutions that can help many groups as possible. That is why I support the Restaurant Act. Minorities make up over 40 percent of the overall restaurant work. Restaurants employ more minority managers than any other industry. One to three restaurant owners come from a minority background.  </p><p>Ms. Cohen, can you tell me why do you think the Restaurant Act would be more beneficial to restaurants than the EIDL or the PPP program? </p><p>COHEN: I think--I think that it's more beneficial to us and thank you for the question. Because both those programs put us into debt and restaurants operate willingly on a very slim margin. We put a ton of money back into the economy. And I think it's unfair at this moment to ask us to take on more debt. So the Restaurant Act allows us to receive money without debt and put it back into the economy. And that's why it is the best program for restaurants at this moment. </p><p>EVANS: Mr. Palmer and Dr. Cook, the Benjamin Franklin Technology Partners, which is an initiative of the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce and Economic Development, suggested an idea to my office on how to increase SBIC investments. The SPC investments have a low, fixed interest rate while private investors often negotiate a much higher interest rate for its portion of the investment. However, private investors must wait until the SBA has been fully repaid on this portion of the investment before they can start to receive investments. This means that private investors often wait years for seeing any return.  </p><p>Can you give me your reaction to that idea? Mr. Palmer or Dr. Cook?  </p><p>PALMER: Sure, I--I don't know the full details. But I think that I'm actually working with Benjamin Franklin partners to fill--to use the SBIC program more broadly make it more accessible to small venture funds like theirs across the country. The--the private investors that drive these things do demand a certain rate of return. And we need to make sure that whatever products we're offering actually passes the market filter there to drive that private capital to them to--to--to make sure that the capital is there because if it's not, they just--they just won't do it.  </p><p>But I--I don't know the specific structure, but I'd be happy to work with you and your staff on it. Because I think Benjamin Franklin Funds serve Pennsylvania well. I--I think they're a model for lots of other states and we'd love to make the SBIC program more flexible to serve more funds like that and more places in Pennsylvania. </p><p>EVANS: Dr. Cook, any reaction. </p><p>COOK: I would say that anything that pushes private investors to invest in for African American entrepreneurs, in particular, is--is well worth it. Only 1 percent of African American founders receive venture capital funding. So anything that will increase that kind of private capital, I think would be well worth it. </p><p>EVANS: Okay, Mr. Palmer, Dr. Cook real quick. Three states, California, Massachusetts, and New York saw over 70 percent of all venture capital investment from 2014 to 2018. In that same period, my home state of Pennsylvania received less than five percent of the total venture capital. What suggestions would you have that we could do in Pennsylvania to make it more appealing? </p><p>PALMER: I would--I would suggest that not just for Pennsylvania but just the diversification and democratization of venture capital is reimagine an equity platform for the SBICs. When the SBICs are able to do more early stage investing, they were all over the country in much smaller cities and outside those three concentrated areas. We can do that in a way that is protective of the taxpayer and that would--that would--that would fix a lot of that problem. I think that's one of the things that the SBA can do. And then you have authority on this committee over it. </p><p>EVANS: Dr. Cook, real quick, you have any thoughts on that? </p><p>COOK: I would say that one of the things that would attract capital to areas like yours, like mine in Michigan, like Blackshaw's in--in Ohio, would be to invest in digital infrastructure. I--I hate to keep going back to this, I work on the economics of innovation. But the digital divide between rural and urban, for example, or from post and other places in the country, it's critical that this be built out. We're not going to be competitive in any kind of competitive economy if we don't do this. So I think this is a deep investment that has to be made and be made quickly. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman's time has expired. Now we recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Bishop, for five minutes. </p><p>BISHOP: Thank you, Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Chabot. Thank you for the hearing. Thank you to the witnesses for lending their expertise.  </p><p>I appreciate the interesting discussion about some new and long term solutions, some of them potentially expensive but I hope to address briefly one beneficial policy change we can make right away to an existing program so more small businesses remain standing once this crisis is over.  </p><p>Two weeks ago, our committee heard from SBA Associate Administrator James Rivera on the implementation of the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program in the course of the pandemic. To be frank, I believe SBA's rationale for limiting the size of idle loans to $150,000 to have left a great deal to be desired. This decision not only sorely disappointed the expectations of businesses hoping to receive relief, it was incomprehensibly bad credit decision. After all, if a business's intrinsic financial circumstances warrant the $2 million loan to extend it a $150,000 loan is a futile act, which guarantees not only failure of the business but of course a default on the inadequate loan as well. And that in turn negatively impacts U.S. taxpayers.  </p><p>Unfortunately, it is up to Congress to fix SBA's error. When reflecting upon our hearing and talking to constituents one idea suggested was to allow idle borrowers to go back for a second idle or modify the EIDL loan balance to receive higher amount. The idea would be business received an idle for less than the appropriate amount it could receive a supplemental loan for the difference between the appropriate amount according to SBA underwriting standards and the amount previously loaned under SBA's misguided $150,000 limitation.  </p><p>For example, if company X would have qualified for an EIDL for a million dollars to help it weather this crisis but only received $150,000, Congress would allow that business to reapply for a second IEDL worth up to $850,000. To restore constituents' faith in our relief efforts and those of SBA it is important, I submit, that we provide them the relief that was promised to them on the front end.  </p><p>To the--to the panel, Mr. Palmer, we've had good conversations. You've always supported and been open about common-sense solutions. Do you think this idea of allowing businesses effectively to double-dip on EIDL would help more businesses to weather the short term storm? </p><p>PALMER: I'm not sure I'd call it double-dipping, because the statutory language was I think was a $2 million cap. I mean, I think there's an obligation for agencies to follow the explicit language of the law written by the legislative branch.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: That's correct.  </p><p>PALMER: Now, one thing I think it's just the right thing to do legally, we're a nation of laws. But two there's clear expectations from small businesses if small businesses were dedicating their limited time and resources to accessing the amount that the law specifically allowed and didn't know they could access--but they really couldn't access it. That's not really fair to them. And this disaster has gone on longer than expected. So I think allowing people to go back to get the caps that they need, knowing the damages that they have, seems perfectly reasonable to me. </p><p>BISHOP: Thank you, Mr. Palmer.  I agree. I think my choice of term is probably a poor one. It really is simply going back and allowing them to have what was--what was intended in the first instance.  </p><p>Dr. Cook, would you agree with Mr. Palmer's assessment of that idea? </p><p>COOK: Yes--yes, I would. </p><p>BISHOP: Ms. Cohen, I heard what you said about the--the restaurant legislation that would provide grants and I'm sure that would be your preference. But do you know of any additional restaurants that could take advantage of the ability to go--go back and get the full EDL amount or something closer to it depending on its own--own circumstances that that would be a welcome opportunity for some? </p><p>COHEN: I can't speak for all restaurants but I certainly no--no that--no that no restaurant I know is at the moment could have possibly fathomed the idea of taking on more debt while they're still trying to climb out of the situation that we're in, unfortunately. </p><p>BISHOP: Do you think if they had a choice between additional indebtedness that would allow them the operating capital to continue or--or not receiving any benefit, they would prefer--they would like to have that opportunity? </p><p>COHEN: That's a tough choice. </p><p>BISHOP: Yeah. Okay.   </p><p>COHEN: A little bit of a Sophie's Choice there. I'm not sure. I mean, yes, I think most restauranteurs would like to stay open. But I also know that it seems like impossible to--to work with this unbelievable debt hanging over your head--  </p><p>BISHOP: --Right--  </p><p>COHEN: --at a time it seems like we might never be able to actually open up full capacity again.  </p><p>BISHOP: Yeah, thank you., Ms. Cohen. I think, ultimately, that choice is--that's gonna be hanging over somebody's head. Taxpayers or--or over the business owners. Thank you, Madam Chairman. My time is expired. I think we're just about. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman's time has expired. And now we recognize Mr. Schneider from Illinois. </p><p>SCHNEIDER: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And I want to thank you and the ranking member for having this hearing and obviously the witnesses for sharing your perspectives today. I know this is a difficult situation for everybody. For anyone who is going through the health crisis and has lost somebody, it's unfathomable. But it's also an economic crisis and the impact it's having on our businesses but in particular, our small businesses, as was noted earlier and I think it's somewhere upwards of 75 percent of all businesses have had a negative impact on their--their revenues on their business. </p><p>None more so, Ms. Cohen, than when you talk about in the restaurant industry, especially our local restaurants that are so much a part of the neighborhood, the communities that we all live in, and they're--they're struggling and I'm happy to be a co-sponsor of the Restaurant Act because I understand how important that is. But I also will say--you know, share that thought with Mr. Bishop, and, Mr. Palmer, thank you for saying it's not double dipping, that the law said that these businesses had an opportunity to get a loan up to $2 million dollars.  </p><p>And a $150,000 decision was an arbitrary decision, I often use the analogy is if you build a bridge halfway across the river, you may feel good for a while you're still gonna get wet and not make it to the other side. We've got to provide a bridge for our--our economy. Our economy is made up of the businesses and the workers in those businesses. We've got to be doing everything we can to help them. And, Ms. Cohen, what you were saying, I can't think of any small restaurant that's in a position to take on more debt. They're just trying to barely hang on, whether it's a takeout service, delivery service if you are able to open but it's gonna be fits and starts.  </p><p>And, Mr. Blackshaw, I loved your acronym VUCA, volatility, uncertainty, complexity, you might add chaos into it right now, and ambiguity. It's--it's a tough time and having been in business, I understand that. And we're looking forward and I forget who said it but the idea of an eight-month solution--or eight weeks solution for an 18-month problem is one of our challenges.  </p><p>So maybe I'll turn to the two business owners Ms. Cohen and Mr. Blackshaw, looking forward with this uncertainty. What can Congress do to help give some stability, some confidence to help you make the hard choices to risk capital, to risk--you know, your employees' future to try to make it to the other side? </p><p>COHEN: Well, first of all, thank you so much for supporting the Restaurant Act. I am deeply grateful for that. And not to sound like a broken record. But the best thing that Congress can do is support the Restaurant Act. Let's get more members to support the Restaurant Act. That is the only way that I know, and other restaurants know that we can open up safely. We don't have to put too many people in our dining room at once, we can keep our employees safe, and we can keep our customers say, </p><p>SCHNEIDER: Mr. Blackshaw, you're a different type of business. What would you suggest? </p><p>BLACKSHAW: Yeah, listen, I think anything Congress can do to reward, recognize, credential--you know, innovation in this environment is critically important. And some of that is just really, eyes wide open to what's already happening. I think there's a lot of the answers are out there, we just need to really smartly graph--you know, the ideas that are taking place, maybe in a--you know, a lesser-known area and turn it into a big national idea.  </p><p>I think that's what I love about the digital natives. You know, whether we like Tick Tock or Instagram or not, they're brilliant at finding sources of inspiration across the world and scaling it. And I think we have this golden opportunity to find those programs, those initiatives, those more for less ways of delivering services and turn them into big opportunities.  </p><p>So I think Congress can play a very, very key role shining a light on that. I think that the whole issue of like reinventing your platforms is so important. It's not enough to say that the SBA site is improving 20 percent per year because we've all in this VUCA world--you know, we've gone from like a hockey stick on how we use--you know, Zoom, and so the expectations are so much higher. And how do we bring out a clean sheet of paper on how services are delivered, how you apply for loans online, and it's all doable, we can learn. And I think a lot of these big tech players will probably gladly co-invest. I think they're looking for opportunities to show goodwill. And but I think they're also genuinely concerned on the issue and they bring know-how and I think Congress can really make a lot of those outcomes real. </p><p>SCHNEIDER: Thank you. And now, which is my last few seconds, thanks for that. I like the idea of the startup mentality. We need to create that startup, the challenges we face. So describing not just a hockey stick, it's a hockey stick on a spring bouncing on a trampoline. The rate of change is so dynamic and so fast. Government has to keep up. In fact, we need to make sure the SBA isn't just keeping up but leading the way and I look forward to working with my colleagues on this committee to try to do that. And I thank everyone I know how hard it is, hang in there. Keep working. Together we're gonna get through this crisis.  </p><p>Thanks so much. My time has expired. I yield back. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Gentleman's time has expired and now I recognize the gentlelady from Pennsylvania, Ms. Houlahan. </p><p>HOULAHAN: Hi, I hope that you can hear me.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Yes, we can hear you.  </p><p>HOULAHAN: And I would also like to echo my appreciation to the panelists and to the committee. And I know as an entrepreneur myself, how very, very difficult it is in the best of times to be an entrepreneur, and particularly, I can't even imagine how hard it is now. And so please take my questions just as questions because I'm trying to be as thoughtful and probative as I can be on behalf of the people that I represent.  </p><p>And so my first question is regarding the restaurant bill--you know, shortly after this call, I'll be going back and sitting with my team with a legislative lens on trying to figure out what bills to get behind and what bills not to get--to not get behind and let me just posit this to you. To Ms. Cohen possibly would probably be the most likely person to answer my question.  </p><p>Many, many, many businesses have a situation that you have right now where you've taken the PPP loan, you may or may not be able to use it or open on time, you may or may not have to go in and out of operating your business over this period of time. I'm just west of Philadelphia and my community just barely opened and may be closing back again--you know, within the foreseeable future. Businesses like a live venue, live theater are just a few of those things that I could name that need just as much help as the restaurant industry does but may not have quite as much of a lobbying power as the restaurant industry does.  </p><p>Why does this restaurant industry need the help different than any other company? And why wouldn't it be more appropriate perhaps if the PPP program has been effective, to be able to have triggered mechanisms, maybe for certain industries, maybe for certain regions or zip codes as we come in and out of this--this problem? Why wouldn't we better be of served by taking something that is working and tweaking it for everyone rather than one industry? </p><p>COHEN: Thank you so much for the question, Congresswoman. For one, PPP, even if it were to be extended, it's still just a bridge. It's not a long term solution for us. And the restaurant industry is uniquely completely reliant on social gatherings to generate revenue, which is why the pandemic and public health shutdown have affected us more than any other business. Unlike airlines or big retailers, independent restaurants do not have access to debt or capital markets. And as a result, independent restaurants face the perfect storm that will force more than 85 percent of them to close without intervention. That would be disastrous for our nation's roughly 500,000--500,000 independent restaurants and the over 11 million employees that they employ. </p><p>HOULAHAN: But wouldn't you--wouldn't you agree that something like live music or live theater or really almost anything live is in just as dire straits as your industry is? </p><p>COHEN: I am not advocating against any other industry receiving money, but I do think that we have less access to capital, in particular, independent restaurants. </p><p>HOULAHAN: And in the situation where you would be able to evolve the PPP loan to be able to be as it is currently if you use it a certain way, it is not alone, it is--it is a grant and there is forgiveness. Why wouldn't we do the same and have traunches--you know, have multiple times and multiple dips--and dips that--you know, as Representative--I believe it was, Bishop was talking about EIDL but actually genuinely in this case PPP multiple opportunities to access this bucket of capital with that not in the case where it to be converted to a grant would that not satisfy the restaurant industry and other industries similarly?  </p><p>COHEN: I cannot speak on behalf of under other industries, unfortunately.  </p><p>HOULAHAN: Sure.  </p><p>COHEN: But I think for restaurants, part of the PPP isn't about getting employees back on the payroll and it's predicated on that. And that's very hard for what I'm looking at for an 18-month problem where we're going to have employees come on and off. And I don't want to--on and off for payroll and I don't want to put employees back on my payroll and then have to take them off again. I'd rather slowly build up to a time where we can actually get fully up and running. </p><p>HOULAHAN: And I appreciate that, and I really don't mean to put you on the spot. I'm just trying to noodle over kind of what our opportunities are. Do any of the other panelists with the 39 seconds I have left have anything to add or offer to that question? </p><p>PALMER: I would add something is that it's you're right. It's not--I mean, restaurants are taking it on the chin, and they are massive employer. They're a significant local economic jobs multiplier. But there are other businesses that are put together staging or lighting on there really have taken it on the chin. So your proposal on having--you know, tailored PPP now that we have time to be thoughtful and deliberative about how we're going to structure these things make some sense. And this isn't--they still do the Restaurant Act. I know nothing about the Restaurant Act. But--but if we can be deliberate about how we define injury, what they can use it for, what their needs are, what they make it a deductible expense or a permitted expense under PPE for forgiveness, for example, to make your business safe if we're getting one of these loans.  </p><p>There's lots of things we can do. Or we can even--you know, for some of these other grant programs have it where there's no payments for the first two years. It's still a loan but there's no payments for the first two years because the 10-year Treasury right now is running at 20 basis points. You have a significant amount for a very small amount of time and then you pay payments after the first two years to give businesses a chance to recover that are currently totally shut down. There are lots of creative ways we can look at these things. But we do have the time but not a ton of time. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentlelady's time--  </p><p>HOULAHAN: --I yield back. I appreciate it. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Sure. And the gentlelady from Minnesota, Ms. Craig is recognized. </p><p>CRAIG: Thank you so much, Madam Chairwoman.  </p><p>I--Dr. Cook, I just want to maybe just make a quick comment on your point related to the health care crisis--the public health crisis that we're in here today. My point from day one has been that if we handle the public health crisis side of this well that the economic crisis will take care of itself. So I just wanted to say I heard you in your testimony and in your--your Q&amp;A about how critical it is that even though we're on the House Committee on Small Business, that the Congress continues to focus on coming up with a more robust strategy as it relates to how we handle the healthcare crisis of COVID-19.  </p><p>Ms. Cohen, I--I also wanted to say to you that I'm a strong supporter of the Restaurants Act. I'm on Representative Blumenauer's bill. My only regret is that I didn't author the bill first. So thank you for your advocacy of that bill. I did, however, introduce a bill that the chairwoman was kind enough to also become an original on that would allow folks who have seen a 50 percent reduction in revenue as a result of COVID-19 as well as have 100 or fewer employees to come back and get a second forgivable loan.  </p><p>Can you tell me how you think about a bill like that, which obviously, is less-industry specific, versus the Restaurants Act? And--and sort of compare and contrast the value of those two actions from the part of the Congress? </p><p>COHEN: Thank you so much for sponsoring the bill--our bill and I think that is actually terrific though. I think that the Restaurant Act takes care of more of our needs. And that it allows us to pay back our suppliers actually. Get us back up on our feet and not just put our money--I mean, putting our money into payroll is incredibly important, and I want to get all my 35 employees back on my payroll but I would also really, really like to be able to open my business and put money back into the economy through my suppliers. </p><p>CRAIG: Thank you so much for that. And I'll just a quick follow up for you is, I know, as we've reopened here in Minnesota, many of my restaurant owners, independent owners have been asked to undertake safety measures, obviously to keep customers more safe and limit the spread of COVID-19. I'm hearing from them even though they serve far fewer customers, that they're required--they're required to put in place higher staffing levels to open those doors.  </p><p>What can Congress and the SBA do to help lower those burdens, at the same time, ensuring that your employees and your customers remain safe? </p><p>COHEN: I'm not--I'm not sure what more of that that can be done. We do have to--we are--we have more people employed. For me personally, I have somebody who monitors the bathroom. We don't even have dine-in service. But I have guests who come in and I want to make sure that the bathroom is as clean as possible. That's not normal. I don't usually have a bathroom attendant in my 40-seat restaurant. So I'm not sure what more actually can be done unless we--you know, get money that we can specifically use for things like the PPP--PPE or for hiring those extra people, and extra cleaning. All those extra stuff. </p><p>CRAIG: Thank you so much. And I just really appreciate your advocacy on part--on the part of independent restaurants.  </p><p>And then finally Mr.--Mr. Palmer very quickly. Do you think certain industries moving forward will face unique post-COVID-19 into this recovery phase and--you know, any thoughts that you have on specifically what Congress can do to continue to help businesses recover? </p><p>PALMER: Absolutely. There's going to be definitive variations, hospitality and events, industries, anyone who has to do long-term planning because right now we just don't have any idea what two months are going to look--things would look like two months from now much less a year from now. I think we need to be providing patient capital as much as we can. I think Congress really needs to revisit our policies as it relates to manufacturing and domestic production.  </p><p>One of the things that came clear out of this is that our inability to create PPP and other critical infrastructure, the fact that we still can get Lysol disinfectant wipes in a--in a supermarket five months later because we don't have the chemicals or whatever is causing those type of shortages is kind of crazy. So I think we need to revisit our access to equity capital, patient capital, and really make sure we're making this as hospitable place for manual fracturing the United States. </p><p>CRAIG: Mr. Palmer. Thank you so much. I'm a founding member of the Supply Chain caucus of the Congress and who would have thought that that would be a sexy topic. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>PALMER: Thank you for doing it.  </p><p>CRAIG: With that, Madam Chairwoman, I yield back. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: The gentleman lady yields back and I will go to Mr. Mfume from Maryland if he has any questions. </p><p>MFUME: I do, and I hope everyone can hear me. Thank you for returning back to me, Madam Chair.  </p><p>I just have a couple of observations, which to me are significant and maybe even poignant. It was my pleasure to serve on this committee for 10 years doing my first stint in the Congress before I decided I would just voluntary leave and go do something else in life. But one of the things interesting about that is that much has changed and yet much still remains with respect to the topical areas that we are dealing with, Madam Chair. And I would, again, as I said earlier, this notion of lasting solutions is a key phrase because this will be over one day. The question becomes what happens to the small businesses of America.  </p><p>And lasting solutions are going to require ingenuity and creativity but also access to capital and access to credit, which was the major driving force in hearings like this in 1989 and throughout the '90s, Madam Chair, when you were a member of the committee. It's still a driving issue. And--you know, I think about SBICs which we created as a congress in 1958. And I think about all the other initiatives and I was very interested in hearing the phraseology about we need an SBA on steroids. We really do because we really always have needed that. But there's some other things that I would think observationally that we might want to consider as we go down the road on this topic in future hearings.  </p><p>One of which is that--and by the way, Mr. Palmer, I appreciate your--your--your commentary and your information. I would slightly disagree with you on one matter, you said that minority businesses in many instances were not applying for some of the structured loans and other programs that are out there, whether it's SBIC or something else because they didn't have--always have the knowledge. I would suggest to you that many have not applied because they know that they're going to get turned down as they have been turned down repeatedly over and over and over again.  </p><p>And so my argument here is that we have to be deliberate in terms of what we do going forward, that we need a deliberate tax policy, a deliberate banking policy, a deliberate SBA policy, that we've got to find a way to create small venture capital that someone said earlier, which is absolutely crucial. That is within the domain of the Congress itself. And we've got to look at some of the other smaller things like overly burdensome bonding requirements, the little things that create and push businesses sometimes to--to the edge.  </p><p>So I--I'm looking forward, Madam Chair, actually, to this discussion continuing and going on. And I appreciate your leadership and the leadership of the ranking member on this. It's something that has fascinated me for a long time. And now after having watched this unfold for the last 31, 32 years since I first took an oath of office, it's--it's perplexing how this issue is not only vexing but it is repeating itself over and over and over again.  </p><p>So there is a lot of work to do in this area. This notion about making sure that we're taking care of urban versus rural businesses is important also. I always say urban and rural and whether we're talking about minority-owned or women-owned businesses. There are a lot of niches here that we have the ability, I think, under your leadership in this committee to kind of cull together and put forward a kind of policy that many of our colleagues in the House would appreciate.  </p><p>So, again, Madam Chair, thank you very, very much for your leadership. I'm gonna stop filibustering as if I am on the other side of the building right now and yield back the time that I have.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you so much. And thank you for your contributions and your history of fighting for fairness and especially civil rights, criminal justice reform but how do we contribute to make an economy that is just for everyone in this country?  </p><p>Mr. Chabot, do you have any other question? Would you-- </p><p>CHABOT: You know, Madam Chair, I think has been a very interesting hearing. I think the witnesses did a great job all of them and learned a lot and hopefully, on a bipartisan basis, we'll put some of this into action. So thank you for holding this. </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Thank you. Thank you. And let me just say, to all the panelists, thank you for your contributions, shedding light into what is happening and helping us put together an agenda that really reflects the unprecedented crisis that we are witnessing.  </p><p>And--you know, people love to say that small businesses are the backbone of America, that small businesses is the engine that fuel our economy. And this is the time that it has shown that they need help. Otherwise, a lot of them are going to close their doors forever.  </p><p>And Dr. Cook, I'm going to take an opportunity here in my closing remarks to ask you a question. And there are two issues that I--I just want to raise on one was raised by Mr. Bishop. He is frustrated because the EIDL program provides for loans of up to $2 million. However, the administration never expected the unprecedented numbers of applications--of loans application, and rather than coming back to us to ask for an increase in the funding for the EIDL, they decided to cut it to $150,000. But we are working on bipartisan legislation that will--that will address this issue.  </p><p>And Dr. Cook right now there is like $130 billion in the pipeline regarding the PPP. And I would like to see that 50 percent of that money is carved out for minority businesses and women-owned businesses. One of the issues that we are confronting is that we don't know how well the PPP is working because the data was not provided to us until last Friday at midnight. But not only that, by going through the data, we are finding a lot of errors.  </p><p>So what--how do you assess the possibility of us setting aside 50 percent of the $130 billion so that mission-based lenders will have an opportunity to make those loans? What impact will that have? </p><p>COOK: I think that would be critical. And I think it would be critical for--for several reasons. They were at the back of the line for many reasons that Ms. Cohen was outlining but also because of these historical relationships because of what Congressman Mfume was talking about these--the systemic issues that have not yet been addressed.  </p><p>But I think that yes, setting aside 50 percent, I think would be extremely useful. But I think the other thing that is being missed here--I'm sorry, I didn't say it earlier is that the micro-enterprises, the newest businesses are where innovation comes from in America. And they are also being left behind. So we could have a permanent ding on--on economic growth if we're not attending to those that don't yet have relationships with banks.  </p><p>So I think for minorities, for the smallest businesses, I think we really have to do more, and they should be grant-based. There can't be this uncertainty that Ms. Cohen is talking about because they don't have the capacity to--to figure all this stuff out and we shouldn't put that burden on them.  </p><p>VELAZQUEZ: Right and micro--microlenders provide capacity building for those businesses. So we fought to get them as part of the mission-based lender in the second traunch of money that we passed.  </p><p>Well, let me again thank all the witnesses for your participation. I look forward to working together as a committee to help guide our country's small-business owners through this unprecedented times. I ask unanimous consent that members have five legislative days to submit statements and supporting materials for the record. Without objection, so ordered. And if there's no further business before the committee, we are adjourned. Thank you. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CN-KBY1-JDPT-T0NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

We provide services to hundreds of entrepreneurs and manage a 38,000 sq ft co-working space in Cincinnati's urban core. We also unlock innovation through $115 million in invested capital from corporations such as P&amp;G, Kroger, Western &amp; Southern, and EW Scripps. As for me, I've launched and sold a tech startup and recently served as Global Head of Digital for Nestle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I have just one core message that I'd like to share with you today: the best way to help small business owners thrive in this uncertain world is to help them think and act like startups -- the entrepreneurs who are disrupting every part of our economy and, in the process, creating new jobs, game-changing technologies, and new, better ways to live and work.</p><p>When I say startups, I don't necessarily mean Silicon Valley. Or Ivy League entrepreneurs raising millions in venture capital. I'm referring to the new generation of entrepreneurs taking on big, unsolved problems... in every sector of our society ... and turning them on their head.</p><p>Many of these startup founders are women and minorities. And they're coming from well beyond the East and West Coasts; a huge number are stepping up throughout the Midwest.</p><p>They are harnessing digital technology, connectivity, and \"distributed everything\" to create new business models, new solutions, and new companies designed for the age of disruption.</p><p>Which is a point I want to underscore: we ARE living in an age of unending disruption - in which economic, social, health-related shocks -- are going to become more common.</p><p>Some people call this a VUCA world -- volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. A VUCA world requires VUCA leadership - precisely what a startup mindset enables.</p><p>To be clear, there are urgent needs that small business owners need help with right now. Paycheck protection. Access to capital. Streamlined regulations and policies. They're all critical and necessary. But</p><p>we must also look beyond the present to a future that is going to be even more demanding than the moment we're living in today. And do so with urgency!</p><p>Many people talk about re-skilling - or even UP-skilling -- as a way to prepare for the new economy. Neither is enough! We also need STARTUP-SKILLING -- teaching and empowering small business owners to think and act like startups in times of crisis AND in times of growth.</p><p>What does this mean? A startup mindset is different than a conventional leadership mindset. It prizes speed, rapid prototyping, constant iteration, and failing fast to learn fast. It is obsessed with data, what to see in it, and how to exploit it. It's digital, and it thrives on pivots.</p><p>STARTUP-SKILLING should become a national priority -- led by the SBA and involving corporations, universities and startup ecosystems. The Kaufmann Foundation has called for the creation of an \"e-Corps\" -- a Peace Corps of sorts for digital natives. I love that idea, but let's focus it disproportionally on STARTUP-SKILLING for small businesses. And get it going NOW.</p><p>What does STARTUP-SKILLING look like?</p><p>First, it's about showing small business owners how they can apply startup thinking, technologies and practices to their own ventures.</p><p>For example, at Cintrifuse we hosted a program called Nitro! in partnership with JP Morgan Chase. Over ONE weekend, we \"startup-skilled\" several dozen minority-led businesses -- entrepreneurs who are vastly under-served and under-resourced throughout every community. We gave them access to mentors. We showed them how to leverage technology. We brought in Google. We taught them the principles of startup leadership.</p><p>This should be a signature SBA program. We need thousands of NITRO! Weekends across America. Every weekend!! Not just to support small business owners, but to turbocharge our support for minority and women-led small businesses in particular! We also need to support other existing efforts like Mortar, the minority-focused startup accelerator you heard last year.</p><p>We're also seeing movement in \"micro-credentialing\" aimed at urban and rural areas. Miami University in Ohio is one such school developing more accessible micro-credentialing targeted at starting a new enterprise and including basic skills in accounting, finance, and marketing. Faculty are deployed well beyond the Ivory Tower to the actual communities in need.</p><p>Second, it's about learning from Digital Natives -- the kids who've grown up being digital. With sponsorship from our corporate partners, Cintrifuse is sponsoring a \"virtual entrepreneurial program\" for high school and college students -- as we speak, in fact!</p><p>We targeted 50 students. We got 100. They're developing startup ideas to help address pressing challenges created by Covid, by Sustainability, and by Social Justice issues. We're challenging them to explore ways in which radically more transparent supply chains - driven by breakthrough innovations in areas like traceability - might be part of a better future.</p><p>In other words, they're taking on big unsolved problems. And they're thinking beyond big companies and tech startups to the role small businesses can play in our own back yard.</p><p>Third, it's about \"mobilizing\" and \"re-platforming\" small business services.</p><p>I spent hours before this testimony reviewing dozens of government and SBA digital properties, apps, and more. I've applied for PPP help. I've read web comments. I'm convinced the SBA needs a digital startup infusion.</p><p>Why not build an \"open innovation\" platform to crowd-source solutions? And why not take greater advantage of audience-rich \"big tech\" - Google, Microsoft, Amazon. Facebook, for example, has more than three billion users including TENS OF MILLIONS of small business owners. This platform is taking heat for reasons I'll refrain from discussing, but why not invite them to co-develop a next generation hub for small business services and startup-skilling. Not a page or an ad campaign, but SBA.com on steroids. What a win-win!</p><p>Final observation: I truly believe there's little distinction between a tech startup and a mom and pop small business. They are both based on an idea, a problem that needs to be solved, an entrepreneurial spirit, and the desire to take a shot and carve your own path. Whether we're talking about scalable technology or small-town service, we're talking about the same thing: businesses built on the ingenuity, passion and persistence of people who simply want to make our country better by finding a better way. That's American entrepreneurialism.</p><p>We have a \"pivot moment\" to both support small businesses in crisis AND to accelerate their ability to think and act like the startups that are changing the world.</p><p>My bumper-sticker? Let's STARTUP-SKILL America!!</p><p>If we meet this moment, we will inspire, grow and unleash the most diverse, innovative and resilient generation of entrepreneurs in American history.

Investigating Big Tech's Impact on Small Business\":</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I am Jake Ward, president of the Connected Commerce Council (3C), a small business membership organization that promotes small businesses' access to essential digital technologies and tools.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"On behalf of digitally-empowered small businesses nationwide, thank you for holding this important hearing, and thank you for inviting 3C to participate. Your exploration of Big Tech's impact on small business is extraordinarily valuable because you understand small business; you are the champions of small business. I encourage you to consider these issues carefully and to voice your opinions loudly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Today I will use our time together to share what I have learned from thousands of 3C small business people.</p><p>\"3C supports small businesses as a resource and an advocate. We promote access to and adoption of digital technologies and tools; provide resources and education to help optimize small businesses' digital opportunity; and cultivate a policy environment that considers and respects small businesses. 3C wants small businesses to succeed and we believe that digital technologies and tools give small businesses the best opportunity to succeed. A recent Deloitte study found that effective use of digital technology by small businesses resulted in markedly higher revenue, substantially greater profitability, and many more jobs created.</p><p>\"At 3C, we spend most of our time talking to and supporting small businesses. We have hosted SkillsConnect workshops nationwide, including in New York, Cincinnati, Boulder, Brooklyn, Sacramento, and Austin. We have been pleased to welcome Chairwoman Velasquez and Representative Chabot to our events so you can meet our members and hear their stories.</p><p>\"In many ways, 3C member businesses differ from one another. They include restaurants, authors and publishers, executive coaches, plumbing companies, inventors, hand-made leather goods producers, owners of small inns, wineries, print shops, and manufacturers. Yet in some important ways, their stories sound the same. If our member companies were here today, they would tell you that data-intensive digital platforms and marketplaces - including Google, Facebook, and Amazon as well as Etsy, eBay, Yelp, Pinterest, TripAdvisor, Walmart.com, Houzz, QuickBooks and many more - benefit their businesses, help them compete, and accelerate their success.</p><p>\"Digital technology, digital platforms, and digital tools help small businesses start, grow and succeed in previously unimaginable ways - not only locally but way beyond traditional geographic limitations. Digital advertising and online marketing help small companies find new customers - globally and cost-efficiently. Data helps small businesses serve more customers at a lower cost. The digital cloud helps small businesses reduce paperwork, reduce their environmental footprint, and go on vacation while remaining available to colleagues and customers. Digital marketplaces help small businesses sell more products locally and globally.</p><p>* A 3C member in Iowa invented a retractable fabric gate to keep toddlers safe, and another member in Utah invented an all-in-one bedding set that makes it easy for kids (and adults) to make their bed every morning. As a startup, breaking into traditional retail and competing against global giants is almost impossible, so these entrepreneurs built simple websites and used Facebook posts and Google advertisements to find their first customers. Years later, digital marketing and data science still drive their growth and success. These companies employ dozens of people and has customers worldwide.</p><p>* A Columbus, Ohio print shop and an Arizona sports accessories retailer offer thousands of products in their online stores and compete against industry giants. Two decades ago, they would have been local shops with local customers; today they are small and global simultaneously.</p><p>* Several 3C members manage family-owned restaurants. They work with Yelp, Google, TripAdvisor, and Facebook to attract customers, manage their reputations and share specials and coupons, and they receive almost immediate feedback on whether their efforts are effective. Without digital platforms and tools, these restaurants would struggle to compete against big chain restaurants.</p><p>\"These are not simply feel-good stories or digital innovation stories. They relate directly to this hearing and the policy issues this Committee and others are considering because, in so many respects, the digital platforms and tools powering small businesses are provided by some of the world's largest companies, and several of those companies are being criticized and investigated.</p><p>\"Through the course of history, disruptive innovation has challenged incumbent industries. The combustion engine challenged horse-drawn carriages, the airplane challenged passenger and freight trains, and digital music challenged traditional record companies. Fortunately, policymakers in those times carefully scrutinized the complaints of then-powerful economic incumbents, and the inventions that once caused angst and turbulence were not over-regulated out of existence, and are now accepted as status quo.</p><p>\"With respect to this hearing and many of the digital economy investigations, 3C's concern is that policymakers, competition regulators, thought leaders and headline writers are focusing only on the largest companies, the loudest voices, and assertions of negative impacts or challenges when considering how to regulate the digital economy. It is so easy to say \"big is bad,\" to hear the wailing laments of incumbent businesses and industries, and to take for granted the opportunity and access to opportunity that deserves celebration and protection.</p><p>\"3C is also concerned that policymakers too often talk about small businesses rather than listen to them. For example, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission held several hearings about the digital economy and whether antitrust law should be reconsidered, and not a single small business or small business organization was invited to testify. 3C and our members thank Chairwoman Velasquez and Representative Chabot for sending a letter to the FTC calling attention to that glaring oversight.</p><p>\"The challenge of every small business is unique but their stories are universal. Unleashing the potential of American small business now requires access to affordable, secure, and scalable broadband and digital tools. It also requires policymakers to understand that the digital economy is a different type of interconnected and interdependent economy where the investment of global platforms have direct, tangible local benefits, and the value of access to digital tools is measured in new employees and increased financial security.</p><p>\"As I noted earlier, there are many more digital platforms than the Big Three or Big Four that so many people think about - Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. QuickBooks supports homebased entrepreneurs and small businesses. John Deere's Precision Agriculture solutions work wonders for small farmers. Pinterest and Houzz support and promote home decoration and renovation products, designers and contractors. These companies collect, aggregate and analyze vast quantities of data - safely, securely and affordably - and deliver the power of data science to small businesses that could not do this or afford this in virtually any other way.</p><p>\"The idea that regulators and policymakers are gleefully investigating free and low-cost services that power small business success mystifies 3C members. Just last week a longtime Google critic pointed out that the government investigation targets are not \"Big Tech,\" but rather are those companies whose business model is to provide \"purportedly free services in exchange for massive and unconstrained collection of consumer data untethered to the underlying service.\" Perhaps this critic does not recall the days of \"free\" broadcast television and broadcast radio, when large companies paid writers, directors, news reporters and actors billions of dollars to create \"free programming\" that was really just an advertising platform in disguise. Or free and low-cost newspapers that gave away information about City Hall and town meetings as subterfuge to sell advertisements. And should we investigate grocery stores? Are they massive corporate conglomerates providing us with discount fruits and vegetables as a ruse to sell shelf space and endcaps? Are they offering loyalty cards and gasoline discounts as a scheme to collect our data to sell coupons and in-store advertising? For decades inventors and entrepreneurs have struggled to get new products into traditional retail stores. Sophisticated corporate buyers now demand up-front payments for in-store sampling stations and upend the traditional wholesale model by refusing to pay for products until they are purchased by consumers. These \"free experiences\" that are offered to consumers - like malls and department stores - have become data-driven multi-sided markets that mercilessly exploit retail tenants, food and health care companies and especially the entrepreneurs who rent kiosks to launch a new business.</p><p>\"Let's take a moment to dig more into the retail industry. It was only a few years ago when Federated was buying Marshall Field, Macy's, Hecht and many more local anchor retail chains, and then squeezing more discounts and imposing more burdens on local manufacturers - if they were even allowed to sell product in those stores. Amazon did not invent or even perfect private label products that compete against their suppliers. Private label products were invented in the 19th century by merchants who recognized that customers would welcome lower-cost highquality alternatives. The Wishbone brand that we know for salad dressing started as a private label brand in a Springfield, IL grocery store owned by Jacob Bunn - the same Jacob Bunn who sold the Mary Todd brand of coffee and went on to manage the political campaign of his good friend, Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>\"Retail brands that we all know (though some have disappeared) started as private label sellers. In 1858 R.H. Macy opened its first department store, and in its first century it produced and sold more than 4000 private-label branded products - hoop skirts, wrapping paper, sewing machines - the list is endless. Today Macy's still sells hundreds of high-quality competitively-priced private label products.</p><p>\"Other stores took a different route. A&amp;#38;P established a retail presence and then created \"Eight O'Clock Breakfast Coffee.\" Sears built a retail presence and then, in 1927, created Craftsman tools. I am sure that independent tool manufacturers were unhappy that a large customer was now competing with them, but did they run to Congress and Attorneys General for relief, or did they instead build their brands and adjust their pricing strategies? Certainly, Amazon is not the first retailer, or even the first large retailer, to build a private label business on the foundation of in-store data. CVS, Walgreen's and every grocery chain in America got there first.</p><p>\"Fortunately for inventors and small manufacturers, Amazon has unlimited shelf space and small companies can advertise and market independently to drive customers to their Amazon product page, or to their product page on Etsy, eBay, Walmart.com, or their own website. With Amazon and other e-commerce partners, entrepreneurs can test market new products, prices, colors, and features without ever building or shipping a product and without begging or paying off a corporate retail buyer for shelf space.</p><p>\"It is indisputable that large digital platforms, services, and marketplaces provide small businesses with affordable, scalable and secure business solutions. What is not equally understood is that these solutions are affordable, scalable, and secure because of the platforms' relative size. It is because of their size and scale that platforms have the capital to invest and the flexibility to price so that small businesses have a pathway to viability, growth, and success. Without the large platforms, these services would not exist or would not be affordable to 3C member small businesses.</p><p>\"We are living in an extraordinary era for entrepreneurs and small businesses. When new products, marketing campaigns, and advertising creative can be tested online for less than $100, there is virtually no barrier to starting a business or introducing a new product. But if the large digital platforms are broken up and each business unit would need to be individually profitable or pay the other business units for data or data solutions, there would be significantly fewer free or low-cost tools and services available to small businesses, prices would increase and effectiveness would diminish. That would reduce small business formation; undermine small business innovation; and hurt families in nationwide.</p><p>\"It is also notable that large digital companies compete aggressively against each other. Some 3C members spend more money on Facebook and Instagram; others think Google is a better partner; and still, others focus on Amazon and Pinterest. Moreover, new competitors are entering the market every day and driving innovation. Each of the platforms is investing in new and better small business offerings, and small businesses and their hometowns benefit.</p><p>\"A common theme of 3C companies - the power of technology and data - connects directly to today's hearing. Unleashing the potential of rural America requires unleashing the potential of digital tools, access to data, and the power of data science for rural America. For many years, policymakers and thought leaders have discussed the digital divide as a broadband access issue and focused attention on how underserved communities would benefit from inexpensive access to broadband. These are legitimate concerns, but 3C's focus is the next question: once broadband and digital tools are available, how can small businesses maximize the opportunity? The reality of the digital economy is that our members - and nearly 30 million small businesses like them - stand on the shoulders of large companies to reach otherwise unattainable heights.</p><p>\"Platforms invest in scalable, secure, and affordable tools. Marketplaces connect buyers with sellers. Small businesses leverage these tools and marketplaces to start, build, and grow. The guiding principles of the digital economy - speed and scale - consistently drive shared value and mutual benefit for small businesses. Innovative technologies and approaches are widely available, easily adopted, and improved quickly. Our public officials must take great care to ensure that policies focused on the largest digital companies do not inadvertently undermine small business opportunity.</p><p>\"It is impossible to overstate the billions of dollars in small business value and the millions of small business jobs supported by some of America's largest digital companies, including eBay, Etsy, Amazon, Square, Intuit, FreshBooks, Google, Constant Contact and Facebook. Some of these companies are much larger than others, but all provide extraordinary and low-cost platforms and tools to small businesses. This committee, other federal policymakers, and competition regulators must not overlook this.</p><p>\"We cannot afford to lose the forest through the trees, focusing our attention on only the largest and more prominent companies and issues. Rather, we should try to take the perspective of a small business, seeing the full landscape as we consider who will ultimately pay the price if business models are dramatically changed, costly regulations are enacted, or access to essential tools is limited.</p><p>\"On behalf of the tens of millions of digitally-empowered American small businesses, thank you for welcoming 3C today. We look forward to working with you and your colleagues to lower technological barriers to small business success, to strengthen competition and to continue promoting small business opportunity.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6930002 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6930002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ4-SKM1-DYG2-R0Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2705\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Investigating Big Tech's Impact on Small Business\":</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"No one can doubt that digital platforms, including \"big tech\" platforms such as Google, Amazon, and social media platforms such as Facebook, have created enormous opportunities for small businesses. Not only have these services allowed small businesses to extend their existing reach, but they have also created exciting new opportunities for entirely new small businesses. YouTube (owned by Google) and Twitch (owned by Amazon) have allowed tens of thousands of people to make their living through content creation, forming small businesses employing others./1</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Online shopping sites such as Amazon, Etsy and eBay have not only expanded the reach of traditional merchants, but also created new business opportunities for resellers and local distributors that suit local community needs. The Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Communities of Lakewood and Brooklyn, for example, has found that signing up as Amazon partners offers them flexibility that is well suited to the religious restrictions of Sabbath and religious holidays./2</p><p>\"At the same time, the dominance of a handful of massive companies in online retail, online search, online video and social media creates enormous problems for small businesses. These problems can be divided into two categories. First, small businesses face potential obstacles when they potentially compete with digital platforms. For example, there have been repeated reports that Amazon harvests information from third party vendors to develop competing products/3 (Amazon claims it does not do this and has no incentive to do so).</p><p>\"There is evidence from leaked emails that Facebook used its control over application programming interfaces (APIs) to block competitors and extort concessions from app developers once it reached dominance in the social media market./4</p><p>\"In 2017, the European Commission antitrust authority found that Google violated EU antitrust laws by favoring its affiliated content in its \"Google shopping\" service./5</p><p>\"Importantly, however, small businesses that use digital platforms as necessary inputs for their businesses can face enormous costs and barriers to entry even when they do not compete against the platform. Giant platforms, lacking competition and focused on maximizing their own revenue and preserving their own quality of service, can cause havoc with small businesses through poorly implemented decisions or imposing cumbersome and expensive processes. For example, rivals have been known to sabotage each other on platforms such as Amazon and YouTube with fake complaints, forcing small businesses to undertake expensive and complicated appeals processes./6</p><p>\"Changes in monetization policies or search algorithms can cause small businesses - through no fault of their own - to experience a sudden unanticipated drop in revenue./7</p><p>\"Changes in policy by giants such as Amazon can force smaller platforms such as Etsy to change their own policies to compete, shifting costs to the small merchants that use these rival platforms./8</p><p>\"In other words, giant platforms present a danger to small businesses not simply when they deliberately try to put them at a disadvantage. Like the proverbial bull in the china shop, giant digital platforms are simply incapable of controlling how even their rational business decisions can have unanticipated and disastrous impacts on the small businesses dependent on them. It therefore lies with Congress to set necessary safeguards that balance providing a stable and competitive environment for small businesses while preserving the valuable features of digital platforms.</p><p>Lessons From The Physical World and the Last 150 Years of Communications Policy</p><p>\"In the physical world, there is a well-developed body of law to prevent both deliberate anticompetitive conduct and to prevent providers of necessary business inputs from distorting the market. For example, there is an entire body of commercial real estate law that prevents landlords from unilaterally changing the terms on small businesses with no notice. A shopping mall owner could not, for example, simply lock a merchant out of their store for some presumed violation of the shopping mall's policy. But most digital platforms can - and do - shut down online merchants or impose various other penalties for purported infractions without any sort of notice or appeal process./9</p><p>\"There are rules that govern necessary inputs such as telecommunications or electricity so that providers of these vital services cannot squeeze merchants dependent on them into agreeing to onerous terms and conditions. But there are no such rules in the digital space. To the contrary, small businesses are left vulnerable in the online world in ways they have not been in the real world for over a century.</p><p>\"Below, I discuss important reforms Congress should consider to protect small businesses in cyberspace comparable to those they enjoy today in the physical world.</p><p>\"While we must increase antitrust enforcement and improve antitrust law, we must also recognize the limits of antitrust law.</p><p>\"In my book The Case for the Digital Platform Act,/10 I argue that the rise of digital platforms reflects the latest iteration of disruptive communications technology. In the 150 years since the telegraph revolutionized every aspect of society from commerce to foreign relations to news reporting, society observed how dramatic changes in communications technology produce equally dramatic and disruptive changes in society.</p><p>\"This should come as no surprise. At heart, all human interaction that creates society and commerce is communication. When society changes the nature of how people communicate, then society also changes the nature of how people do business. At the same time, however, society's fundamental values guide how people address these challenges. Our commitment to democracy, competition, consumer protection and public safety provide the necessary foundation for how our laws respond to the challenges these new communication technologies create.</p><p>\"Below, I summarize the relevant sections and recommendations for the committee. First, I discuss the importance of defining digital platforms and distinguishing between \"dominant\" and \"non-dominant\" platforms. Behavior that is neutral, or even pro-consumer or pro-competitive, when done by a small business in a competitive environment can be harmful when done by a dominant firm. This is particularly true in the digital platform space because of the enormous network effects that dominant digital platforms enjoy and the susceptibility of digital markets to \"tipping.\"/11</p><p>\"Next, I make specific recommendations for legislative remedies that Congress could adopt, either individually or as part of a package, to create a new \"digital authority\" as recommended both in The Case for the Digital Platform Act and by several recent expert reports. I will focus specifically on measures to protect small businesses from anti-competitive conduct by platforms, certain pro-competitive regulations such as interoperability, how \"filter bubbles\" and other problems with search and recommendation algorithms harm small businesses, and protections against arbitrary treatment. Finally, I will discuss how antitrust law can and cannot promote a digital environment in which small businesses can thrive.</p><p>Defining Digital Platforms and What Constitutes \"Dominance\" In The Digital Platform Space</p><p>\"Nearly every business today incorporates digital technology. Additionally, numerous businesses with radically different business models claim for various reasons to be \"platforms\" or digital platforms. Should the law treat businesses such as Google Search and other online businesses such as Netflix, or internet access providers such as Verizon or Comcast, the same? What distinguishes a would-be digital platform such as WeWork from a genuine digital platform such as Twitter? Defining what makes this particular sector of the economy unique makes clear the impact of \"big tech\" (as distinguishable from \"big business\" generally) on small businesses. In the last year, in addition to my own analysis, three separate expert reports have reached similar conclusions on what distinguishes digital platforms from other businesses./12</p><p>\"First, digital platforms do not provide internet access themselves. Instead, they are available through the internet. This radically changes the cost structure and enables rapid growth not possible for physical networks such as ISPs. Second, digital platforms enjoy powerful network effects. There is some argument as to what factors are most significant in creating these network effects, but they include: the ability of the platform to enable multisided markets and self-organizing subnetworks networks (e.g., users can be simultaneously buyers and sellers, can create multiple distinct groups, and can engage in multiple activities on the same platforms simultaneously); platforms can use personal information to manipulate users without their knowledge; and platforms can achieve a sufficient head start over rivals that it becomes almost impossible for new entrants to directly challenge the dominant platform (\"tipping point economies\").</p><p>\"These factors also create tremendous benefits for users. Collecting personal information enables platforms to customize features for enhanced service efficiency.</p><p>\"Delivering service via the internet enables platforms to provide \"always on\" service (even if, as in the case of online shopping, goods and services may be delivered offline, they may be ordered at any time). The ability of users to self-organize and to simultaneously occupy multiple roles on the platform enables users (and small businesses) to enjoy unique business and social opportunities. At the same time, however, these attributes create the potential for tremendous competitive harms.</p><p>The Difference Between Net Neutrality and Search Neutrality</p><p>\"For political reasons, industry lobbyists over the years have sought to conflate internet access providers and \"edge\" providers such as digital platforms. These two businesses have radically different cost structures and business models. While the history of telecommunications (including broadband) provides useful information about networked industries centered on human speech, rote mechanical application of rules governing one business to the other is a recipe for disaster. It would be like applying the same regulations to airplanes and buses because \"both are passenger vehicles for transportation.\" The difference between digital platforms that use the internet and broadband providers that offer access to the internet is best illustrated by the difference between what \"neutrality\" means in the internet access context and the search context. As a principle of ensuring reliability and avoiding anticompetitive conduct, the basic concept of non-discrimination works reasonably well. But consider the difference in application between an internet service provider and a search engine.</p><p>\"An ISP simply delivers information from one location to another - classic telecommunications, generally referred to as \"common carrier.\" For \"neutrality\" to apply in this context, the ISP needs to reliably deliver the information without any artificial distinction in service. The user buys transmission, the ISP provides it. Nothing more is required for the system to function, and the users on either end of the connection desire nothing more than that the system work in the same reliable way every time.</p><p>\"Now consider a search engine. What would it mean for a search engine to be a \"common carrier\"? The entire point of a search engine is to help a user sort through the billions of potential pieces of information available so that the user can find the most relevant information. This is entirely different from the function the user wants from the ISP, where the user already knows the information they want transmitted. It is like the difference between the telephone and an information directory. A person used to dial \"411\" to speak to a human being to help them sort through information to find the phone number, and the human at the information desk would then use the phone system to connect him.</p><p>\"This does not mean that concepts of \"nondiscrimination\" or \"neutrality\" have no application to search (either in a search engine such as Google or a recommendation algorithm such as a Facebook newsfeed). It is simply that they must express themselves in very different ways, and that mechanically applying the definition of \"neutrality\" from telecommunications to digital platforms would be a disaster. In the context of digital platforms such as search, as I discuss in greater detail below, nondiscrimination requires a certain level of transparency as to the nature of the search criteria and prohibiting selfdealing or deception. For example, Amazon was accused recently of altering its recommendation algorithm to make recommendations based on what products would be most profitable to Amazon, rather than on correlations with consumer preferences./13</p><p>\"This violates \"neutrality\" to the detriment of small businesses trying to compete directly with the platform.</p><p>\"As this illustration shows, trying to compare the behavior of infrastructure providers such as ISPs or cloud storage providers to those of digital platforms is a recipe for bad policy outcomes. Legislative solutions should be designed to level the playing field between small businesses and big tech, not between big tech and big telecom.</p><p>\"Measuring the Cost of Exclusion. One of the difficulties in addressing market power is how to measure dominance. The term \"digital platforms\" covers a wide range of businesses, with giant platforms potentially able to impact or influence small businesses in ways traditional antitrust law has difficulty defining. Additionally, for a remedy to protect small businesses effectively, it must either blunt the impact of a dominant platform's actions or reduce the market power of a digital platform so that new entrants can compete.</p><p>\"Additionally, behaviors that are anticompetitive in dominant firms may be procompetitive in smaller firms. Again, rote mechanical application of the same rules and standards does not produce fairness or a \"level playing field.\" The law imposes additional obligations on dominant firms as a remedy to their exceptional market power and as a mechanism for promoting competition. Once the market becomes competitive and the previously dominant firm becomes non-dominant, the additional safeguards imposed to limit abuses of market power can be removed. But it requires a reasonable test of dominance to avoid removing these safeguards prematurely - especially in a market subject to tipping, such as this one.</p><p>\"I have proposed the cost of exclusion from the platform (COE) as the appropriate measure of dominance. As I explain in greater detail in The Case for the Digital Platform Act, once a platform achieves a sufficient size, businesses suffer a significant, nontransient harm from losing access to the platform (either losing literal access through deplatforming, or by effectively disappearing as a result of being degraded in search results and disappearing from recommendations as a consequence of anticompetitive discrimination). The measurable cost of exclusion from the platform can be considered a measure of a platforms market power. If a small business can walk away from a platform with little loss of potential business, then the platform should not be considered dominant. On the other hand, if losing access to the platform can mean a significant drop in revenue or significant increase in expense, then the platform has significant market power and should be considered dominant.</p><p>\"Use of COE illustrates why small businesses require protection even from unintended consequences of dominant firms. When YouTube changes its monetization policy, for example, the impact is felt by tens of thousands of small content creators./14</p><p>\"Facebook's decision to prioritize \"quality engagement\" rather than extreme content in its newsfeed and recommendations had enormous impact on news outlets that had - for better or worse - optimized their headlines and coverage around Facebook's previous algorithm./15</p><p>\"Even though moving away from an emphasis on \"engagement\" that placed greater value to more extreme content over more informative content was a positive change made in response to widespread criticism, the way in which it was done created significant disruption for thousands of news outlets and content creators unprepared for the change.</p><p>\"Finally, recent actions by Amazon illustrate how dominant firms can directly target vulnerable small businesses to offload costs and to deny small businesses access to competing platforms at more favorable terms. For example, Amazon has been accused of penalizing sellers when their products are available for lower prices on Walmart.com./16</p><p>\"This summer, Amazon imposed a new refund policy that requires merchants who do not ship through Amazon to accept returned merchandise in the same way sellers who use Amazon do. This leaves businesses that feel they cannot leave Amazon with two choices: eat the cost or switch to Amazon's delivery service./17</p><p>\"To be clear, this does not mean that dominant firms should be locked into the same technology or same set of algorithms forever. Rather, this highlights the need to impose due process obligations on dominant platforms to ensure that small businesses have the stability they need to thrive.</p><p>Measures to Promote Competition: The Case for the Digital Platform Act.</p><p>\"Several recent reports have urged creation of a new \"digital authority\" to promote competition in the digital platform space./18</p><p>\"Public Knowledge similarly believes that the digital platform sector is sufficiently important to the economy and to society generally to require a specialized agency empowered to affirmatively promote competition, protect consumers, ensure a robust marketplace of ideas, and protect public safety. Congress has historically moved cautiously in expanding sector specific regulation. Our recommendations are therefore designed to work individually as well as in combination.</p><p>\"Data portability. One important feature in digital platform dominance is the collection and use of personal data from customers. This is particularly important for small businesses trying to maintain relationships with customers. Requiring platforms to honor requests from customers to move data to other platforms in usable formats has been recommended by many experts as a way to enhance competition./19</p><p>\"In the small business context, it would enable customers to move information from the platform to the small business if the customer chooses, decreasing dependence on the platform intermediary, in addition to moving information to businesses that directly compete with the platform.</p><p>\"Open APIs, licensing essential patents, and interoperability. Interoperability is critically important for application developers. Disturbing reports of Facebook's \"Switcheroo\" plan detail how Facebook initially encouraged application developers to invest in Facebook applications with the understanding that they would have continued access to the necessary application interfaces./20</p><p>\"Once Facebook achieved dominance, it used its power over these developers to extract concessions, such as requiring the app developers to spend over $300,000 in advertising on Facebook's mobile platform or lose access./21</p><p>\"Public Knowledge proposes eliminating significant barriers to interoperability for competitors and for businesses using a platform as an essential input. For example, content creators should be able to use the same applications to create content for diverse platforms such as YouTube, Twitch and Facebook without worrying that one of the important platforms will take steps to force them into proprietary applications. The history of the telecommunications industry shows that interconnection creates competition and creates stability for small businesses, since they can use interconnected competitors to access reliably their customers on competing platforms.</p><p>\"For the same reason, Public Knowledge recommends that companies that hold patents or copyrights that are essential to industry standards be required to license their intellectual property on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND). This does not mean that intellectual property holders must make their IP available for free. But FRAND licensing has been an important tool to prevent firms from using their IP to freeze out potential competitors or impose terms that prevent others from developing new, disruptive business models./22</p><p>\"Restricting use of information collected from commercial rivals and prohibiting \"most favored nation\" clauses. When small businesses use digital platforms, they expose some of their most sensitive proprietary information to the platform. Indeed, for the relationship to work, the platform must \"know\" details such as the popularity of a specific product, whether or not there are returns, and customer billing information. A platform may also legitimately require proof of quality control and proof of capacity to meet specific demand thresholds. Nothing prevents platforms from using this information to develop rival products and services and compete directly with the small businesses that use the platform. Indeed, there are persistent accusations that platforms such as Amazon engage in precisely this kind of behavior./23</p><p>\"Even without using information gleaned from the commercial relationship between the small business and the platform, dominant platforms can use their market power to require that small businesses provide them with terms as favorable as (or better than) those given to any rival platform. These \"most favored nation\" (MFN) policies prevent small businesses from taking advantage of efforts by potential competitors to compete against the dominant platform. The policies force small businesses to maintain higher prices even if the would-be competing platform offers superior terms in other respects. The ability of large platforms to conduct massive internet searches across multiple potential sales platforms gives the dominant platform an overwhelming advantage against any small business attempting to take advantage of competition between digital platforms.</p><p>\"Public Knowledge therefore proposes measures that have demonstrated effectiveness in the communications market. First, Public Knowledge proposes limitations on the use of proprietary information collected by the platform as part of its business dealings with small businesses. This type of information is known in communications law as \"customer proprietary network information\" (CPNI)./24</p><p>\"CPNI recognizes that although the network must \"know\" certain types of highly proprietary information to function, the law can limit the ability of the rival network to use this information for purposes other than the contracted service./25</p><p>\"Second, Public Knowledge proposes prohibiting punitive MFN clauses, or other mechanisms that prevent small businesses from finding alternatives to the dominant platform. Allowing small businesses to move freely between platforms without fear of reprisals is critical to maintaining a competitive environment and limiting the ability of dominant platforms to abuse small businesses dependent on them. It also promotes the development of competition, since dominant platforms cannot use their market power to prevent small businesses from patronizing rivals and enhancing their likelihood of success.</p><p>\"Non-discrimination, transparency and 'black box testing.' A repeated concern by small businesses and consumers alike is that platforms may favor content for reasons having nothing to do with consumer preferences. Whether it is Google Search, or Amazon's search engine and recommendations, or any other ordering and presentation of information, the platform has tremendous opportunity to discriminate in a number of ways without the consumer knowing. The most obvious concern is favoring affiliated products or down-ranking rivals. But platforms may also take money to prioritize search without disclosing this fact.</p><p>\"At the same time, businesses have incentive to \"game the system\" and try to manipulate search results. In the United States, \"search engine optimization\" (SEO), essentially the business of trying to get to the top of Google's search page, is a multibillion dollar business./26</p><p>\"Bad actors have routinely used understanding of how YouTube and Facebook optimize their recommendation and news feed algorithms for \"engagement\" to promote content designed to radicalize or undermine democratic discourse. Creating a truly transparent system to verify non-discrimination is therefore highly inadvisable.</p><p>\"In that case, the best solution is \"black box testing.\"/27</p><p>\"Where a party has reason to believe that search and recommendation results are manipulated to discriminate in an inappropriate fashion, the party would file a complaint with the enforcing agency. The enforcing agency would then be given access to the code for testing purposes. The enforcing agency would then determine whether or not reasonable grounds exists to open an investigation. The complaining party would not get access to the code, thus avoiding the ability of parties to use the complaint process as a pretext to gain access to proprietary algorithms to reverse engineer them.</p><p>\"Product unbundling and structural separation. When the combination of products creates both a powerful incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct and the structure of the company makes it difficult to otherwise police anticompetitive conduct, it makes sense to consider product unbundling and structural separation. Historically, these two remedies represent a range from requiring separate accounting within an intact firm to wholly separating the company into affiliated firms with entirely separate governance (even if they remain commonly owned). Typically, structural separation is created under the supervision of a court or an agency to ensure that it successfully creates lines of division that reduce or eliminate the incentive to favor one's own product and make it possible to police non-discrimination easily.</p><p>\"For example, beginning in the 1970s and continuing until Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required that incumbent telephone networks (first the AT&amp;#38;T monopoly, then the \"Baby Bells\") only offer certain types of service through a separate affiliate. For example, AT&amp;#38;T offered an alarm service. To ensure that it competed on equal terms with rival alarm companies, AT&amp;#38;T was required to offer this alarm service through an entirely separate affiliate, with separate corporate headquarters and separate facilities and workforce. Because AT&amp;#38;T was required to tariff the cost of interconnection with its phone network,/28 the FCC could make sure that AT&amp;#38;T the phone company offered the same rate to every alarm company - including AT&amp;#38;T's own affiliate.</p><p>\"Product unbundling works somewhat differently from structural separation. With product unbundling, a seller has a suite of products it may wish to sell as a unit, but regulators require it \"unbundle\" and sell the components separately. For example, in the 1990s, the United States required that local telephone companies sell unbundled access to various elements of the local network at regulated wholesale prices to potential competitors. The theory was that this would allow competition to emerge as competitors initially gained access to customers by leasing unbundled elements from the local monopoly provider, which would provide them with revenue to build out independent networks where economically feasible.</p><p>\"To illustrate with examples in the digital platform space, requiring Amazon to separate its retail business \"Amazon Essentials\" from its online merchant platform and operate them as entirely separate companies (even while allowing them to remain commonly owned) would be an example of structural separation. Alternatively, requiring Amazon to separate various services it currently requires third party sellers to take as a bundle and allowing them to pick which ones they wish to use would be an example of unbundling.</p><p>\"Structural separation and unbundling can be a very effective means of introducing competition and providing a level playing field for small businesses. The difficulty of implementing these regimes, however, should not be underestimated. Both structural separation and unbundling require ongoing regulatory supervision to ensure that the platform follows the rules. While the need for pervasive monitoring and supervision can be reduced in a well-designed system, it cannot be wholly eliminated as the economic factors that drove the consolidation in the first place will, absent some countervailing force, drive the separated pieces to reconsolidate.</p><p>\"Break ups and the Starfish problem. Sometimes, the only way to restore competitive balance to the marketplace is by breaking up a company into separate components. A successful break up will identify and separate the \"natural monopoly\" component for specific regulation, while simultaneously separating out those lines of business that reinforce the existing monopoly or monopolies.</p><p>\"The AT&amp;#38;T break-up is generally acknowledged as the most successful break-up in the last 50 years. It illustrates both the potential rewards of dismantling a set of interconnected and reinforcing monopolies and the enormous investment required to do so. The final litigation that concluded in the settlement breaking up AT&amp;#38;T into a longdistance company, an equipment manufacturing company, an information/yellow pages publisher and regional bell operating companies (\"RBOCS,\" aka the \"Baby Bells\") took ten years and the combined efforts of the Department of Justice and the FCC. The FCC conducted multiple proceedings to ensure that the break-up did not disrupt the phone system, and preserved service in rural areas subsidized by AT&amp;#38;T's regulated monopoly rates. Even after the break-up in 1984, the FCC continued to regulate AT&amp;#38;T longdistance as a dominant carrier until 1995./29</p><p>\"Once the Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed legal barriers to the telecommunications monopoly reconstituting itself, the market proceeded on a steady march to concentration. While not a monopoly, the current communications market has been described as an \"oligopoly on steroids.\"/30</p><p>\"The same fundamental economic factors that created the AT&amp;#38;T monopoly once again drove the communications market to concentration - a process which continues unabated with the recent acquisition of Sprint by T-Mobile. Broadband, which was supposed to provide the competitive antidote, is divided in most markets between a higher-speed cable offering and a lower speed DSL offering from the legacy telephone company.</p><p>\"This reconstituted communications oligopoly 35 years after the break-up of the original \"Ma Bell,\" is an example of the \"starfish problem.\" Tear up a starfish and it simply regrows the missing limbs. While not all monopolies suffer from the starfish problem, this natural regeneration of concentration will occur in any market where the underlying economic structure of the market itself drives toward concentration.</p><p>\"For this reason, although vigorous antitrust investigation and enforcement against dominant platforms is necessary, even the largest platforms can not simply be broken into pieces as a means of solving existing competition problems. Before any break-up, Congress must carefully consider what regulatory framework will prevent the market from simply returning to its highly concentrated state.</p><p>The Importance of Due Process</p><p>\"Due process does not extend simply to government action./31</p><p>\"Small businesses depend on a wide body of law protecting their rights to notice in the physical world. If a small business rents a storefront or space in a shopping mall, a body of commercial real estate law protects the business from arbitrary changes by the landlord and protects the shopkeeper from certain abusive behaviors. A small business can contract for critical inputs such as electricity or telecommunications or water service, confident that these utilities are subject to special regulation because society recognizes their vital importance as an input to small businesses.</p><p>\"Again, the point is not to replicate commercial real estate law or public utility law in the digital space. To the contrary, as I have repeated throughout this testimony, mechanical rote application of traditional law to digital platforms is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>\"But the basic principle that both economic efficiency and fundamental fairness entitle small businesses to due process before losing access to essential services or experiencing dramatic changes in contract terms applies equally in cyberspace as in physical space.</p><p>\"Distinguishing between dominant firms and non-dominant firms gives a starting point for discussion. When the decision of a single company can impact the bottom line of tens of thousands of small businesses, basic notice and protection become more urgent than when the stakes are lower. In the same vein, the nature of the notice and protections due should depend on the level of potential impact.</p><p>\"For example, Amazon has such a complicated and arcane set of rules around its appeals process that an entire cottage industry has developed to help small businesses navigate through it./32</p><p>\"The problem extends outside of Amazon. Users routinely complain that they do not understand platform policies, nor do they feel well treated by their appeal process./33</p><p>\"And, as mentioned above, content creators and third party sellers often find themselves given short \"take it or leave it\" notice for major changes imposing significant cost. Finally, in the cut-throat world of online retail, small business competitors may \"hack\" the processes of platforms to sabotage their rivals./34</p><p>\"A recent high-profile case on YouTube involving creator Lindsay Ellis illustrates how the lack of an appeals process can have significant impact for small businesses.</p><p>\"Lindsay Ellis creates content for YouTube, and employs four people in her production studio./35</p><p>\"As part of a video essay critical of Disney's effort to obscure its problematic history on racism, Ellis included a 5 second clip from the original animated Dumbo containing offensive lyrics from \"the Song of the Roustabouts.\" UMG holds the copyright to the Song of the Roustabouts. When YouTube's Copyright ID system identified the 5-second clip as part of a song belonging to UMG, it did not conduct a fair use analysis. YouTube offered UMG the option to monetize Ellis' work by inserting advertising in Ellis' video. This not only unjustly allowed UMG to profit from Ellis' intellectual property (the use of the clip clearly falling into the category of fair use), but interfered with Ellis' sponsorship contract with Audible, which prohibits internal advertising in Ellis' video essays that it sponsors. When Ellis complained to YouTube, she was informed that YouTube provided no appeal process and that she would need to go to court to vindicate her fair use claim.</p><p>\"The point here is not that YouTube should not have a Content ID system. The point is that by failing to provide an appeal system, YouTube has privileged the complainant over the defendant and privileged large businesses that can afford expensive litigation over small businesses that cannot. Indeed, under applicable law, had UMG ordered YouTube to take down Ellis' video as infringing, Ellis would have been entitled to issue a counter-notice to YouTube to restore the video pending court review./36</p><p>\"But because YouTube has decided to give the complaining rights holder an option to monetize the alleged infringement rather than demand a takedown, Ellis' statutory due process right has been abrogated.</p><p>\"As this example illustrates, a decision that a platform believes will benefit small businesses (providing a copyright complainant with an option other than takedown) can actually prove harmful to small businesses without appropriate due process. As this example also illustrates, there is no clear solution. Ideally, competition would prevent any single platform from becoming dominant, so that unintended consequences on one platform would not have broad impact and best practices could emerge as a function of competition between platforms. Absent this, however, Congress must consider how to encourage or require platforms to develop processes that treat small businesses fairly.</p><p>Small Businesses, Social Media, and the Problem of Filter Bubbles</p><p>\"Small businesses rely on social media both directly and indirectly. Small businesses may themselves be content producers or offer businesses that rely directly on social media platforms. More commonly, small businesses use social media platforms to communicate with potential customers and to attract interest. A viral video or Tweet can drive business and increase search optimization. One of the contributing factors to the success of the Instant Pot was the organic growth of its Facebook community as a place to exchange recipes and generally encourage people to feel that owning an Instant Pot made them part of a community./37</p><p>\"But small businesses may find themselves stymied by the tendency of recommendation algorithms to recommend to people increasingly homogenous content.</p><p>\"Dubbed \"filter bubbles,\" this phenomena challenges the ability of new content providers to find an audience. As legal scholar Cass Sunstein has argued, traditional media have an \"architecture of serendipity.\"/38</p><p>\"Go to a movie theater and you will see marquis for all the movies playing at the theater, even if you might not normally look for movies of that particular genre. Flip through television channels and you may stumble across an unexpectedly interesting TV show. Peruse the shelves of a bookstore and you may discover books from authors you never knew existed.</p><p>\"Increasingly, this experience cannot happen on digital platforms - to the detriment of small businesses. Recommendations are typically based on a combination of personal information (what the individual has previously watched before) and aggregate information (\"people who liked this also liked that\"). As the algorithm becomes more familiar with the individual user, its recommendations focus on content more and more similar to what the user watched previously, or what similarly situated people watched previously. Unlike the physical world, where the possibility of discovering something new increases with the length of time spent searching, the possibility of discovering something genuinely different actually decreases the longer someone uses the service.</p><p>\"Addressing this \"filter bubble\" problem is complicated. Forcing users to look at content they do not want to see \"for their own good\" will create resentment. But the entire point of an \"architecture of serendipity\" is that the user actually would enjoy the content if they had the opportunity to discover it under circumstances that replicated browsing a bookstore or other situation where a person is searching for new content.</p><p>\"One approach I recommend is called the \"wobbly algorithm.\" Algorithms generate a probability curve of content the user is likely to find engaging. Generally, given the limited space available, the algorithm recommends only a few choices at the very peak of the curve. What if, on some random number of recommendations, the algorithm recommended items slightly lower down the curve on either side? These would still fall within a general range of interest for the user, but they would not move in the same inexorable straight line as always selecting from the peak of the curve. Over time, this \"wobbly algorithm\" would introduce a significantly wider variety of content, but still falling within the range of content likely to appeal to the specific user.</p><p>Special Concerns Relating to App Stores</p><p>\"Many application developers have a beneficial relationship with the platform they develop for. By making platforms more useful and versatile, they provide value to the platform owner itself, and to users. Platforms, in turn, provide them with a customer base, distribution, technical and payment services, and other things. In recent years, app stores have made it easier than ever for users to install software while being assured that it is secure, and security techniques like sandboxing and code-signing can protect user data and device integrity.</p><p>\"However, the relationship doesn't always go smoothly, especially when the interests of the platform owner and the app developer may not align--for example, when the app developer creates apps that compete with those produced by the platform itself.</p><p>\"At these times, the very techniques that are used to benefit users and developers in most cases can become tools used for anticompetitive purposes.</p><p>\"The conflict between platforms and application developers has several flashpoints. Platform owners may privilege their own apps by preinstalling them on devices, and making it impossible to change certain defaults. Platform developers control the app stores that developers need to access to reach users, and could simply deny access to the store for alleged violations of the rules. App store rules themselves may be anticompetitive--and first-party apps might not even have to follow them. Platforms create the APIs that developers need to interact with, and these APIs in part determine the capabilities of apps. The APIs that developers are permitted to interact with may not give third-party apps the same functionality as first-party apps, and using the \"private APIs\" that platform owners can make free use of may be enough to block an app from an app store. Even the content guidelines that platforms establish may be problematic, if they prevent users from accessing lawful or politically sensitive content that is otherwise lawful.</p><p>\"The solution to these problems, however, cannot be to sacrifice user convenience and security by giving up the benefits that app stores and secure platforms provide. Instead, major platforms should prioritize the interests of users, and do a better job of creating an equal playing field for third-party developers. For example, a platform's own app store should not be the only way to install software on a device. With the safeguards provided by security techniques like sandboxing, code-signing, and app notarization in place,/39 users should be able to \"sideload\" software from the web. Public APIs should allow third-party apps to be fully competitive with platform-provided apps.</p><p>\"Third-party apps that provide access to media like music, movies, and ebooks should not have to use platform-provided billing systems that make it impossible for developers to turn a profit. Additionally, while it is appropriate for the creators of major platforms to provide users with a functional \"out of the box\" experience by preloading certain basic apps like email and a web browser, users should be able to change their defaults, and other apps (e.g., a video streaming service) should have to compete on a level playing field in the app store.</p><p>\"While policies like this can go a long way toward promoting competition and user choice while protecting security, a recent concrete example may illustrate why a sectorspecific regulator is needed--to deal with specific factual scenarios it is unreasonable to expect Congress to have legislated about in advance, and where antitrust remedies may not be adequate.</p><p>\"In iOS 13, Apple limited the ability of third-party apps to gather location information in the background. While this may have some unintentional side effects on some categories of app, as a general matter this can be seen as an improvement to user privacy, and even a method to prolong an iPhone's battery life. However, Apple's own Maps app is not affected by this rule change--not because Apple has allowed the Maps app to collect location information in the background, but because location information for \"Routing &amp;#38; Traffic\" and \"Improve Maps\" is collected not by the Maps app but by the system itself. To opt out of this data collection, users have to go into the Settings app, chose \"Privacy,\" then \"Location Services,\" then \"System Services\" to locate the appropriate setting. By contrast, users have to use the Settings app to opt in to allow a third-party app to continually collect location data in the background--the app itself cannot offer that option at all. But the solution to this isn't to simply ask that Apple allow for indiscriminate data collection by apps--it is to require that Apple follow the same rules for data collection that it imposes on third parties, or to require that it makes the (non-personally identifiable) data that it collects available to third-party apps so that they can make the same use of it that Apple itself does.</p><p>\"This example shows that, with digital platforms, issues of privacy, security, competition, and even user experience can all arise together from a single decision. Deciding in advance as a matter of policy to optimize for one at the expense of the others would lead to a bad outcome. Thus, a unified approach is needed, and a single digital platform regulator would be best-suited to provide it.</p><p>The Role of Antitrust</p><p>\"Traditionally, small businesses have benefited from pro-competition laws and rules, as well as strong antitrust enforcement, that kept consolidated power in check. This allowed small businesses greater room to thrive and provided them with a variety of options to choose from for their necessary inputs and paths to market. Over the last forty years, a de-regulatory spirit swept away many of these pro-competition policies, and the antitrust laws have been increasingly narrowed by judicial precedents based on economics that is now called into question./40</p><p>\"Antitrust law needs targeted improvements in order to fulfill this important role again.</p><p>\"At the same time, America's antitrust agencies need to increase enforcement of our antitrust laws. The FTC, DOJ, and state attorneys general are investigating the dominant platforms for potential antitrust violations. This is a positive step. It's imperative that our antitrust enforcers scrutinize these companies to discover whether they have committed violations of the antitrust laws and stop and remedy any violations that have occurred. It's important that the FTC, DOJ, and State Attorneys General devote the appropriate resources to make these investigations successful.</p><p>\"But digital platforms are a special case. Economists have identified digital platform markets as being particularly prone to tipping, with or without antitrust violations./41</p><p>\"As a result, antitrust will only go so far towards building competition in an industry where there is currently very little competition. Antitrust enforcement must wait until anticompetitive conduct occurs, and remedies are limited to correcting the impacts of that anticompetitive conduct. Antitrust enforcers rarely get the opportunity to restructure industries in the big and continuing ways that are needed. A comprehensive regulatory plan is required to fully address the problems of competition in digital platforms.</p><p>\"Thank you and I am prepared to answer any questions at this time.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1.

A tariff is a regulated rate determined by a regulator (through a public rate-setting proceeding), based on the cost of providing the regulated service and a reasonable rate of return. It is a public document, and any similarly situated party is entitled to the same regulated rate. The rate regulator, such as the FCC, also has the power to hear and investigate complaints that the provider is engaging in price or service discrimination. Here, AT&amp;#38;T was required to offer all companies that wanted to interconnect with its network to provide alarm service the same government approved price, subject to investigation and enforcement by the government if it tried to favor its own affiliate.</p><p>29.

Sandboxing limits the amount of access that apps have to user data, data created by other apps, and system resources, sometimes allowing such access only in response to specific user actions. Code-signing is a cryptographic feature that ensures that an app comes from a specific developer, and prevents code from running if it has been modified after having been signed. Notarization is similar to code-signing, but involves the platform owner signing an app after checking it for malware and other issues. Both codesigning and app notarization allow an app to be remotely prevented from running if it is discovered to be malicious. Apps distributed through app stores are typically signed. Platforms can decide whether to require that apps be signed in some way, or can encourage if not require that apps be signed through certain user interface design choices.</p><p>40. Jonathan B.

Investigating Big Tech's Impact on Small Business\":</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"My name is Molson Hart. Almost 10 years ago I founded a toy company named Viahart. We have 4 full time employees and we sold about $4 million dollars of product on Amazon last year and should sell about $5 million dollars on Amazon this year. I speak Chinese, I know manufacturing, logistics, and e-commerce.</p><p>\"And with regards to Big Tech, Amazon is my area of expertise. With my testimony, I am going to give you a bird's eye view of what it's like to operate as a small business in Amazon's orbit as well as answer the questions posed by the hearing summary. I will also submit detailed documents for the record that describe issues small businesses and consumers face on Amazon, what government can do about it, and whether they should.</p><p>\"To the question \"Has Amazon created business solutions that have enabled small businesses to reach and serve new customers?\" - The answer to that question is \"Yes, absolutely.\" Their Fulfillment by Amazon program solved logistical issues for small businesses that previously would've required big investments or big headaches. This has enabled small businesses to offer less expensive and innovative products more easily to American consumers. Everyone, perhaps with the exception of brick-and-mortar retailers, has won: Amazon, small businesses, and consumers.</p><p>\"As a result, Amazon owns e-commerce. We can talk statistics, but just trust me; for most categories, such as books, toys, electronics, home goods, and gifts etc., basically everything but cars, food, gasoline, luxury, and convenience, Amazon is dominant. In 2018, despite selling on eBay, Walmart.com, our own website, and brick and mortar stores, Amazon accounted for 98% of our revenue. So, \"Do small businesses like ours rely on Amazon?\" Yes, completely.</p><p>\"When they say \"jump\", we say \"how high\" - if Amazon suspends us from the platform, we go bust, and we go bust fast. In 2018, we paid $2 million dollars to Amazon and Amazon's expenses as a share of our revenue on Amazon have gone from 33% in 2013 to 50% in 2018. That said, we've been profitable and our sales have grown 37% every year over that period. So \"Do small businesses have an opportunity to compete in the information age?\" It is not easy and we work very hard, but we, as a small business, have done all right. So, yes, we do have an opportunity to compete amongst \"Big Tech\"...but, is the playing field fair? The answer to that is like a Facebook relationship status - \"it's complicated\".</p><p>\"If we compete against Amazon, we operate at a massive disadvantage, but provided they don't engage in underhanded tactics, that's okay. It's capitalist competition. If Amazon Basics knocks off one of our products, provided they didn't commit IP 1/2 2019/11/12 infringement, it's unfortunate, but it's okay. On balance, while they certainly make their fair share of mistakes, which I describe in my additional submission for the record, and while they sometimes focus on what's legal rather than what's ethical, they are a good company. They're also an engine for innovation. As such, we, as a nation, should take great care in legislating or regulating this giant , but also fast moving and innovative company. Like in the hippocratic oath, we should \"first, do no harm\". In keeping the metaphor, it is said that sunshine is the best disinfectant.</p><p>\"By shining light on the issues, we can compel Amazon to do a better job in addressing them. Since selling on the platform, I have seen them make great strides towards improving their marketplace for honest sellers and consumers. While I do think there are some areas where legislation and regulation is appropriate, in general, here, the threat of it is stronger than its execution.</p><p>\"We can do better for American consumers, American small businesses, and the entire United States by proceeding with caution and introducing narrow legislation that addresses the nagging problems on the platform. My additional submission for the record not only describes these problems in detail, but also suggests legislative solutions that can win bipartisan support and better America for all stakeholders.</p><p>\"So let's do it. And let's do it now.</p><p>\"We have a unique opportunity in time to improve our country by doing so and I look forward to working with you to make it happen.</p><p>\"Thank you for this opportunity and I welcome your questions.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6929909 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6929909</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHY-T1H1-JC11-12BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"767\"/><timeReceived>3:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Scott Applewhite AP</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Members of both parties on Tuesday suggested legislation may be necessary for the financially struggling U.S. news industry as lawmakers began a bipartisan investigation into the market dominance of Silicon Valley companies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, news media associations accused the tech companies of jeopardizing the industry's economic survival by putting news content on their platforms without fairly compensating them. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is the first significant antitrust investigation undertaken by Congress in decades,\" Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee's chairman, said at the start of the hearing. The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws \"are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.\" </p><p>Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created \"an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.\" At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online \"have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.\" </p><p>As a partial solution, Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. He called it \"a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health\" of the news business. </p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously. </p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the Internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,\" Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\" </p><p>But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance representing some 2,000 news organizations of all sizes and types, called an antitrust exemption \"the lightest-touch option on the table.\" </p><p>\"There's a real urgency in the industry. We're at crisis point now,\" Chavern said. </p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\" </p><p>\"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. </p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment - with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies. </p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust chief suggested in a speech Tuesday that he may take a broad view of harm to competition, and take into account quality factors such as the threat to privacy, not only whether a company's dominant market position results in higher prices. </p><p>\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said, according to a transcript of his speech in Tel Aviv, Israel, provided by the department. </p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data. </p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,\" but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House. </p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies. </p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC. </p><p>\"We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\" </p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations. </p><p>Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up \"a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back, \"Walmart is much larger.\" </p><p>And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it \"will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\" </p><p>Gordon writes for </p><p>The Associated Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0096294209</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB0-YC21-JBM5-R31H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00031BS</classCode><className>COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This isn't about Democrats or Republicans. It's about saving our democracy. If it is what we need to do to honor our responsibility to the Constitution - if that's the place the facts take us, that's the place we have to go ...

The former White House counsel could give a firsthand account of how Donald Trump allegedly broke the law in an effort to keep the Mueller investigation at bay.</p><p>If McGahn testifies in an open hearing about what Trump told him to do - namely, pressure deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to fire Robert Mueller, then publicly deny any such order had ever been given - that could make Trump look bad in a new way. </p><p>The request for documents in the subpoena is broad, and McGahn could be asked to testify about numerous other matters. That's if it goes as well as it could for Democrats and others concerned about the special counsel's findings. </p><p>On the other hand, McGahn could resist the subpoena. But he did sit for at least three voluntary interviews with Mueller's team totaling 30 hours. His pattern of conduct to this point has been compliance.</p><p>There's a scene in the Mueller report from a Saturday in June 2017. Trump is at Camp David and McGahn is at home in Virginia. The lawyer gets two calls from the president, which he later described to Mueller, whose report reads: </p><p>'You gotta do this',\" McGahn recalls the president saying. \"'You gotta call Rod.'\"</p><p>But McGahn did not call Rod.</p><p>McGahn considered the president's request to be an inflection point and he wanted to hit the brakes. </p><p>Democratic members of the judiciary committee might want to hear more about that phone call and other interactions McGahn had with the president.</p><p>block-time published-time 10.47pm BST </p><p>This is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco picking up the live blog reins, by the way. </p><p>And here are some more details on the subpoena just issued to former White House counsel Don McGahn: </p><p>The subpoena names 36 categories of documents and communications that must be turned over, with topics including \"The resignation or termination of Michael Flynn\" (item No 4) and \"Your resignation or termination, whether contemplated or actual\" (item No 14). </p><p>Other items in the subpoena appear aimed at understanding what efforts to fight back against the Mueller investigation that may have been contemplated inside the White House, such as: </p><p>10. Reversing or attempting to reverse Jeff Session's recusal from any matters...</p><p>28. Prosecuting or investigating James Comey or Hillary Clinton. </p><p>29. Presidential pardons, whether possible or actual, for Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, Roger Stone, individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, or individuals involved in matters before the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. </p><p>The full subpoena can be viewed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/apr/22/trump-news-today-latest-live-mueller-2020-updates-democrats-impeachment?page=with:block-5cbe2f9a8f085bb0e0de6592#block-5cbe2f9a8f085bb0e0de6592\">here</url>. </p><p>block-time published-time 10.24pm BST </p><p> House Judiciary committee subpoenas former White House counsel  </p><p>Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary committee, has issued a subpoena to former White House counsel Don McGahn for testimony and documents related to its investigation into potential obstruction of justice by Donald Trump.</p><p>\"The Special Counsel's report, even in redacted form, outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses,\" Nadler said in a statement. \"It now falls to Congress to determine for itself the full scope of the misconduct and to decide what steps to take in the exercise of our duties of oversight, legislation and constitutional accountability.\"</p><p>The committee is requesting McGahn turn over documents by 7 May and testify in public on 21 May. </p><p>\"His testimony will help shed further light on the President's attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others do the same,\" the statement continues. \"The Special Counsel and his team made clear that based on their investigation, they were unable to 'reach [the] judgment....that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice.'

Here's a rundown of the top stories in politics: The House judiciary committee subpoenaed former White House counsel Don McGahn Donald Trump sued House Oversight committee chair Elijah Cummings in a bid to block a subpoena of his financial records. Elizabeth Warren unveiled her proposal for free college and canceling student debt Massachusetts Representative Seth Moulton launched a presidential campaign Herman Cain dropped out of the running for a seat on the Federal Reserve Have a good evening! A few more details on the Democratic caucus conference call, via Lauren Gambino. According to a source on the call, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made the following comments during the nearly 90 minute discussion: We have to save our democracy. This isn't about Democrats or Republicans. It's about saving our democracy. If it is what we need to do to honor our responsibility to the Constitution - if that's the place the facts take us, that's the place we have to go ... And I wish you would just read my letter because it, I think succinctly, presents some of the reasons I think - whether it's articles of impeachment or investigations, it's the same obtaining of facts. We don't have to go to articles of impeachment to obtain the facts, the presentation of facts. President Trump has signed a presidential memorandum directing the Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security to combat visa overstays. The administration is considering suspending or limiting entry for individuals coming from countries with high rates of people overstaying visas, according to a press release from the White House. The most recent report by the Center for Migration Studies, covering 2016-2017, found that overstaying a visa accounted for about 62% of newly undocumented people, compared to just 38% who \"entered without inspection\" - ie crossed the border without authorization. Here's my colleague Lauren Gambino reporting on an internal conference call among House Democrats: Polls are beginning to come out, providing some insight into how the release of the redacted Mueller report is being viewed by the general public. Trump's approval rating dropped to 39% - the lowest of his presidency - in a new Politico/Morning Consult poll. The last time Trump's rating was that low in the same poll was in the aftermath of the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. Another poll, by HuffPost/YouGov, which was conducted immediately after the release of the redacted report, found that 43% of Americans believe that Trump attempted to obstruct the special counsel's investigation, compared to 34% who believe he did not. USA Today's Brad Heath pulled out an interesting tidbit from the details of that poll: nearly half of Republicans agree with the statement, \"Nobody on President Trump's campaign committed any crimes\", despite the fact that many people on Trump's campaign have pleaded guilty to committing crimes. These include: former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former personal attorney Michael Cohen, and campaign advisers Rick Gates, Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulous. Here's my colleague Tom McCarthy on what the McGahn subpoena could portend: The subpoena of Don McGahn by the House Judiciary Committee could have the effect of bringing the Mueller report to life, in the sense that multiple key scenes from the report star McGahn. The former White House counsel could give a firsthand account of how Donald Trump allegedly broke the law in an effort to keep the Mueller investigation at bay. If McGahn testifies in an open hearing about what Trump told him to do - namely, pressure deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to fire Robert Mueller, then publicly deny any such order had ever been given - that could make Trump look bad in a new way. The request for documents in the subpoena is broad, and McGahn could be asked to testify about numerous other matters. That's if it goes as well as it could for Democrats and others concerned about the special counsel's findings. On the other hand, McGahn could resist the subpoena. But he did sit for at least three voluntary interviews with Mueller's team totaling 30 hours. His pattern of conduct to this point has been compliance. There's a scene in the Mueller report from a Saturday in June 2017. Trump is at Camp David and McGahn is at home in Virginia. The lawyer gets two calls from the president, which he later described to Mueller, whose report reads: 'You gotta do this',\" McGahn recalls the president saying. \"'You gotta call Rod.'\" But McGahn did not call Rod. McGahn considered the president's request to be an inflection point and he wanted to hit the brakes. Democratic members of the judiciary committee might want to hear more about that phone call and other interactions McGahn had with the president. This is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco picking up the live blog reins, by the way. And here are some more details on the subpoena just issued to former White House counsel Don McGahn: The subpoena names 36 categories of documents and communications that must be turned over, with topics including \"The resignation or termination of Michael Flynn\" (item No 4) and \"Your resignation or termination, whether contemplated or actual\" (item No 14). Other items in the subpoena appear aimed at understanding what efforts to fight back against the Mueller investigation that may have been contemplated inside the White House, such as: 10. Reversing or attempting to reverse Jeff Session's recusal from any matters... 28. Prosecuting or investigating James Comey or Hillary Clinton. 29. Presidential pardons, whether possible or actual, for Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, Roger Stone, individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, or individuals involved in matters before the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. The full subpoena can be viewed here. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary committee, has issued a subpoena to former White House counsel Don McGahn for testimony and documents related to its investigation into potential obstruction of justice by Donald Trump. \"The Special Counsel's report, even in redacted form, outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses,\" Nadler said in a statement. \"It now falls to Congress to determine for itself the full scope of the misconduct and to decide what steps to take in the exercise of our duties of oversight, legislation and constitutional accountability.\" The committee is requesting McGahn turn over documents by 7 May and testify in public on 21 May. \"His testimony will help shed further light on the President's attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others do the same,\" the statement continues. \"The Special Counsel and his team made clear that based on their investigation, they were unable to 'reach [the] judgment....that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice.' As a co-equal branch of government, Congress has a constitutional obligation to hold the President accountable, and the planned hearings will be an important part of that process.\" The subpoenas can be seen here. Democrats grappled with their next steps after the release of the Mueller report, acknowledging divisions over whether to pursue the impeachment of Donald Trump. In a letter to colleagues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi advised caution on impeachment, but vowed that Democrats would continue to hold hearings and \"uncover the truth.\" Democrats have a conference call scheduled for 5pm. Donald Trump sued to block a subpoena for his financial records, issued by the House Oversight Committee to his accounting firm. Committee chairman Elijah Cummings called the suit baseless. Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton launched his presidential bid. Donald Trump reversed course and said he would not appoint Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve board, saying Cain had asked to bow out. Herman Cain explains his reasons for withdrawing from consideration for the Federal Reserve. For one thing, he said it would have been a big pay cut. \"I also started wondering if I'd be giving up too much influence to get a little bit of policy impact,\" Cain wrote. \"With my current media activities, I can reach close to 4 million people a month with the ideas I believe in. If I gave that up for one seat on the Fed board, would that be a good trade-off?\" The US is threatening to veto a United Nations resolution on combatting the use of rape as a weapon of war, the Guardian's Julian Borger reports. The US is objecting to language that says survivors of sexual violence should have access to comprehensive health services, including sexual and reproductive health. It's part of a hard line taken by the Trump administration in recent months, refusing to agree to any UN documents that refer to sexual or reproductive health, on grounds that such language implies support for abortions. Democratic presidential candidate Wayne Messam said Monday he supports impeaching Donald Trump, becoming the third Democratic primary contender to do so. \"I believe the President should be placed under impeachment proceedings and let the weight of the full report carry out the justice the American people deserve,\" Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Fl., told the Hill. Senator Elizabeth Warren and former housing secretary Julian Castro have called for Trump's impeachment. Washington Gov. and presidential hopeful Jay Inslee is asking other candidates in the field to support a primary debate focused entirely on climate change. Inslee has made climate change his signature issue. He posted a letter to fellow Democratic contenders Monday urging them to tell the Democratic National Committee to dedicate a debate to the issue. \"We need a full debate on climate change. Climate change is at the heart of every issue that matters to voters, and voters deserve to hear what 2020 presidential candidates plan to do about it,\" Inslee wrote. Donald Trump claims that \"the people who were closest to me\" were not called to testify to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigators. He doesn't name names, but the Mueller report did rely on dozens of hours of witness accounts from Trump's advisers. They include former White House counsel Don McGahn, former chief of staff Reince Priebus, and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. CNN will host a marathon of presidential town halls tonight, featuring Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Pete Buttigieg. Actress Susan Sarandon made a donation to former Senator Mike Gravel, one of the lesser known names in the Democratic presidential race. \"The more Dem voices in the primary, the better!\" she said in a tweet. Donald Trump has been tweeting Fox News clips all day. By our count this is number 5. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed Monday to be the \"grim reaper\" for progressive policies. \"If I'm still the majority leader in the Senate think of me as the Grim Reaper. None of that stuff is going to pass,\" the Republican said at an event in his home state of Kentucky, the Hill reported. McConnell promised to stand in the way of policies like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All even if Democrats defeat Donald Trump and retain control of the House. \"I guarantee you that if I'm the last man standing and I'm still the majority leader, it ain't happening. I can promise you,\" he said. Former Vice President Joe Biden is planning a trip to Iowa next week, according to CNN. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is proposing $550 fees to own and carry a gun. It now only costs $27 for a a firearm identification card, a permit to own a gun, and a permit to carry, the New York Times reports, unchanged since the 1960s. Under Murphy's proposal, an ID card would cost $100, a permit to own a gun would be $50, and a permit to carry would be $400. \"There's no war on responsible gun owners,\" he told the Times. \"We can support the efforts of the attorney general, state troopers, county and local law enforcement, to do the stuff we need to do: track crime, track gun violence, combat trafficking of illegal guns.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden plans to shutter his charitable foundation when he enters the 2020 presidenital race, the New York Times reports. By winding down the Biden Foundation, he may be hoping to avoid some of the conflict of interest questions that dogged Hillary Clinton about her family foundation during the 2016 election. The Biden Foundation would likely suspend its activities immediately and then begin a longer process of gradually dismantling itself, according to the Times. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Democratic House members ahead of their conference call on responding to the Mueller report, per PBS. \"While our views range from proceeding to investigate the findings or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth. It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the President accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings,\" she wrote. She added: \"Whether currently indictable or not, it is clear that the President has, at a minimum, engaged in highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior which does not bring honor to the office he holds.\" The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee said he has reviewed a version of the Mueller report with fewer redactions, the Hill reports. Democrats have demanded the full, unredacted report and declined an offer to a select group of lawmakers to view a less-redacted version than the one that was made public. \"Today I had the opportunity to view the Mueller report at the Department of Justice,\" Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the panel, said Monday. \"I encourage Chairman Nadler and Democrat leaders to view this material as soon as possible - unless they're afraid to acknowledge the facts this report outlines.\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed legislation banning plastic bags in the state. \"You see plastic bags hanging in trees, blowing down the streets, in landfills and in our waterways, and there is no doubt they are doing tremendous damage,\" Cuomo said. The ban was passed by the state legislature as part of the state budget. Cities and towns will have an option to impose a five cent fee for paper bags, which New York City voted to do last week. A new poll shows Pete Buttigieg in third place among Democratic voters in New Hampshire, after Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Philip Klein argues in an op-ed in the Washington Examiner that Elizabeth Warren's plan to cancel student debt is a slap in the face to people who have worked hard to pay off their loans. \"The plan would be tremendously unfair to those who have been struggling for years to pay off their student loans,\" he wrote. \"There are those who have cut expenses to the bare bones to pay off loans while watching their friends with similar salaries eat out and travel and de-prioritize paying off loans. Those who were more responsible will feel justifiably enraged at the idea that those who may have been more profligate will now get a bailout from the government.\" The argument has drawn some mockery on Twitter. A few of the people who did in fact disobey Donald Trump's orders, according to the Mueller report: House Oversight Committee chairman Elijah Cummings called a lawsuit against him by Donald Trump \"baseless.\" Trump sued Monday to block the committee's subpoena to an accounting firm for the president's financial records. \"There is simply no valid legal basis to interfere with this duly authorized subpoena from Congress,\" Cummings said Monday, according to Reuters. \"This complaint reads more like political talking points than a reasoned legal brief, and it contains a litany of inaccurate information.\" \"The White House is engaged in unprecedented stonewalling on all fronts, and they have refused to produce a single document or witness to the Oversight Committee during this entire year,\" he added. Donald Trump won't name Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve board after all, saying that Cain asked him to nix the nomination. A number of Republican senators had said they would not support Cain, making it unlikely he would have the necessary support to be confirmed. Cain's 2012 presidential campaign collapsed amid allegations of sexual harassment. A new Environmental Justice Caucus is being formed in the Senate, Yahoo News reports. Democratic senators Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Tom Carper of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey will chair the new group. \"Oftentimes, black and brown communities are the ones that suffer the biggest consequences of pollution and a lack of enforcement on environmental issues,\" Duckworth told Yahoo. Donald Trump's Federal Reserve pick Stephen Moore has written that women should be barred from from refereeing, announcing even selling beer at at men's college basketball games, CNN reports. He made the points in four different columns, asking if there was any area in life \"where men can take vacation from women,\" and calling it a \"travesty\" that men and women play sports together in recreational leagues. During an Easter Egg roll at the White House, Donald Trump looked up from coloring cards with a group of kids and said that one of the children there told him to build the wall. \"I will. Oh, it's happening. It's being built now,\" Trump said, according to a pool report. \"Here's a young guy who said, 'Keep building that wall.' Can you believe that? He's going to be a conservative some day!\" The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up the questions of whether it's illegal for employers to discriminate against LGBT workers. The court agreed to hear three cases on the issue, BuzzFeed reports. At issue is whether the 1964 Civil Rights Act's ban on discrimination on the basis of sex - in addition to race, religion, and national origin - applies to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In a New York case, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a skydiving instructor who said he was fired because he was gay. But a court in Georgia reached the opposite conclusion, ruling against a child welfare services coordinator who said he was fired for being gay because they found the civil rights act does not apply to sexual orientation. Donald Trump told reporters he is not worried about impeachment - \"not even a little bit,\" CNN reports. Asked about findings in special counsel Robert Mueller's report that staffers had often failed to carry out his orders to undermine the investigations against him, Trump said, \"Nobody disobeys my orders.\" After releasing a new plan to cancel student debt and make public colleges tuition free, Senator Elizabeth Warren was asked on CNN today if she can win by being the policy candidate. Her response: Donald Trump called Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this morning to express condolences to the people of Sri Lanka for the Easter day terrorist attacks that killed nearly 300 people, according to the White House. Trump \"pledged United States support to Sri Lanka in bringing the perpetrators to justice.\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders went after reporter April Ryan after Ryan said she should be fired for lying to the public and press. \"When there is a lack of credibility there, you have to start, and start lopping the heads off,\" Ryan said Friday on CNN. \"It's Fire-Me Thursday or Fire-Me Good Friday. She needs to go.\" On Fox News this morning, Sanders acted as if Ryan's call for heads to roll was literally advocating for decapitation. \"I've had a lot of reporters say a lot of things about me. They've said I should be choked. They said I should deserve a lifetime of harassment. But I've certainly never had somebody say I should be decapitated. This takes us to a new low even for the liberal media,\" she said. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe Monday to tout his city's plan to combat climate change, but faced grilling about his daily 11 mile SUV trips to his Brooklyn gym. \"This is just part of my life. I come from that neighborhood in Brooklyn,\" de Blasio said, adding that his security detail would follow him in their cars even if he took the subway. \"I go there on a regular basis to stay connected to where I come from and not be in the bubble that I think for a lot of politicians is a huge problem.\" De Blasio is typically driven from the upper East Side, where he lives in Gracie Mansion, to a YMCA in Park Slope, Brooklyn each morning. While he has said the ritual is to help him stay connected, he has not always been willing to engage with citizens who try to talk to him about issues there. The New York mayor is considering a run for president. The climate plan passed by the City Council last week will require large building to cut their emissions by 40% by 2030. Asked if he would be \"lucky 21\" - the 21st Democrat to jump into the presidential field - de Blasio said, \"I'm going to make a decision soon.\" \"Donald Trump actually can win and Democrats have to be strong and clear and bold and progressive in our messages or we're not going to make it,\" he said. As he announces his presidential campaign, Rep. Seth Moulton has withdrawn his candidacy for re-election to Congress, ProPublica reports. He still could re-file at a later date, however. Donald Trump tells Democrats not to impeach him. And tweets another Fox News clip. A federal appeals court rejected a petition from Chelsea Manning to be released from jail after she was held in contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury. \"The court finds no error in the district court's rulings and affirms its finding of civil contempt,\" the appeals court wrote in its ruling Monday, Politico reports. Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst who turned over a massive trove of documents to Wikileaks, was ordered jailed after refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating the website. Senator Amy Klobuchar announced five new staffers Monday for her presidential campaign, Politico reports. She also named five senior advisers from outside consulting firms. The staff hires are Tim Hogan, communications director; Lucinda Ware, national political director; Anjan Mukherjee, research director; and Mike McLaughlin, national field director. Donald Trump and his company sued House Oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings Monday in a bid to block a congressional subpoena of his financial records, the Washington Post reports. The suit asks a court to block Trump's accounting firm, Mazars, from complying with a subpoena it was issued last week. The subpoena asks for years of Trump's financial statements. \"Democrats are singularly obsessed with finding something they can use to damage the President politically,\" the filing by Trump says, according to the Post. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has contributed another $5.5 million to the United Nations' climate change program, to pay off what would have been the US contribution under the Paris agreement before the Trump administration withdrew. Bloomberg promised in 2017 to personally fill the funding gap, and last year paid $4.5 million. Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg's campaign infrastructure is no match for his recent surge in popularity, the Associated Press reports. The South Bend, Indiana mayor told the AP his supporters have mostly had to \"organize themselves\" so far. \"We need to make sure we have the organizational strengths to sustain this wave of support that we've been getting for the last almost month and a half now,\" he said. \"It's created some challenges to rise this far this fast, but I would put those in the category of a good problem to have.\" Buttigieg's campaign had about a dozen paid staffers at the end of last month, according to campaign finance filings, but is now over 30 and expects to hit 50 by the end of the month. His campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl, is a high school friend with no experience in presidential politics. The Trump administration will not renew waivers that allowed eight foreign governments to buy oil from Iran without facing sanctions. \"This decision is intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the regime its principal source of revenue,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Monday. The waivers expire in May. Oil prices have already soared after news emerged that the move was coming. Donald Trump tweets a clip of a Fox News host arguing that Democrats will \"never stop\" focusing on Russian election interference because \"they do not care about you or your life.\" \"So true,\" Trump wrote. Iowa state Rep. Jennifer Konfrst endorsed Senator Cory Booker for president. Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed a $1.25 trillion plan to wipe out most student loan debt and make all public colleges tuition-free. The plan would cancel debt, most of which is held by the federal government, up to $50,000 for people with household incomes under $100,000, and partially cancel debt for people who make up to $250,000. The Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate would provide federal money to eliminate the cost of tuition and fees at every public two-year and four-year college in the country. The proposal would be paid for by the new tax Warren has proposed for wealthy families. It's the latest ambitious policy proposal from Warren, who has also released detailed plans on childcare and housing and to break up big tech companies. Warren also proposes a ban on federal money going to for-profit colleges. \"We got into this crisis because state governments and the federal government decided that instead of treating higher education like our public school system - free and accessible to all Americans - they'd rather cut taxes for billionaires and giant corporations and offload the cost of higher education onto students and their families. The student debt crisis is the direct result of this failed experiment,\" she wrote in a post on Medium. \"It's time to end that experiment, to clean up the mess it's caused, and to do better.\" An Earth Day message from Donald Trump gets in several references to the economy, jobs and natural resources but none to climate change. \"Environmental protection and economic prosperity go hand in hand. A strong market economy is essential to protecting our critical natural resources and fostering a legacy of conservation,\" wrote Trump, whose administration has rolled back a host of environmental regulations. Democrats pondering next steps after special counsel Robert Mueller's report have scheduled a conference call for 5pm today to game out their options. They'll discuss whether to initiate impeachment proceedings, a step opposed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi but which some other Democrats have pushed for. House Intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff said Sunday the Democratic caucus will meet in the next few weeks to discuss whether to pursue impeachment. \"We're going to have a caucus about this over the next couple weeks to try to figure out what the best course is, not for the party, but what's the best course for the country,\" he said on Fox News Sunday. We have another entrant to the crowded Democratic primary race this morning: Massachusetts representative Seth Moulton announced he is running for president. \"Decades of division and corruption have broken our democracy and robbed Americans of their voice. It's all led to an administration that's turned away from our values,\" Moulton said in an announcement video. \"The greatest generation saved our country from tyranny. It's time for our generation to step up and do the same.\" Moulton is a decorated Marine veteran who served in Iraq and was elected to Congress in 2014. He led efforts to recruit other veterans to run for Congress, and was the face of an unsuccessful push to block Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker when the Democrats took over the House. He becomes the 19th Democrat to officially declare his candidacy. 28145 false false      Don McGahn has been asked to turn over documents by 7 May and testify in public on 21 May.     </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52944057</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VY9-3C81-F021-60W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11004\"/><timeReceived>1:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

A day after a similarly critical Senate hearing, it was the House Financial Services Committee's turn. David Marcus, a Facebook executive, faced over four hours of questions about Facebook's plans for a cryptocurrency called Libra. As was the case Tuesday, Marcus was dogged by his company's controversial reputation as well as skepticism of the legal uses of cryptocurrencies. </p><p>\"This is the biggest thing this committee will deal with this decade,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif. \"This is a godsend to drug dealers and tax evaders.\" When Facebook announced Libra in June, it said it wanted to create a new global financial system. The initiative, if successful, could put digital wallets in the hands of the more than 2 billion people who use Messenger and WhatsApp, the messaging platforms owned by Facebook. The antagonism toward Facebook's Libra effort is part of a broader escalation of criticism of tech giants in Washington, which was on full display in a series of hearings Tuesday. Even before Facebook announced its intentions to move into the financial system, the company had battled concerns that it had grown too powerful. \"I think before you move on to Libra, you ought to clean up the messes of the past,\" Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., said at the hearing. Libra also faces doubts from regulators around the world. On Wednesday, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Gita Gopinath, told reporters she was concerned that Libra could unfairly increase the influence of the dollar in the global economy while also making money laundering easier, Reuters reported. While the Senate hearing about Libra on Tuesday focused on the widespread mistrust of Facebook, House committee members showed more interest in the many practical hurdles that are likely to confront Facebook if it wants to release Libra next year, as it has said it wants to do. \"Facebook's plans raise serious privacy, trading and monetary policy concerns,\" said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the committee. The system will \"yield immense economic power that could destabilize government.\" Waters said she was working on new legislation that would make it illegal for big tech companies to get involved in the financial industry, which could stop Libra in its tracks. Marcus, the executive overseeing Calibra, the Facebook subsidiary working on the project, struck a conciliatory tone for a second day and said Facebook was listening to its critics. \"I believe we are owning these mistakes and working to remedy them,\" he said. Republicans on the committee were more eager to talk about the benefits that might come from Libra, but they also expressed their concern about Facebook's plan. \"Quite frankly, I don't care for Facebook,\" said Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga. \"But I do appreciate anyone who challenges the status quo.\" Several Republicans asked if Facebook could stop people from using Libra in the way that it has closed the accounts of controversial political figures like conservative commentator Milo Yiannopoulos. \"I don't know,\" Marcus said, emphasizing the basic uncertainties that still face the currency. Facebook has designed Libra so it can be governed by dozens of big corporate partners, organized through a Swiss nonprofit. This is supposed to reduce Facebook's power over the currency, but it led to questions Wednesday about how much power U.S. regulators would have if governance of the system was not taking place in the United States.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN69041645</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKV-WDM1-DYRV-41FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

But the representatives succeeded in wringing some surprising admissions from the executives about how they wield their market power, providing ammunition for regulators now conducting investigations \u2014 and possibly a spur for Congress to strengthen antitrust law for the digital era.The big picture: Here's where the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee pressed each company hardest. Facebook: Panel Democrats said the social network's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were plainly anticompetitive \u2014 that the company made the deals to stop Instagram from becoming a competitor to its main platform and WhatsApp from becoming a competitor to its messaging service. </p><p>(CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook had no idea the two would become such juggernauts when it bought them.)Google: Lawmakers homed in on the company's acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007 as the watershed moment when its dominance of search combined with power over the levers of online ad targeting. Amazon faced tough questions about its role as both a massively successful online retailer and the proprietor of the biggest online marketplace for third-party sellers.Apple took sustained heat for its power over the iPhone's App Store and the cut it takes from developers who sell digital products through their apps. All the companies, subcommittee chair David Cicilline said, have become bottlenecks for distribution, using their chokehold over data to surveil potential competitors and their control over technologies to extend their power. Yes, but: The CEOs dodged most of the bullets aimed at them. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, testifying for the first time before Congress, sustained the most damage. Asked if Amazon has ever broken its rule against tapping specific third-party seller data to develop its own competing products, Bezos said he couldn't rule it out. He also acknowledged that the \"aggregate data\" Amazon does allow its employees to examine can come from as few as two or three marketplace sellers.Asked if Amazon used data from companies that use its AWS cloud unit to develop competing products, Bezos first said he wasn't aware of the company doing so and then acknowledged it may learn things about AWS clients that it uses in product development. The catch: Lawmakers repeatedly cited instances where the companies acted ruthlessly, but antitrust laws don't bar ruthless competition unless you're a proven monopolist. Each of these companies wields enormous power. But antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission won't be able to use the evidence the committee assembled to build an antitrust case unless they can also define markets[1] and prove that these companies dominate them.The antitrust panel did little on that front Wednesday. They raised no objections, for instance, as Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook cited examples of intense competition they face in various lines of business.They spent more time drilling down on the methods Facebook, Amazon and others used to develop copycat versions of other firms' products and apps. Between the lines: Zuckerberg was quick to note that regulators at the time raised no objection to Facebook's acquisitions. That argument only underscored the deeper unspoken assumption behind the Democrats' attack. Our existing system brought us to this point, they seemed to say, where a handful of private companies dictate the terms of how people talk, consume, work and play online. Time to change that system. The other side: Panel Democrats like Reps. Pramila Jayapal, Joe Neguse and antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline drove tough lines of evidence-based inquiry, and a couple of their Republican counterparts joined in. But most of the GOP representatives used their time to repeat the litany of charges of anti-conservative bias that they have been pressing in the Capitol for two years[2]. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said \"Big tech is out to get conservatives\" and pressed the CEOs one by one to denounce \"cancel culture.\"Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) spent several minutes needling Google CEO Sundar Pichai on why Gmail is filing his campaign emails to supporters' and family members' spam folders. Our thought bubble: Republicans normally provide the \"hands off business\" side of the antitrust argument, but their obsession with bias and \"censorship\" charges left that perspective with few advocates in this debate.

Four of the largest technology companies, Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon, are set to testify before Congress today on whether or not they have consolidated too much power, are behaving responsibly. Ursula von der Leyen was confirmed by a very slim margin today as first female president of the European Commission.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BIANCA NOBILO, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Hello and welcome. I'm Bianca Nobilo, sitting in for Hala Gorani.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, all eyes are on Capitol Hill this hour for two very different but very important stories. Right now, Congress is getting ready to grill representatives from Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google about how these huge companies are changing the world that we live in. Do they have too much power? And what's to be done if they do?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, we're looking at more reaction from members of Congress as U.S. President Donald Trump once again defends himself over his racist tweet against four Democratic congresswomen. And that's where we begin tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Trump just spoke at a cabinet meeting, doubling down on his insults and name-calling, after insisting that he doesn't have a racist bone in his body. He's standing by his tweet that said four minority lawmakers, all American citizens, should return to their, quote, \"crime-ridden countries.\" U.S. president is attempting to justify those remarks by attacking the character of the women.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- go wherever they want, or they can stay. But they should love our country. They shouldn't hate our country. You look at what they've said, I have clips right here. The most vile, horrible statements about our country, about Israel, about others. It's up to them. They can do what they want. They can leave, they can stay. But they should love our country and they should work for the good of our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: One of the congresswomen targeted by Mr. Trump tweeted a response today. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says that the president can't handle America's enshrined tradition of dissent. Adding, quote, \"We don't leave the things we love.\"</p><p>Mr. Trump says Republicans must not show weakness, urging them to vote against a Democratic-sponsored bill that would condemn his racist remarks. That vote is expected in the House later on today.</p><p>So let's get the latest now from CNN congressional correspondent Phil Mattingly.</p><p>Phil, good to have you with us. Yesterday was characterized mainly from -- by and large, by silence on the Republicans' part. How's the mood been today? Have we heard more from the Republican Party in response to the president's tweets?</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN U.S. CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We have. And I think what we've heard, more than we heard yesterday at any point, was a defense of the president. You saw House Republican leadership hold their first on-camera remarks this morning, and every single one of them defended the president.</p><p>Defended his intent and did almost exactly what the president has tried to do, and try and spin everything related to the tweets, including the racist elements of the tweets, back towards the four Democratic congresswomen that the president was initially targeting, talking about their policies, talking about their intentions, talking about how they talk about the country. That is where, at least that group of Republicans, has decided to go.</p><p>Now, it's not monolithic. Over in the United States Senate, Republicans have been more circumspect. They have certainly been critical of the president's comments, some have asked him to take it down, the tweet down. Some have called them racist, many have called them divisive.</p><p>TEXT: Trump Posts Racist Tweets, says progressive Dems should \"go back\" to the countries they came from: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York, born in New York; Rashida Tlaib, Michigan, born in Detroit; Ilhan Omar, Minnesota, born in Mogadishu, Somalia; Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts, born in Cincinnati</p><p>MATTINGLY: But when you talk to the top members of the Republican Party inside the United States Capitol, it becomes very clear that they have made the calculation that defending the president, if not necessarily defending the specifics of the tweet, is the route that they're going to go.</p><p>Which, to be honest, Bianca, is a dance we've seen repeatedly over the course of the last two and a half years, where you don't want to inflame the president or make the president attack you, particularly when he's supported by 90 percent of the party. And that's, at least for now, the posture that they've decided to take.</p><p>NOBILO: And, Phil, there is now this Democrat-sponsored bill, which intends to officialize the condemnation of President Trump's tweet. Talk us through the process of that later on today, and also what the Democrats are hoping to achieve by pushing that through, if they can.</p><p>MATTINGLY: So it's interesting. You've had Democrats -- obviously you had Ilhan Omar, one of the congresswomen targeted by the president, targeted by name during his press conference yesterday, talk about impeachment, saying that's how far they need to go. Other Democrats wanted an official censure on the floor.</p><p>What Democratic leaders have done is decided to go a step below both of those options. That is a resolution condemning the president's tweet specifically. And they wrote it in a tight manner, making it just about the tweet in an effort to garner, A, more support, potentially some Republican support, but also ensure that they don't create any fissures or divides inside their own caucus.</p><p>What that ends up being, they will condemn the tweets themselves in a closed-door meeting. The speaker gave kind of a rousing defense of the four congresswomen that were attacked by the president. But what we're hearing right now is, Republicans are not going to sign on. You're not going to get any more than four or five or six Republicans. Republicans are staying united.</p><p>Democrats are hoping to send a message and get a political win by forcing Republicans to vote no on this. But any idea that there's unanimity up here between the two parties -- condemning this, it's certainly out the window at this point, Bianca.</p><p>[14:05:01] NOBILO: Phil Mattingly in Washington, thank you.</p><p>We're going to go now to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who's speaking now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: -- vile accusations and insults against our nation have become incredibly routine. And we've seen back and forth over the past few days.</p><p>Most of you know, Justice Scalia was my sort of all-time favorite. Now, here's what he used to say. He said, \"I don't attack people, I attack ideas.\" And I think that's a good lesson for all of us, from the president to the speaker to freshman members of the House, all of us have a responsibility to elevate the public discourse.</p><p>Our words do matter. We all know politics is a contact sport. But it's about time we lowered the temperature all across the board. All of us ought to contribute to a better level of discourse.</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): And on a more upbeat note, there's good news in the economy again. And we're going to be dealing with some issues on the floor this week that relate directly to the economy. We are going to be processing (ph) --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: You've just been hearing from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, there. He was giving his own remarks on what's happened over the past 24 hours. He was saying that even though politics is a combat sport, that it was their responsibility to elevate the discourse and take down the temperature of debate. So that's been his contribution.</p><p>So, moving on now. Far from apologizing or even backtracking, at least one other member of Donald Trump's administration seems to be leaning into the issue of race, or at least ethnicity, as a talking point now. Take a listen to top advisor Kellyanne Conway.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: We should be talking about it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Following up on the previous question, if the president was not telling these four congresswomen to return to their supposed countries of origin, to which countries was he referring? He didn't say --</p><p>CONWAY: What's your ethnicity?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) why is that relevant?</p><p>CONWAY: No, no. Because I'm asking a question. My ancestors are from Ireland and Italy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My -- my ethnicity's not relevant to the question I'm asking.</p><p>CONWAY: No, no. It is, OK? You're asking about --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm asking --</p><p>CONWAY: -- he said \"originally.\" He said originally from.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am -- I am asking --</p><p>CONWAY: And, you know, everything you said since, and to have a full conversation --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So are you saying that the president was telling the Palestinian-American (ph) to go back --</p><p>CONWAY: The president's already commented on that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: Our White House reporter Stephen Collinson says this controversy is rooted in conflicting ideas about what it means to be American. And he says it's electrifying the bases of both the Democratic and Republican Parties. Stephen joins us now from Washington, but we're also joined by Liz Mair, a Republican strategist who's advised several prominent politicians.</p><p>Great to have you both. Stephen, let's start with you. And we just played a bit of footage there, of Kellyanne Conway. It's quite bizarre, and she's a very important person in the Trump administration. What do you make of that exchange?</p><p>STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: I think quite a few of the things, these days, that Kellyanne Conway says are quite bizarre, in her interactions with reporters. Just the atmosphere down there at the White House is so poisoned that I don't think we can take too much stock in that.</p><p>What I think think we're seeing today, very interestingly, is an attempt by the Republican Party and the president to rebrand this dispute. They're saying this is not about race, this is about what they see as the extreme left-wing positions adopted by this group of four progressive women of color in the Democratic Party, who they would like to make the face of the Democratic Party.</p><p>The problem is, I mean, that is a legitimate attack, had the president not come out and made this about race. He used the most basic trope about race against people of color, saying, \"You should go back to where you came from,\" effectively, in a tweet that weekend. You know, that can't be unsaid.</p><p>Clearly, the Republican Party does not want to criticize the president. He has huge approval ratings among Republican voters, so this is a solution. They've got to try and defuse this a little bit, but the fact remains that the president of the United States is openly tearing at some of the country's deepest racial divides, using his platform to do that. This is not something that can be spun away.</p><p>NOBILO: Liz, thanks for being on the program. You've advised both Jeb Bush and John McCain. I'd like to know how you've been advising --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LIZ MAIR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Actually, let me just clarify that. I haven't advised Jeb Bush, in fact --</p><p>NOBILO: Yes?</p><p>MAIR: -- but yes, John McCain, yes indeed, yes.</p><p>NOBILO: So if you were advising a prominent Republican now, how would you -- how would you suggest that they respond to what the president has said? And if you could give us a little bit of insight into what the -- what the calculus is for prominent Republicans at the moment, who of course need to be showing some support for their president, but then may feel a real imperative to respond to what's been happening over the past 24 hours.</p><p>MAIR: Well, my advice, really, to any candidate -- and it doesn't matter who they are or where in the party they are -- is that they always need to say what they actually think and what they actually believe. Because voters can smell inauthenticity a mile off. And that's one of the things people like about Donald Trump.</p><p>I think, unfortunately, there are a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill who mistake Republican affection for Donald Trump as something to do with policies or specific statements like this that he makes, which is not actually what this is about at all. It's about the fact that he speaks his mind.</p><p>And I think they should be speaking their minds too. And I believe that the overwhelming majority of them really do take issue with these comments, and should stand up and say so.</p><p>NOBILO: Stephen, I mentioned in the introduction how the analysis that you've been doing over the past couple of days is focused on the fact that there are conflicting ideas about what America is. Explain what you mean by that a little bit more.</p><p>And also is President Trump choosing to make these kinds of statements? Because he knows that it will electrify his base. And know that he's been in office for a number of years with an eye on 2020, he doesn't want to seem like a regular member of the establishment, not that he ever would. But he wants to try and, you know, carve out that space for himself, again as that outsider figure.</p><p>COLLINSON: Well, the president, ever since he started running for office, you know, the first few moments he made those inflammatory remarks about Mexicans, he has rooted his political --</p><p>NOBILO: Exactly.</p><p>COLLINSON: -- appeal in an ability to detect cultural and social divides and to exploit them. The way that he's conducted his presidency, many presidents from both sides of the aisle try to broaden their support when their president, Donald Trump, has stuck to what got him to the White House and win or lose, that's the way he's going to conduct the 2020 campaign.</p><p>TEXT: Housing Discrimination; Central Park 5; Birtherism; Racially Divisive Campaign Rhetoric; Hispanic Judge; \"Pocahontas\" Insults; Muslim Travel Ban; Charlottesville; Anthem Protests; Puerto Rico Tweets; Sh**hole Countries; Immigration Policies/Targets</p><p>COLLINSON: I think it's interesting because it shows a little bit of flexibility, the U.S. political system. These four progressive congresswomen from the Democratic Party, known as \"The Squad,\" who are far to the right of their own party, in fact -- were part of the reaction to Trump's election and the tactics he used to get elected in 2016.</p><p>They came to power in the 2018 election, from an electrified grassroots base of the Democratic Party, which is a reaction to the president. So it's very interesting, seeing these two forces collide.</p><p>I think the interesting question is, the perceived political wisdom is that these kind of tactics, inflammatory comments on race and immigration, were what got Donald Trump elected and will get him re-elected.</p><p>That does perhaps conflict with the evidence that we have of the last few weeks of the midterm election, where -- I mean, I think there's a good case you can make, that some of this rhetoric actually alienated some of the most important voters in suburban areas, who decided that midterm election.</p><p>So, yes, it looks like it's going to be an election in 2020 of who can get the most base voters out. I think there are certainly (ph) questions about whether the same tactics are going to work again for Donald Trump.</p><p>NOBILO: Liz, just last question to you. This vote that we're expecting later today, condemning the president's tweets, how damaging would that be for the president and how do you expect most of the Republicans to respond to that?</p><p>MAIR: I don't think it's probably going to be particularly damaging. Usually, votes like this, you know, I understand I'm speaking to an international audience here, but usually votes like this are taken so that Democrats can run campaign ads, hitting Republicans for not taking the right vote.</p><p>So they could come into play, this sort of vote could come into play in the 2020 election. But I think the point that was just made is really the salient thing. You know, Trump thinks that speaking this way is a winning issue for him because he thinks it motivates his base.</p><p>But that actually did not work out in 2018. And I would argue in 2016, it didn't either. It's just the fact that Hillary Clinton was such an abysmal candidate, and we'd already had eight years of a Democratic presidency, that people were willing to take a punt on Donald Trump. And they did it in very, very small numbers in a handful of states, and he barely eked out a win.</p><p>And that's why people should be extremely concerned about these kinds of remarks, because it's a big liability for him going into 2020.</p><p>NOBILO: Yes. What I'm hearing from both of you there, is that some of the tactics that worked in the last election might not be quite so effective this time.</p><p>Liz Mair and Stephen Collinson, both in Washington, thank you.</p><p>How we communicate, how we search for information, how we consume products, basically everything that we do has been radically transformed by the internet and the instant information that it provides.</p><p>[14:15:00] This hour, some of the companies that dominate the World Wide Web's information flow are under the harshest of spotlights. Executives will soon be in front of a congressional hearing in Washington, with lawmakers asking, \"Do they have too much power?\"</p><p>Earlier, senators took a closer look at Facebook. Specifically, at its new cryptocurrency, Libra. It led to some sharp words from one Senate Democrat.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN SHERROD BROWN (D-OH): Their motto has been, \"Move fast and break things.\" They certainly have. They moved fast, and broke our political discourse. They moved fast and broke journalism, they moved fast and helped incite a genocide. They moved fast and they're helping to undermine our democracy.</p><p>Now, Facebook asks people to trust them with their hard-earned paychecks. Takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance, a breathtaking amount of arrogance, to look at that track record and think, \"You know what we really ought to do next? You know what we ought to do next? Let's run our own bank and our own for-profit version of the Federal Reserve. And let's do it for the whole world.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us live now from New York.</p><p>Clare, the supporters of Libra espouse its benefits, particularly for the developing world. I'd like to ask you how big those advantages are likely to be, and also if the international banking system, or people who are concerned about privacy, should have cause for concern here.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So, Bianca, one of the big selling points, as Facebook has tried to explain to us what Libra and their own unit, Calibra, is, is that it has the power, they say, to bank the unbanked, to reach people who so far haven't had access to traditional financial services.</p><p>And, look, if they are able to overhaul the system of remittances, for example to bring down the costs to make the whole process more seamless, clearly, that could have huge advantages for some of the poorer countries in the world, for emerging markets.</p><p>But where those countries are concerned, there is a secondary problem here, a secondary concern, is that if Libra turns out to be as stable a currency as Facebook says it is, it could turn out to be more stable than the currencies in some of these emerging markets, and that could further undermine these currencies. I'm thinking, of course, about places like Venezuela and Iran. So that's a consideration.</p><p>And of course, when it comes to the international banking system, there are concerns. We just don't know exactly how this system will be regulated yet. Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve in the U.S., has said that it raises serious concerns when it comes to financial stability. It could disrupt monetary policy, given that it might be pegged, among other things, to the U.S. dollar.</p><p>So a lot of unanswered questions here. And we saw that, you know, with some of the more fiery exchanges on Capitol Hill today.</p><p>NOBILO: And, Clare, what are some of the other big points of tension between the government and the big tech companies?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So I think, you know, you're going to see this play out in this second hearing of the day, which is before the House Judiciary Committee. We're going to see representatives from Facebook as well as Google And Apple and Amazon. And, again, the real concern here is that too much power is being concentrated in the hands of too few companies.</p><p>This is a committee that's launched a top-to-bottom antitrust hearing. We're going to see issues like, you know, Amazon's dominance of online retail, which they have achieved by subsidizing their retail business with their high-margin cloud business.</p><p>There's going to be questions, probably, about Apple's app store, the fact that Facebook and Google dominate most of online search. You know, these companies have been, really, the high-growth stars of the stock market in recent years. But we've got to a situation now where lawmakers are increasingly worried that they have the power to stifle innovation and to block smaller companies from entering these critical marketplaces -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Clare Sebastian in New York, thank you.</p><p>You can go to CNN.com/business to watch those hearings, live.</p><p>Still to come tonight, a former Italian senate candidate is under arrest. What police found in his home is raising so much concern.</p><p>Also ahead, the E.U. commission will have a woman at the helm for the first time. We'll bring you the latest as MEPs confirm Germany's Ursula von der Leyen for the top job.</p><p>[14:21:15] NOBILO: Welcome back. Italian police have seized a weapons arsenal of Nazi paraphernalia from the home of a former neo-fascist political candidate. He's one of three people under arrest, accused of possessing and trying to sell an air-to-air missile.</p><p>Police say they've been investigating Italian extremists who fought with Russian-based separatist forces in Ukraine. Barbie Nadeau has more on this story. She joins us now, live from Rome.</p><p>Barbie, this does have a curious backstory as well. Talk us through that and explain what's led to this investigation, what they found and what's likely to happen next.</p><p>BARBIE NADEAU, CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE, THE DAILY BEAST: Well this is, as you mentioned, part of a larger investigation that has already netted a number of people, including three people who were convicted of terrorism charges in early July.</p><p>And they were really looking more at people who had terrorist affiliations. They weren't particularly looking for this sort of weapons cache. But they found an incredible air-to-air missile, they found a cache of around 800 bullets, they found 300 gun parts that included silencers and sights and things like that.</p><p>And all this was sort of against the backdrop of this Nazi paraphernalia, including signs mentioning Adolf Hitler, swastikas and a number of very, very disturbing pieces of evidence that are going to be used against these.</p><p>And this was a man who ran for office for -- and served in office for the Forza Nuova, which is a far-right party here in Italy, and was an elected official and had quite a following. So that also adds to the layer of intrigue and to what the investigators are going to do next and what they're looking for -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Barbie Nadeau in Rome, thank you.</p><p>We want to bring you the very latest, now, from the European Parliament. Ursula von der Leyen has just been confirmed as the next president of the E.U. Commission. The German defense minister and ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nominated for the E.U.'s top job after a pretty torturous set of negotiations by E.U. leaders.</p><p>She'll replace Jean-Claude Juncker and will be the first woman to ever hold the position. But her confirmation has been anything but plain sailing. She was forced to court MEPs on the left with an array of policy promises, to get her confirmation over the line. And of course, the process has exposed some sharp divisions within the European Parliament.</p><p>So let's bring in Erin McLaughlin now. She joins me on-set to discuss all of this.</p><p>Erin, first and foremost, she's been confirmed but this wasn't the result that was expected.</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: No. My sources expressed, saying they were surprised, to me. Several, sending me the text, \"Not good,\" by the fact that she has a very slim majority of only nine votes, 383 votes in favor. She needed 374 to get the absolute majority necessary.</p><p>But when you compare that to, say, Jean-Claude Juncker in 2014, he had a 56-vote majority. So from the very beginning, this has been an uphill battle for von der Leyen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over): She was the dark-horse candidate, the name few saw coming, the European Council's choice for the E.U.'s top job. Forced upon a fractured European Parliament, which had put forward a list of preferred nominees, but no one could command a majority. And so, unexpectedly, Ursula von der Leyen's name was put forward.</p><p>Her overarching message? The need for unity.</p><p>URSULA VON DER LEYEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: If we are to go down the European path, we must first rediscover our unity. If we are united on the inside, nobody will divide us from the outside.</p><p>[14:25:05] MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over): Von der Leyen was perhaps not the obvious choice to be the first female to lead the E.U. She just resigned as Germany's defense minister, a position widely regarded as the poisoned chalice of German politics.</p><p>The mother of seven, a doctor educated at the London School of Economics, she was fond of singing. Her childhood nickname? The Little Rose. She entered local politics in 2001, positioning herself to the left of Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats.</p><p>But her candidacy for the Commission presidency was supported by Europe's hard-right, yet another potential stumbling block to securing a majority within the pro-E.U. parliament. But little by little, von der Leyen won over skeptical MEPs with promises to help strengthen its hand in deciding her successor in five years' time, and a commitment to new and ambitious green targets.</p><p>She didn't please everyone. Some refused to support her on principle, outraged by back-room deals that led to her candidacy.</p><p>VON DER LEYEN: Are you going to be, like previous commissions, the lap dog of those member states? Or are you going to be the pit bull that I would like you to be? That's what I need to hear.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN (voice-over): But to others, von der Leyen signifies a fresh start, new energy the E.U.'s leadership so badly needs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: And in the last couple of minutes, we've had some sound in from the new commission president. Let's take a listen to what she had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VON DER LEYEN: The task ahead of us humbles me. It's a big responsibility and my work starts now. I thank President Sassoli. I thank all the group leaders. I thank all the members of parliament who decided to vote for me today. But my message to all of you is, \"Let us work together constructively\" because the endeavor is a united, a strong Europe. Thank you very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: \"The task ahead humbles me,\" is what we've just heard from her. So what do you think the defining challenges are going to be for this president?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I think it's very clear at this point. And the defining challenge will be, form a stable majority. Keep in mind that this was the product of a secret ballot. So we don't know who really formulates her majority, who are those nine votes. Are they populists, are they far- right, are they far-left.</p><p>NOBILO: And even that calls into question what we've been discussing, which is the charges against the E.U. for having a democratic deficit, the fact that we don't even know who's in support of her.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well, and then in addition to that, it is thought that some Tory MEPs actually voted for her, some Labour MEPs actually voted for her. So she was asked, in the press conference following the vote, what happens after Brexit. \"Are you going to go back and try and test this majority?\"</p><p>And she said, no, she's going to be working in the meantime towards forming that stable majority. Because as she points out, she's an unknown so she's still working, getting to know these MEPs, trying to form, you know, a broader coalition, so to speak, of support to be able to move forward.</p><p>Because sources are acknowledging to me that nine really is not enough. There's no room to maneuver. It gives stronger emphasis to the dissident vote within parliament.</p><p>NOBILO: The British government's majority still looks good by comparison though. Erin McLaughlin, thank you very much.</p><p>[14:28:26] Still to come on the program tonight, what is it about these women that provokes such outrage from the president of the United States? We'll get some insight from a philosopher who studies both democracy and race. That's coming up.</p><p>[14:30:04] NOBILO: Welcome back, the U.S. president's torrent of racist tweets and comments are reverberating far beyond Washington. The latest stoking of racial division has seen by many as a preview of what's in store during Donald Trump's reelection campaign. Democrats are outraged of the hateful language lobbed at four first-year democratic members of Congress. All of them are women of color.</p><p>Well, a few Republicans also say the tweets are over the line, most in Mr. Trump's party seem not to say that they're that bothered. A few of them even praising the attacks.</p><p>Just minutes ago -- actually, we're going to go to Cornel West, he's going to join us now as our guest. It is great to have you on our program.</p><p>Let's have your response to what President Trump has said, and also the fact that he's doubled down today, and then also said that his tweets were not racist, that he doesn't have a racist bone in his body. It strikes me that even with the most sympathetic reading of this situation, the president forfeits the right to misspeak or think without great -- or speak without great consideration when he takes the office of president. So, what do you make of this situation?</p><p>CORNEL WEST, PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC PHILOSOPHY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: I think the important thing is to put it in the larger context and recognize that as the great (INAUDIBLE) used to say, is America unique among nations to move from perceived innocence to corruption without a mediating stage of maturity.</p><p>And there's no doubt that we have a president, head of the American empire, who lacks maturity. Maturity has to do with really confronting complicated realities, wrestling with the best of your history and trying to ensure that you don't bring your democratic experiment to a close to an end.</p><p>And President Trump just strikes one as an adolescence. He's yet to really grow up. He's in a presidential adult position and there's no doubt he's a vicious racist and xenophobic characterization. You don't tell the people of color to go back to your country, prime invested country.</p><p>We've seen over and over and over again this racist vitriolic language. And so it's not a question of just acknowledging it's racist but it's tied to a deeply conservative view of the world in which you hide and conceal your expansion of your military. You hide and conceal the expansion of the wealth inequality and the big money ruling, and then try to somehow demonized or as the word scapegoat, the most vulnerable as the most powerful continue to augment their strength.</p><p>And so this is a larger issue, not just about racist, race, predatory, capitalism, ugly forms of patriarch, and misogyny, and trying to demonized immigrants, especially those new arrival from Mexico.</p><p>NOBILO: Cornel, from the perspective of the four congresswomen, the recipients of these racist attacks. Obviously, they occupy the moral high ground in this situation when they are the ones that are being attacked by the president. How do you think their response has been? Do you feel like it was the opposite response to what the president said?</p><p>WEST: Well, it's a wonderful question, my dear sister, Bianca. I'm very, very delighted to see the courage and the poise of my four sisters who represent, not just women of color, but women of color who are wedded, deeply committed to the plate of foreign working people. There's a whole lot of people of color who had not committed the foreign working people. We know that class is tied to race and gender and sexual orientation in complicated ways.</p><p>So he's targeting these particular four highly progressive, courageous, visionary women of color and I thought that they responded in a powerful way. And their response was in part of what? We know it's racist, of course, two plus two is four, the sky is blue, grass is green, and President Trump is racist.</p><p>[14:35:13] OK. Now, let's move on not be distracted by his attempt of hide and conceal what's happening to those precious children at the border from Mexico. What's happening on Wall Street, what's happening military industrial complex? What about the nine countries who are being bombed by either U.S. or U.S. -assisted military forces, nine countries in the world right now.</p><p>Let's not lose sight of these ugly realities and let's try to build on the best of America, the best of the human spirit which is Socratic, prophetic, democratic, trying to acknowledge the ways in which ordinary people ought to be at the center of how we look at the world.</p><p>NOBILO: It feels almost prude and reductionist to mention the 2020 election when we're talking about such high ideals as Americanism and the human spirit. But through the prism of the 2020 election that's coming up, how do you think this is going to affect both sides? And what do you think would be the most effective counter by Democratic Party to this kind of rhetoric and approach from the Trump administration?</p><p>WEST: Well, I think one, a centrist candidate will not do. Joe Biden will not do. Kamala Harris will not do. What Bernie sanders represents is an attempt to say, lo and behold, they're going to use old McCarthy strategies, you must be a communist, you must be a socialist, you must be pro-terrorist. We've seen this with Lindsey Graham, the Senator Graham, who would really is a cartoonist version of Joseph McCarthy, really.</p><p>But he was using this language. They're going to try to paint the democratic party as communist, as socialist, as pro-terrorist, we've got to hit him head on with energy, with enthusiasm, with vision, with courage.</p><p>When you're dealing with bullies and gangsters, you don't then present a timid and a centrist message. You got to be on fire with something bigger than you and bigger than them, so that you tame their negative flames and allow American people to see, and in fact, the world to see the best of America. There is always the best of America, Martin Luther King, Jr. and John Coltrane, and Fannie Lou Hamer, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, and Dorothy Day are good places to start.</p><p>NOBILO: Cornel West, thank you very much for joining us and sharing your insights. I appreciate it.</p><p>WEST: Thank you so very much.</p><p>NOBILO: And one more note on this top story. Just minutes ago, the top Republican in the U.S. Senate, Mitch McConnell, finally weighed in on the President Trump's tweets. He would not discuss Mr. Trump's attacks directly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're just not sure of calling his comments racist.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Well, the president is not a racist. The president is not a racist. And I think the tone of all of this is not good for the country. But it's coming from all different ideological points of view. That's the point. To single out any segment of this, I think is a mistake. It had been discounted rhetoric from a whole lot of different sources all across the ideological spectrum in our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, remains in a British jail fighting extradition to the United States. Well, he's suspected of meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He took refuge in Ecuador's embassy for years, before he was finally knocked out this April.</p><p>Now, CNN has discovered new evidence that Assange used the embassy not just as a refuge but also as a base of operations.</p><p>Alex Marquardt has an exclusive report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election, Ecuador's embassy in London turned into a command post for WikiLeaks. At its helm, the Web site's founder, Julian Assange, who was living there in political asylum.</p><p>In stunning new detail, hundreds of security reports, videos, and photos obtained exclusively by CNN, and verified by an Ecuadorian intelligence official, describe how Assange released stolen Democratic e-mails directly from the embassy and who he met with -- world-class hackers and Russians tied to the Kremlin.</p><p>The explosive material, when lined up with the time line in the Mueller report, paints a striking picture of how Assange orchestrated the game- changing document dumps from just a few rooms in the embassy.</p><p>The exclusively-obtained surveillance reports show that the WikiLeaks founder, who had been given asylum in 2012 --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Inside this embassy --</p><p>MARQUARDT: -- wielded enormous power in the building, rivaling even the ambassadors with whom he would regularly clash. As these exclusive security photo show, he even got physical with the embassy guards.</p><p>[14:40:08] The documents describe how Assange demanded and got high-speed Internet, phones -- even a special guest list that allowed certain visitors to not show identification or be searched.</p><p>Even as it hosted him, Ecuador hired three different security companies to carry out surveillance of Assange, including Spain-based UC-Global, which compiled the reports obtained by CNN.</p><p>The never-before-seen cache of documents says Assange installed his own recording devices and used sound machines so he couldn't be listened to, all of which may have played a role in his election interference.</p><p>Assange has denied working for the Kremlin or receiving the stolen e-mails from Russia. WikiLeaks did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office.</p><p>MARQUARDT: It was June of 2016, Trump and Hillary Clinton were the de facto nominees. It was looking like it was going to be a bitter election.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft.</p><p>MARQUARDT: That month, according to the Mueller report, WikiLeaks communicated secretly with unidentified online personas who turned out to be Russian hackers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the number of visits paid to Assange at the embassy dramatically picked up. The reports exclusively obtained by CNN show one frequent visitor was this man, Andrew Muller-Maguhn, a hacker whom the special counsel wrote, \"May have assisted with the transfer of these stolen documents to WikiLeaks.\"</p><p>ANDREW MULLER-MAGUHN, MEMBER, GERMAN HACKER ASSOCIATION CHAOS COMPUTER CLUB: If you look at the Internet from perspective of people in power --</p><p>MARQUARDT: Muller-Maguhn had appeared on Assange's short-lived show on RT, the Russian T.V. network that gets its marching orders from the Kremlin.</p><p>The security logs show that RT's London bureau chief, Nikolay Bogachikhin, also visited that month, twice. And during one visit that lasted only five minutes, he gave Assange a USB drive.</p><p>Bogachikhin defended his visits to Assange, telling CNN, \"RT has produced multiple programming featuring Mr. Assange. Within that process, everything that is intrinsically involved in the production of content took place.\"</p><p>Muller-Maguhn declined to comment to CNN but told the Washington Post he never had the hacked materials before they were released.</p><p>But, U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded RT actively collaborated with WikiLeaks, playing a significant role in Russia's efforts to help Trump win, which RT denies.</p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Russian hackers have breached the computer network of the Democratic National Committee.</p><p>MARQUARDT: On June 14th, 2016, the Democratic National Committee announced it had been hacked and accused Russia of being responsible. Trump dismissed allegations of Russian involvement, instead suggesting the DNC hacked itself.</p><p>Five days later, according to the exclusive documents, Assange got new equipment for data transmission. The embassy's security attache even helped install it.</p><p>On July 6th, WikiLeaks reached out to the Russian hackers who used the names Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks. \"Those are covers,\" the Mueller report says, \"for Russian military intelligence.\"</p><p>\"The Democratic National Convention is approaching,\" WikiLeaks warned the Russians,\" and Clinton will solidify Bernie Sanders supporters behind her.\" Eight days later, the group received encrypted files, according to the Mueller report, with the name \"Big archive.\" That same day, Assange met again for more than four hours with Muller-Maguhn, one of at least a dozen times they met at the embassy before the election, according to the security reports.</p><p>On the day the Republican National Convention kicks off, the security photos show a man in a mask and sunglasses arriving at the embassy. A guard left his post and collected a package. The documents suggest this was an arranged meeting.</p><p>It's unclear whether that was related to a message sent the same day, July 18th, when WikiLeaks told the Russian hackers, according to the Mueller report, that they received the files and would release them \"this week.\"</p><p>CROWD: Hell, no, DNC. We won't vote for Hillary.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Four days later, WikiLeaks released a trove of stolen files and all hell breaks loose. More than 20,000 e-mails from the DNC showing the preference of top officials for Clinton over Bernie Sanders.</p><p>When the Democratic Convention opened, it was consumed by chaos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everybody settle down, please.</p><p>MARQUARDT: The DNC chair had to step down and Trump pounced.</p><p>TRUMP: Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing.</p><p>MARQUARDT: As the election entered its final weeks, Russia, according to Mueller, wrote WikiLeaks offering more files. \"You won't be disappointed,\" the hackers wrote.</p><p>After receiving several files from the Russian hackers in the immediate days prior, WikiLeaks started posting 50,000 e-mails stolen from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, revealing infighting and bickering.</p><p>[14:45:05] JOHN PODESTA, CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: If this was about transparency, then put them all out. So, they're dribbling them out.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Mueller's team suspects that transfer took place on September 19th, the same day Assange met again with hacker Andrew Muller-Maguhn, according to the security reports.</p><p>In the last month before the election, WikiLeaks released batch after batch of Podesta's e-mails.</p><p>TRUMP: This just came out. WikiLeaks -- I love WikiLeaks.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Transcripts of Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street, staffers criticizing her terrible instincts.</p><p>TRUMP: WikiLeaks -- this WikiLeaks is unbelievable.</p><p>MARQUARDT: The U.S. government decided to get involved, according to a U.S. official and documents obtained by CNN, warning Ecuador, stop Assange or there will be consequences. Just three weeks before the election, Ecuador cut Assange off. No more phones, Internet or guests.</p><p>Shortly after, the embassy relented on guest restrictions and at 1:00 A.M. on October 19th, the security materials obtained by CNN show two WikiLeaks staffers showed up and took away about 100 hard drives. Security guards wanted to examine the hard drives but they couldn't. The WikiLeaks personnel were on the special list of people not to be searched.</p><p>One of the Ecuadorian ambassadors who worked at the embassy during Assange's stay told CNN he was never pressured by his government to give Assange special treatment.</p><p>But this past April, Assange's world came crashing down. The asylum, his lifeblood, was taken away by Ecuador's new president, citing his participation in U.S. election meddling. British police carried him out of the embassy.</p><p>JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUNDER, WIKILEAKS: The U.K. has no civility.</p><p>MARQUARDT: And the U.S. Justice Department unsealed secret charges, but not for anything related to the election. Instead, it was for soliciting and publishing classified Pentagon materials in 2010. Assange maintains his innocence.</p><p>And right on cue, Russia came to Assange's defense. Top officials accusing the U.S. of violating his rights, saying, \"The hand of democracy squeezes the throat of freedom.\"</p><p>MARQUARDT: Julian Assange is currently in a British prison, waiting his extradition hearing. That's due to take place next February in 2020, almost a year after he was arrested.</p><p>The extradition process is expected to be long and complicated, and if you ask prosecutors get their hands-on him, there is a long list of charges including 17 counts of violating the espionage act for obtaining and publishing those classified Pentagon documents, meaning, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.</p><p>Alex Marquardt, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: Still to come tonight, we'll take a ride with the man who help bust the largest human slavery operation in Britain. Stay with us.</p><p>[14:50:18] NOBILO: Now, CNN's Freedom Project. The list in Britain have dismantled the country's largest modern-day slavery network. A gang of eight people made millions of dollars by trafficking hundreds of victims from Poland and putting them to work, taking any money that they earned.</p><p>Phil Black spent some time with one of the men who brought the gang to justice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Peter's retro flat cap isn't a fashion choice, it's protection, a partial disguise. We can't show his face or mention his full name.</p><p>BLACK: There are people who want to hurt you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>BLACK: Peter's job is freeing slaves.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have been involved in 286 recuses.</p><p>BLACK: That's made enemies an inspired threats.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They want me to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair.</p><p>BLACK: Peter giving us a tour of Birmingham's dark under belly.

His stories are about real people, enslaved, exploited, controlled with unimaginable violence.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And a young female was tied up because she refused to do what the traffickers asked her to do, which is be involved in prostitution. She was tied up with a barbed wire and some parts of her body had been put on fire.</p><p>BLACK: But one case stands out for its extraordinary scale.</p><p>BLACK (on-camera): This is where some of those people were rescued?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, and the first victims.</p><p>BLACK (voice-over): The first people Peter ever rescued eventually led police to break out the U.K.s biggest known modern slavery operation.</p><p>These gang members all came from Poland, so do their victims. They targeted people with few options and convince them to travel to the U.K. for a better life. But this was the reality when they arrived, filthy, slum life conditions, threats, violence, force labor for almost no pay.</p><p>The victims were put to work for unsuspecting businesses while the gang collected wages through bank accounts they control. Police believe they made millions of pounds. Gang members brazenly and foolishly flaunted their wealth, one bought a Bentley.</p><p>Peter and his colleagues at the anti-slavery charity hope for justice, worked the case from his secret operations room. Together, they and the police identified 92 victims. But the gang is suspected of trafficking hundreds more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm afraid that there's still so many people believed that slavery was end 50 years ago and doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>BLACK: Peter takes us to a center that helps hundreds of homeless people in Birmingham every day. He says, this is where many former slaves end up after their captors can no longer make money from them. This center has identified 45 slavery victims in the last year alone.</p><p>BLACK (on-camera): So this recent prosecution, this gang, it's not a one- off?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. There are more gangs that are still operating. We won the battle, but the war is not over yet.</p><p>BLACK (voice-over): British authorities believe slavery is a booming trade across the country, likely, involving tens of thousands of victims. Peter says he'll continue working to find threats, helping to free, scared, vulnerable people one at a time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are victims --</p><p>BLACK: Phil Black, CNN, Birmingham, England.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: And British officials say potential trafficking victims came from some 130 countries last year.

Congress authorized $7.3b in 2015 to cover claims through the end of 2020, but funds have quickly been depleted across 20,000 people enrolled in the program.</p><p>Data released by the 9/11 fund in January showed a 235% surge in death claims compared to the end of 2015. The number individuals suffering from cancer and filing eligible claims has also ballooned.</p><p>\"Certainly 9/11 first responders shouldn't have to decide whether to live or to have a place to live,\" Stewart said. \"More of these men and women are going to get sick, and they are going to die.\"</p><p>He also took aim at those who dismiss 9/11 funding as a 'New York issue', stating:</p><p> Al-Qaeda didn't shout 'death to Tribeca'. They attacked America. And these men and women, and their response to it, is what brought our country back. It's what gave our reeling nation a solid foundation to stand back upon... And you are ignoring them.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry if I sound angry and undiplomatic, but I am angry and you should be too,\" added Stewart, who received a standing ovation at the conclusion of his statement. </p><p>\"They responded in five seconds.

A jury deadlocked on a verdict on charges against a border activist who humanitarian aid groups say was just providing two migrants with water, food and lodging. President Trump pulled out a piece of paper earlier, claiming it was his deal with Mexico. Many speculated then that the paper was blank, but on enterprising Washington Post photojournalist managed to zoom in and enhance. House judiciary committee chair Jerry Nadler tells MSNBC's Ari Melber that former special counsel Robert Mueller will testify before the committee \"way before\" the end of summer. Mueller previously expressed reluctance at any sort of Capitol Hill appearance, making it known in his only public statement that everything he had to say was in the report. It is unknown whether this testimony before the committee \"way before\" the end of summer will be behind closed doors or public. \"We're carrying on conversations with him, and he will come in, and if we have to subpoena him, we will,\" Nadler said. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had strong words on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's opposition of the impeachment process: North Dakota's congressional delegation is urging the Trump administration to address the state's year-old request for $38m to cover the cost of policing protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline, the Associated Press is reporting. Senators John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and Representative Kelly Armstrong sent a letter Thursday calling for attorney general William Barr and acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan to settle the state's claim, filed last year by North Dakota's attorney general against the Army Corps of Engineers. The state is accusing the agency of letting protesters illegally camp on federal land in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017, and not maintaining law and order when thousands gathered to protest the $3.8bn pipeline. \"This administration has reset the precedent on permitting this type of project,\" the Bismarck Tribune reports the delegation wrote in the letter. \"But we urge you to also reset the federal government's precedent in these matters to maintain law and order on federal land and recognize the overwhelming responsibility the state and local authorities in North Dakota employed to maintain public safety.\" A jury deadlocked Tuesday on charges against a border activist who humanitarian aid groups say was just providing two migrants with water, food and lodging, the Associated Press is reporting. Scott Daniel Warren, a 36-year-old college geography instructor, was charged with conspiracy to transport and harbor migrants, and faced up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors argued that the men were not in distress and that Warren conspired to transport and harbor them at a property used for providing aid to migrants in an Arizona town near the US-Mexico border. Jurors said Monday that they couldn't reach a consensus but a federal judge told them to keep deliberating. The judge set a July 2 status hearing after the jury said it was deadlocked. The case played out as humanitarian groups say they are coming under increasing scrutiny while President Donald Trump's administration looks for new ways to clamp down on illegal immigration. Warren is one of nine members of the humanitarian aid group No More Deaths who have been charged with crimes related to their work. But he is the only one to face felony charges. In West Texas, a county attorney was detained earlier this year after stopping her car on a dark highway to pick up three young migrants who flagged her down. Teresa Todd was held briefly, and federal agents searched her cellphone. Border activists say they worry about what they see as the gradual criminalization of humanitarian action. Warren has said his case could set a dangerous precedent by expanding the definition of the crimes of transporting and harboring migrants to include people merely trying to help border-crossers in desperate need of water or other necessities. Warren and other volunteers with the No More Deaths group also were targeted earlier this year in separate federal misdemeanor cases after leaving water, canned food and other provisions for migrants hiking through the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in southern Arizona. In Warren's felony case, the defense team headed by Greg Kuykendall argued that Warren could not, in good conscience, turn away two migrants who had recently crossed the desert to enter the U.S. Thousands of migrants have died crossing the border since the mid-1990s, when heightened enforcement pushed migrant traffic into Arizona's scorching deserts. Here's a hell of a bump for Senator Cory Booker: the sometimes politically active pop icon Taylor Swift gave the 2020 hopeful a shoutout on Instagram, on which she has 118m followers, for signing her Equality Act petition: In case you missed it, Swift kicked off Pride Month by asking the Tennessee Republican senator Lamar Alexander to support the Equality Act, legislation that recently passed in the House that would extend civil rights protections to LGBTQ people by prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Read all about it below: Representative Steve King, the Iowa Republican stripped of all committee assignments following a litany of racist remarks and behavior, was banned from flying aboard Air Force One as President Trump traveled to Iowa today, CNN is reporting: King, who represents the state's 4th District in Western Iowa, asked the White House to join the President's entourage, but administration officials rejected the request, two officials familiar with the matter told CNN. Republican senators Joni Ernst of Iowa and Deb Fischer of Nebraska joined Trump aboard Air Force One. Ernst had not been planning to travel with the President, citing her voting schedule, but ended up flying to Iowa with Trump. House Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments following an interview with the New York Times in which King rhetorically said \"white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?\" These comments came after King endorsed a white nationalist candidate for Toronto mayor and tweeted support of far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders , and after he compared immigrants to dirt and used rhetoric common to the alt-right in an interview with a magazine affiliated with the far-right Austrian Freedom party. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Sabrina Siddiqui. Let's see where the day takes us, shall we? Ok folks, that's it from me, Sabrina Siddiqui... I'm handing over to my trusted colleague Vivian Ho, who will take you through the remainder of the day from the West Coast. But first, a recap of the day's events: The House of Representatives voted along party lines to hold attorney general William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in civil contempt; Democrats approved the resolution after Barr and McGahn defied congressional subpoenas seeking testimony and documents pertaining to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Joe Biden and Donald Trump provided a recap of a potential 2020 general election contest with dueling events in Iowa on Tuesday; Biden warned the president was an 'existential threat' to America, while Trump attacked the former vice president by questioning his mental fitness for office. A government watchdog group contends that Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, may have violated the law by failing to keep records of their meetings with foreign leaders; the group filed a lawsuit citing meetings between Trump and Kim Jong-un, and between Kushner and Saudi diplomats, in which no note takers were present and thus no public record was created. Donald Trump Jr will testify before the Senate intelligence committee behind closed doors on Wednesday; the appearance by the president's eldest son comes after the Republican-led panel issued a subpoena summoning Trump Jr to Capitol Hill following the release of the Mueller report. Stay tuned for more! In case there was any doubt Joe Biden is focusing his 2020 campaign on Donald Trump, the former vice president name-checked the president 44 times during his speech in Iowa on Tuesday. Campaigning in Ottumwa, Iowa, Biden declared Trump was \"literally an existential threat to America\" while condemning his record on foreign policy, race relations and trade. Biden also condemned Trump's conduct during his recent travel to Normandy, where he attacked his political rivals on a trip intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day. \"Did he do anything to signal that he's prepared to walk away from the thugs he's embraced on the world stage - from Putin to Kim Jong Un? No. He did none of that,\" Biden said. \"Instead, he gets up in the middle of the night to attack Bette Midler. He attacks the mayor of London. He attacks the American Speaker of the House. It was a stunning display of childishness for the whole world to see.\" Trump, who held his own speech in Iowa the same day, responded by questioning Biden's mental fitness as he departed the White House. \"I have to tell you, he's a different guy,\" Trump said of the former vice president. \"He looks different then he used to, he acts different than he used to, he is even slower than he used to be.\" \"So I don't know. But when he mentions my name that many times, I guess I should be complimented.\" Trump also claimed Biden was the Democratic candidate he most wanted to run against. Biden currently leads Trump in several swing state and national polls. On a party-line vote of 229-191, House Democrats passed a resolution that would enable lawmakers to go to court to enforce their subpoenas against Barr and McGahn. The vote had long been planned amid unprecedented efforts by Donald Trump's administration to stonewall Democrats' witness and document requests pertaining to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Democrats on the House judiciary committee voted last month to hold Barr in contempt of Congress after he refused to comply with a subpoena for the full unredacted Mueller report. McGahn separately heeded to instructions from the White House to refuse a subpoena calling upon him to testify before Congress. Despite a deal between Nadler and the Justice Department on Monday, paving the way for his panel to access some of Mueller's underlying evidence, House Democrats said they were proceeding with Tuesday's full floor vote to keep the option to enforce their subpoenas in court if necessary. The measure also includes language to enable committee chairmen to enforce their subpoenas in court without a full vote on the House floor. Stay tuned for more... Donald Trump and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, appear to have violated the law by failing to document their meetings with Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and others, according to a lawsuit filed by a prominent government watchdog. The lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), National Security Archive (the Archive) and Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations (SHAFR), outlines several occasions in which the absence of note takers meant no official record was created of conversations between the president, members of his administration and foreign leaders. The failure to keep records, they contend, is in violation with the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act. Five such instances concerned meetings between Trump and Putin, while another involved a recent meeting between Kushner and top Saudi officials. The latter excluded officials from the State Department, prompting criticism from the agency. \"It is clear that President Trump and White House officials have gone to great lengths to hold high-level meetings with foreign governments and carry out foreign policy objectives while blatantly ignoring recordkeeping laws and preventing national security officials and the American people from understanding what they are doing,\" said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director at CREW, said. The absence of records in these circumstances causes real, incalculable harm to our national security and poses a direct threat to transparency for the American public. We're asking the court to compel White House officials to make and maintain these important records that let the public know what the government is up to and provide a safeguard to our history.\" A hearing is officially underway in the House judiciary committee to examine anti-competitive behavior among digital platforms, such as Google and Facebook, and its impact on news media. The hearing, which is part of a new antitrust investigation, comes amid growing scrutiny over the dominance of Big Tech and bipartisan push for new regulations. Lawmakers were set to hear from News Media Alliance, a trade organization representing 2,000 news outlets, among other media executives. Matthew Schruers, vice president of the tech trade group Computer and Communications Industry Association, will speak on behalf of the technology industry. David Cicilline, the chairman of the House judiciary antitrust subcommittee, opened the hearing with a focus on the enhanced market power of online platforms and subsequent threat to news publishers who have seen a dramatic fall in advertising revenues. \"Concentration in the digital advertising market has pushed local journalism to the verge of extinction,\" Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said in his opening remarks. \"The combination of predatory acquisitions, a growing innovation kill zone, and high network effects and switching costs appear to have undermined entrepreneurship and start-up rates.\" \"And the sheer dominance of some platforms has resulted in worse products and significantly less choice, leaving people without a competitive alternative to services that harvest their data, manipulate their behavior, and monetize their attention.\" A day before the hearing, the News Media Alliance released a study showing that Google earned an estimated $4.7b in 2018 from news publishers' content. News publishers' revenue from advertising has meanwhile rapidly declined and forced widespread layoffs in newsrooms across the US. According to the Pew Research Center, newsroom employment dropped 23% between 2008 and 2017. \"This journalism crisis is also a democracy crisis. As sources of trustworthy news disappear, American civic life suffers,\" Representative Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, said at the hearing. \"Today as the Internet becomes the dominant platform for accessing news, and as this platform grows more and more concentrated in the hands of just two major companies, news media once again faces serious threats, and congressional action may once again be required.\" Speaking of investigations, Donald Trump Jr is headed back to Capitol Hill... The Republican-led Senate intelligence committee subpoenaed Trump Jr last month, shocking the president and his allies. Trump Jr, who was coordinated the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower after being offered dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russians, testified before the panel in 2017. Special counsel Robert Mueller's report nonetheless revealed inconsistencies in what the president's eldest son told members of Congress about both conversations with his father regarding the Trump Tower meeting, and negotiations over a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow during the 2016 election. According to CNN, Trump Jr struck a deal with the Senate intelligence committee to privately testify on both of those topics, as well as others, for two-to-four hours on Wednesday. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler on Monday touted a deal with the Justice Department under which his panel could review some of the underlying evidence from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. But not so fast... The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday that Donald Trump's White House will work with the Justice Department to determine exactly what material House Democrats are able to see. Citing two senior administrations officials, the report also alluded to the prospect of the White House claiming executive privilege to limit access to Nadler's committee. The White House has aggressively fought efforts by congressional Democrats to obtain key documents and witnesses related to the Mueller investigation and the president's finances. Nadler's panel has meanwhile engaged in tense negotiations with the DOJ to see the full unredacted version of Mueller's report an underlying evidence. The deal reached on Monday would enable lawmakers to review at least a subset of those documents and showed the first signs of progress in weeks. It remains to be seen how the White House's role in the process might affect the agreement. Firing blanks? Donald Trump just pulled a piece of paper from his jacket's inside pocket while briefing the White House pool reporters, saying it's his deal with Mexico. \"That's the agreement that everybody says I don't have. I'm going to let Mexico do the announcement at the right time,\" he said. He then added: \"This is one page of a very long and very good agreement from Mexico and the United States. Without the tariffs, we would have had nothing.\" But one pool reporter questions whether what's really on the paper is.....nada. Trump said he's heard Joe Biden's a loser Reaching for one of his favorite insults ahead of flying to Iowa for some events today, the president throws \"loser\" in with a bunch of other brickbats for former vice-president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden. Speaking with White House pool reporters in the Oval Office less than an hour ago, Donald Trump said: \"I heard Biden was a loser. I mean look, Joe never got more than 1%. It looks like he's failing, it looks like his friends from the left are going to overtake him very soon.\" He adds a bit of explanation shortly afterwards, though not much. \"I call him 1% Joe because until Obama came along he didn't do very well.\" Biden was in Iowa earlier today holding a campaign event and calling Trump an \"existential threat\". He went on to excoriate the president at length. In this initial response, Trump then further told the pool: \"When a man has to mention my name 76 times in his speech, that means he's in trouble. He's a different guy. He acts different than he used to. He looks different than he used to.\" And...he's his preferred opponent. \"I'd rather run against, I think, Biden than anybody. I think he's the weakest mentally and I think Joe is weak mentally. The others have much more energy.\" Trump's off to Iowa now. Early afternoon summary Here are the main political news items so far today: Jon Stewart says the treatment by Congress of those made sick by working in and around the Ground Zero area of New York after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center is \"shameful\". House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, says impeaching Donald Trump is not off the table. But she's \"done\" with trading barbs with the president. Former environmental protection agency (EPA) administrators are sounding the alarm over the Trump administration's environment policies on everything from clean air and water to the climate crisis. Democratic 2020 contender Joe Biden has called Donald Trump an \"existential threat\" at a rally in Iowa. Trump is heading to the early-caucus state later today for a fund-raiser and other events. Jon Stewart has delivered a scathing rebuke of Congress and its handling of benefits for 9/11 first responders and victims, telling US lawmakers their inaction is \"an embarrassment to the country\". Stewart, who has been a forceful proponent of legislation providing federal funding for medical treatment for 9/11 survivors, testified on Tuesday alongside first responders and victims before the House judiciary committee. But only a handful of lawmakers appeared at the hearing, prompting a visibly angry Stewart to condemn their treatment of those who responded to and survived the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. \"As I sit here today, I can't help but think what an incredible metaphor this room is for the entire process that getting healthcare and benefits for 9/11 first responders has come to,\" Stewart said. \"Behind me, a filled rom of 9/11 first responders and in front of me a nearly empty Congress.\" He added: Shameful. It's an embarrassment to the country and it is a stain on this institution. You should be ashamed of yourselves, for those that aren't here, but you won't be. Because accountability doesn't appear to be something that occurs in this chamber.\" Earlier this year, the US government slashed payments by more than half to those who were sick and dying from the toxins released during the attacks after US officials said the 9/11 victims compensation fund was running out of money. Those who developed health issues or did not discover illnesses until a later stage saw even larger reductions in payouts for health benefits. More than 20,000 individuals have suffered or died from cancer, breathing problems and other ailments on account of the trauma inflicted on 9/11. Stewart told lawmakers it took only five seconds for first responders in New York to arrive at the scene of the terrorist attacks and that hundreds \"died in an instant\". \"There is not a person here, there is not an empty chair on that stage, that didn't tweet out 'never forget the heroes of 9/11',\" he said, quoting how members of Congress annually mark that day. \"Never forget their bravery, never forget what they did, what they gave to this country.\" Drawing attention once more to the lack of urgency among lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Stewart said: \"It would be one thing if their callous indifference and rank hypocrisy were benign, but it's not.\" Your indifference cost these men and women their most valuable commodity - time. It's the one thing they're running out of. This should be flipped. This hearing should be flipped. These men and women should be up on that stage, and Congress should be down here answering their questions as to why this is so hard and takes so damn long.\" Stewart, who often grew emotional in his remarks, has repeatedly traveled to Washington with 9/11 victims and first responders to lobby for legislation to codify the health benefits into law. Congress authorized $7.3b in 2015 to cover claims through the end of 2020, but funds have quickly been depleted across 20,000 people enrolled in the program. Data released by the 9/11 fund in January showed a 235% surge in death claims compared to the end of 2015. The number individuals suffering from cancer and filing eligible claims has also ballooned. \"Certainly 9/11 first responders shouldn't have to decide whether to live or to have a place to live,\" Stewart said. \"More of these men and women are going to get sick, and they are going to die.\" He also took aim at those who dismiss 9/11 funding as a 'New York issue', stating: Al-Qaeda didn't shout 'death to Tribeca'. They attacked America. And these men and women, and their response to it, is what brought our country back. It's what gave our reeling nation a solid foundation to stand back upon... And you are ignoring them.\" \"I'm sorry if I sound angry and undiplomatic, but I am angry and you should be too,\" added Stewart, who received a standing ovation at the conclusion of his statement. \"They responded in five seconds. They did their jobs [with] courage, grace, tenacity, humility. Eighteen years later, do yours.\" House speaker Nancy Pelosi did not rule out impeaching Donald Trump as Democrats continue to investigate the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller's report and whether the president is guilty of obstructing justice. \"It's not off the table,\" Pelosi, who has faced mounting pressure to launch a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, said at a fiscal summit in Washington on Tuesday. \"I don't think you should impeach for political reasons and I don't think you should not impeach for political reasons,\" she added. \"It's not about politics. It's not about Democrats and Republicans, it's not about partisanship.\" \"It's about patriotism to our country. It's upholding the constitution of the United States.\" Pelosi's comments came as a growing number of Democrats have called for impeachment proceedings amid efforts by the White House to stonewall their investigative measures. The Trump administration has instructed several key witnesses, including former White House counsel Don McGahn and Trump's former communications director Hope Hicks, not to testify before Congress. Pelosi has thus far pushed back against opening an impeachment inquiry at this stage, stating the issue is \"very divisive\" and could benefit Trump as he positions himself for re-election in 2020. At the same time, she has engaged in an escalating war of words with the president, questioning his fitness for office and calling for an intervention. Last week, Pelosi told Democrats behind closed doors she would rather see Trump \"in prison\" than impeached. Pelosi declined to address her private comments on Tuesday, stating: \"When we have conversations in our caucus, they stay in our caucus.\" She nonetheless signaled she was through trading barbs with Trump, telling the crowd: \"I'm done with him.\" \"I don't even want to talk about him,\" Pelosi said, adding: \"My stock goes up every time he attacks me, so what can I say, but let's not spend too much time on that because that's his victory, the diverter-in-chief, the diverter-of-attention-in-chief.\" Comedian Jon Stewart joins health experts and victims now to testify before the House judiciary committee on the lack of federal funding for the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, which was designed to ensure medical care to those impacted by the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Funding for the program, which covers more than 16,000 individuals across the US, is running out of money and has had to dramatically slash benefits to first responders and survivors. Stewart has been a vocal advocate of legislation to provide funding for 9/11 victims and routinely lobbied lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The House judiciary is committee is poised to vote Wednesday on reauthorizing the program. Watch live here and stay tuned for more. A host of former Environmental Protection Agency administrators -- Gina McCarthy, Christine Todd Whitman, William Reilly, and Lee Thomas -- are testifying before House energy subcommittee on environmental policy under Donald Trump. The Guardian's Emily Holden has the latest: Former leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency--including three Republicans and one Democrat--are warning lawmakers that the Trump administration's rollbacks of key pollution safeguards are putting Americans at risk. The Obama administration's EPA chief, Gina McCarthy, plans to tell a House subcommittee today that she finds it \"disconcerting\" that four past administrators \"feel obligated to testify together and individually to make the case that what is happening at EPA today is simply put, not normal.\" Trump has shrunk staff and begun to rescind rules for cleaner electricity, vehicle fuel efficiency and waterway protections. The administration is refusing any action to slow the climate crisis, with Trump denying the science showing humans are heating the planet. EPA has relaxed enforcement of environmental laws, with top officials saying they want to work with industry. A number of top EPA appointees previously represented the groups they now regulate. Seven former EPA leaders in April urged the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to conduct more oversight of the agency. \"With every passing day, EPA seems to be losing valuable career staff while agency leadership has been on a seemingly unstoppable crusade to rollback rules with seemingly little regard to the health impacts of their rollbacks,\" McCarthy said. Christine Todd Whitman, EPA chief under Republican president George W. Bush, will testify that \"today, as never before, the mission of EPA is being seriously undermined by the very people who have been entrusted with carrying that mission out.\" \"We are here because we are deeply concerned that decades of environmental progress are at risk of being lost,\" she said. Well, Donald Trump is tweeting again... (not that he ever stopped). The president took to his favorite social media platform on Tuesday to refer to the Russia investigation as \"the Greatest Witch Hunt of all time\" and once again suggest, falsely, that he had been exonerated by special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Quoting his close ally, South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, Trump tweeted: He then closed his morning thread with an all-caps: \"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\" House Democrats have been pursuing the full, unredacted Mueller report as they weigh a formal impeachment inquiry against the president. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has thus far resisted calls from within her caucus to launch impeachment proceedings, stating such a move would be politically divisive and play directly into Trump's hands. On Monday, House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler announced a deal with the Justice Department under which Democrats will be given access to a subset of documents pertaining to the underlying evidence Mueller used to draw up his report. The agreement was the first thaw in weeks of contentious negotiations between the two sides over what material Democrats would be allowed to review. Nadler's committee voted last month to hold attorney general William Barr in contempt of Congress after he declined to comply with a subpoena for the full Mueller report. The full House will vote on Tuesday on the contempt resolution, which also aims to hold former White House counsel Don McGahn accountable for refusing to testify before Congress despite receiving a subpoena of his own. Following the Justice Department's decision to hand over certain documents related to Mueller's investigation, Nadler said he would not enforce the contempt resolution against Barr but signaled he may go back to it if the documents were insufficient. You can read my explainer on what the whole contempt fight means here. Vice president Mike Pence has defended the Trump administration's move to bar US embassies from flying the rainbow pride flag during LBGTQ pride month as \"the right decision\". \"We're proud to be able to serve every American,\" Pence said in an interview with NBC News late Monday. \"But when it comes to the American flagpole, and American embassies, and capitals around the world, one American flag flies.\" The Guardian's Oliver Milman has more: At least four US embassies - in Israel, Germany, Brazil and Latvia - were denied permission to fly the pride flag. Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Germany, is spearheading an American campaign to decriminalize homosexuality around the world and said he would be \"proud\" to fly the rainbow flag. But Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, believes that embassy flagpoles should be reserved for the American flag only, according to a spokeswoman. \"Pride Month, that we're in right now, is celebrated around the world by many State Department employees, by many embassies,\" Morgan Ortagus, the state department spokeswoman, said on Monday. \"The secretary has the position that, as it relates to the flag pole, that only the American flag should be flown there.\" Read the full report here. Good morning everyone! Sabrina Siddiqui here, manning the live blog and taking you through the latest in US politics. I'll be giving you updates on two congressional hearings today: One will feature first responders and students, along with comedian Jon Stewart, testifying before lawmakers on the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. The government fund providing health benefits to those sickened by the attacks has nearly run dry, and victims will implore Congress to expand it. Big Tech will also be under scrutiny at a hearing examining anti-competitive behavior among digital giants -- namely Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. Last week, House speaker Nancy Pelosi warned tech titans: \"The era of self-regulation is over\". And then there will surely be news from a certain Donald Trump, who you may have heard of, so stay tuned! Joe Biden and Donald Trump will hold dueling rallies in the key battleground state of Iowa, offering Americans a preview of what a hypothetical 2020 general election might hold in store. According to CBS News, Biden plans to call Trump an \"existential threat\" to the United States as he seeks to position himself as the best Democratic contender to take on the president at the ballot box. The former vice president plans to draw a \"sharp contrast\" on issues such as climate change, tariffs and American values. Biden launched his campaign in April with a laser focus on the general election, touting himself as the most likely candidate to defeat Trump while lamenting the trajectory of the country under the president's stewardship. Biden will expand upon the theme on Tuesday, telling Iowans: \"What are you going to do when your kids start tweeting like Trump and say, 'Well, the president did it.'\" Trump will meanwhile travel to western Iowa on Tuesday to deliver remarks on renewable energy before heading to Des Moines for a dinner and fundraiser with the state's Republican Party. Trump has repeatedly attacked Biden, calling him \"another low I.Q. individual\" and hitting his record on trade and crime. 33742 false false  Vivian Ho in San Francisco (now) and Sabrina Siddiqui in Washington (earlier)      The House rules committee chairman, Jim McGovern, prepares for the House to vote to authorize contempt cases against William Barr and Don McGahn.

I'm John Vause and you're watching CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: The United States fault lines on race, ethnicity and political ideology were on full display Tuesday on Capitol Hill. The U.S. House voted to condemn Donald Trump's racist language aimed at four Democratic lawmakers, all women of color.</p><p>The debate was contentious. Republicans insist the president is not racist and at one point White House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was barred from speaking for violating decorum by calling the president's language racist.</p><p>Eventually the vote fell mostly along party lines with the resolution saying it strongly condemns Trump's racist comments that have legitimized an increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by saying that our fellow Americans who are immigrants and those who may look to the president like immigrants should go back to other countries.</p><p>Michael Genovese is the president of the Global Policy Institute at Loyola Marymount University and he joins us from Los Angeles. Michael, quite a day.</p><p>MICHAEL GENOVESE, POLITICAL ANALYST: What a day indeed and the fault lines were drawn. The original sin of the United States, racism and slavery, we still haven't solved them. We still haven't settled that dispute and healed those wounds.</p><p>You can see them coming back today in manifest form. The president to the United States, it's unquestionably venomous racism. He tried to not walk away from those comments. He walked towards them, he marched forward, defended his comments, doubled down and the Republican Party was put in a terrible position.</p><p>If you are with the president, you either accept or embrace racism. If you go against him you're running a political risk. And, yet, the answer I think is, what you will tell your children, that you defended racism or you stood up against racism?</p><p>VAUSE: It's been more than 100 years since Congress has taken this type of measure against a sitting president. At the end of the day, like everything else, it came down to a vote along party lines.</p><p>Here's Trump's housing secretary during a cabinet meeting, justifying his support for Donald Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BEN CARSON, HUD SECRETARY: Would you rather have a non-politician whose speech is unfiltered, who gets a lot of stuff done or somebody with a silver tongue that gets nothing done?</p><p>But as I've told you before, I think God is using him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: So the president is doing God's work; four Republicans did vote with Democrats, so, too, an independent and former Republican, Justin Amash.</p><p>But it does beg the question, what does this president have to do before he is held accountable by members of his own party?</p><p>GENOVESE: The members of his party are in a difficult position because politically he'd still controls a segment of that party and they're scared to death that they will be either primaried out or their support will be withdrawn and the Democrat will win.</p><p>But the president's comments were odious and for decades. White nationalists, the Ku Klux Klan, have been trying to spread their venomous hatred. They found a champion in the president and that the Republicans have not stood up to him is a cheapening of the soul of the party.</p><p>They've sold their soul for pennies, for the 30 pieces of silver. And I think what's happening is the Republican Party is putting themselves in a position, where they have no out on this. They either join the president or they're on the outs. So he has put his fellow Republicans in a terrible spot.</p><p>VAUSE: He celebrated, he tweeted a short time ago, \"So great to see how unified the Republican Party was on today's vote concerning statements I made about four Democrat congresswomen, 187 to 4 at the end. Wow.\"</p><p>Does it come a point, where a price is paid by the GOP, maybe not in the next couple of years but beyond 2020, when the Republican Party lawmakers and this loyalty to this president and everything he has done and everything he stands for will cost them?</p><p>And what will that cost me?</p><p>GENOVESE: With gerrymandering, there are so many safe seats that a number of Republicans know that they can say anything and support the president who does anything and they will still be electorally viable and OK. But that's not the point, the point is --</p><p>[00:05:00]</p><p>GENOVESE: -- can you have a party post-Trump that goes through this and comes out the other end as the party of racism, the party of bigotry, the party of hatred, the party that turns its back on many Americans and turns its back on the moral and ethical values that we're trying to live up to?</p><p>If there is a distinction, it's a partisan distinction of tribalism and that tribalism can be toxic. And this is a case when sometimes you just have to break out of that toxic mix. You have to say to yourself, it's not worth it for me to go down that road. I have to have and maintain some integrity. My party has to maintain some integrity and we have to get beyond Trump and move away from Trump.</p><p>VAUSE: Earlier today, the president was defending his initial comments. He tweeted this out, \"Those tweets are not racist. I don't have a racist bone in my body. Given the horrible things they have said\" -- this refers to the four Democratic lawmakers, the four women -- \"Omar is polling at 8 percent, Cortez at 21 percent. Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away but now they are forever wedded to the Democratic Party. See you in 2020.\"</p><p>Is it possible that all of this controversy, the hateful language, the national rift which is being exposed and deepened is for nothing more than to give Trump an edge in 2020 by motivating his base?</p><p>GENOVESE: It's clear that there's kind of a three-H club style of campaigning in 2020 for Trump. The three H's ages are hope -- the economy is going well, I can make a good case for that.</p><p>The second H is here -- I'm the incumbent and I'm here and I've certain tools that I can use.</p><p>And the third is hate. His base response to hatred. His base responds -- and the president's strategy is I can win with 40 some-odd percent because what I will do is I'll make sure that every one of those in my base gets out to vote and I'll try to attack my opponent. Look at the strategy, they're racist, they're the communists, they're the socialists. They're making America. As long as he can tear down -- and he tears down very well; he cannot build up. And so he strategy has to be to tear down the Democrats on this issue and to build up his base by saying we are OK, they are the ones who are out to get us.</p><p>VAUSE: The message from the president to these four congresswoman, in fact, everyone, it seems, seems like that old bumper sticker you'd see usually on a Buick somewhere or a Cadillac, USA, love it or leave it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think it's terrible when people speak so badly about our country and people speak so horribly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Here's the problem.</p><p>Who decides what's horrible and what's bad and what is fair and reasonable criticism?</p><p>This next sound bite, is it fair and reasonable criticism or horrible?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The United States has become the laughing stock and a whipping post for the rest of the world.</p><p>The country is doing horribly, to put it mildly.</p><p>We don't win anymore. We don't win with our military, we don't win with health care. We don't win with anything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: So if this is horrible criticism that gentleman just made, is there an idea that he should go back to where his grandfather came from, which is Germany, because he doesn't love it here?</p><p>GENOVESE: There's not an argument for that. That's playing Donald Trump's game and we should not sink into that gutter. It's tempting and it's hard not to be snarky when he is so snarky.</p><p>But you've made the comment about the love it or leave it and that came from the 1960s. In the 1960s, I'm old enough to have been part of the antiwar movement, we had a chance. The whole world is watching. We wanted to focus the attention on the war in Vietnam and say judge us by this, by our opposition to that war, by the values that we're trying to bring to America.</p><p>The same thing is happening today. The whole world is watching, we are seeing an America that is led by and out and out racist and there is no defense, no claim that he's not.

I think we need to stand up and say that we are not that country, we are not the country that hates people because of their color or because where they came from and because of the God to whom they pray.</p><p>This is a defining moment for America.

If we are united on the inside, nobody will divide us from the outside.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Von der Leyen was perhaps not the obvious choice to be the first female to lead the E.U.

I was really impressed with the depth that they went to and regulation and how laws are handled and passwords are handled interoperability between other wallets and allowing third parties to build a platform, how that information is shared and plus how it plugs into larger things like anti money laundering issues.</p><p>So I gave Congress massive kudos on this whole thing and hopefully striking a little fear in Facebook to think about how their past activities are s bringing in distrust for this new endeavor.</p><p>VAUSE: To be fair, the Libra thing was (INAUDIBLE) muddy the waters a little bit. They didn't know what their regulation should be or whether they should break it up. Different senators had different opinions on what they should do.</p><p>But the day began with the president tweeting about Google in terms of treason. \"Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel believes Google should be investigated for treason.

He has a vested interest in Google's downfall because --</p><p>[00:25:00]</p><p>PERRY: -- he does have a competing product in the form of Palantir, who provides big data to the governments, so, of course, he's going to stoke the fire and say, what's going on at Google because he wants more contracts.

What you see on Facebook and Google is based on what you already consume but they're only bringing more of what you see already. So there are theories that they may be dampening access to information for things that might be not so Left but is there a way to prove that?</p><p>I don't know.</p><p>How do you look under the hood?</p><p>I really don't know. But I will give John Kennedy kudos for calling B.S. on this stuff because in there, there is a kernel of truth about, all right, can we really trust you guys on to deliver what we expect to be the news?</p><p>VAUSE: Well, they continue to say that they are not a news organization and walk away from any responsibility when it comes to journalism.

Quick Fix    \u2014 Silicon Valley-Capitol Hill showdown:  In one of the most highly-anticipated tech hearings in decades, the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are (finally) testifying today before House lawmakers on allegations that the giants are unfairly quashing competition.   \u2014 MT exclusive:  House Judiciary rejected Republicans\u2019 requests to hold today's hearing at the full committee level, but former ranking member Doug Collins (R-Ga.) is giving that demand another go just hours before the curtain comes up.   \u2014 Elsewhere in the House: Appropriations lawmakers are locking in floor votes on tech amendments around artificial intelligence and broadband \u2014 but the proposed amendments on facial recognition and telehealth didn\u2019t make the cut.

Tech of the Town    TODAY\u2019S THE DAY: SILICON VALLEY CEOS COLLIDE WITH CONGRESS \u2014 When the clock strikes noon, House Judiciary lawmakers in the antitrust subcommittee will kick off the long-awaited, hotly-watched tech competition hearing \u2014 the first joint, congressional appearance by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai. What questions do you have heading into today\u2019s blockbuster session, and what do you want us to recap on Thursday? Let us know .   \u2014 What Jeff Bezos will say: That Amazon makes up but a small percentage of global retail \u2014 just 1 percent worldwide and 4 percent in the U.S. \u2014 and that its marketplace helps smaller businesses reach more customers and more easily store and ship goods. \u201cJust like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones,\u201d Bezos plans to tell the panel today . \u201cThere are things small companies simply can\u2019t do. I don\u2019t care how good an entrepreneur you are, you\u2019re not going to build an all-fiber Boeing 787 in your garage.\u201d             \u2014 Why Bezos may face the most heat: As Leah reports this morning, Amazon has the most to lose. \u201cAmazon has spent years watching \u2014 or even prodding \u2014 from the sidelines as regulators in the U.S. and Europe went after America\u2019s other powerful tech companies,\u201d she writes. But worldwide scrutiny of Amazon has accelerated in the past year. Even more than the other businesses in Wednesday's spotlight, Bezos\u2019 company influences what and where people buy food and other essentials; the news, books and websites they read; the television and movies they watch; the advertising they see online. Amazon is the country's second largest private employer with 590,000 workers, and a leader in cloud computing and next-generation technologies including artificial intelligence, drones and self-driving cars.   \u2014 What Mark Zuckerberg will say: That Facebook needs to step up its game on misinformation, voter suppression and hateful content. \u201cI understand the concerns people have in these areas, and we are working to address them,\u201d Zuck plans to say in prepared opening remarks, per a copy obtained early by POLITICO . \"While we are making progress \u2014 for example, we have dramatically improved our ability to proactively find and remove harmful content and prevent election interference \u2014 I recognize that we have more to do.\u201d   \u2014 What Sundar Pichai will say: That Google\u2019s search engine isn\u2019t the only way to get information anymore. \u201cYou can ask Alexa a question from your kitchen; read your news on Twitter; ask friends for information via WhatsApp; and get recommendations on Snapchat or Pinterest. When searching for products online, you may be visiting Amazon, eBay, Walmart, or any one of a number of e-commerce providers where most online shopping queries happen,\u201d the Google CEO says in his written remarks . Likewise, the advertising market \u2014 another area where the Mountain View company faces monopolization allegations \u2014 has \u201can enormous amount of choice,\u201d Pichai says, citing competition from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and Comcast.   \u2014 What Tim Cook will say: That Apple isn\u2019t dominant and its App Store offers curation and fair fees. \u201cThe App Store guidelines ensure a high-quality, reliable and secure user experience,\u201d Cook says in his prepared testimony . \u201cThey are transparent and applied equally to developers of all sizes and in all categories.\u201d The Apple CEO says the App Store has charged the same amount for the past decade, and its fees are cheaper than what developers used to pay to distribute software, he says. \u201cScrutiny is reasonable and appropriate. We approach this process with respect and humility. But we make no concession on the facts.\u201d   \u2014 How Democrats are looking at the hearing: Officials are hoping to keep the hearing from straying too far off course. \u201cDemocratic lawmakers and senior House Judiciary aides say they expect Wednesday's session to have a needle-like focus on the competitive concerns posed by the companies, the central premise of the hearing,\u201d Cristiano reports . \u201cTo do that, lawmakers will need to pepper all four chief executives with exacting questions.\u201d   Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a member of the subcommittee, said one strategy lawmakers plan to take today is to focus on issues that cut across the tech giants, like their ability to box out competitors with the vast troves of consumer data they collect, Cristiano reports . Another, she said, is their ability to deploy \"copy, acquire, kill\" strategies to duplicate, buy out or otherwise neutralize budding rivals.   \u2014 How Republicans are looking at the hearing: Funny you asked. See just below.   MT EXCLUSIVE: GOP HEARING PUSHBACK CONTINUES INTO ELEVENTH HOUR \u2014 House Judiciary declined GOP requests to hold today's hearing at the full committee level ( much to Republicans\u2019 chagrin ), but hey, it\u2019s never too late to try just one more time. Former House Judiciary ranking member Collins, who helped launch the antitrust probe in 2019, sent a letter this morning to Chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) and antitrust Chair Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) pushing them to hold the session with the full committee (or at the very least, to allow the Georgia Republican to pose questions).   \u2014 \u201cWe have seen companies like Twitter and Google abuse their market power to effectively censor the voices of those they disagree with \u2013 namely conservatives,\u201d Collins wrote in the letter . \u201cIt is vital that we restore the credibility of the Committee\u2019s investigation into Big Tech\u2019s anti-competitive and anti-free speech actions, and the only way to do that is to allow all Committee Members a seat at the table and an opportunity to question the CEOs responsible for these decisions.\u201d Watch out for more shenanigans today.   TECH QUOTE DU JOUR, VIA DOJ\u2019S MUSIC LICENSING WORKSHOP \u2014 \u201cIt is crazy to think that in 2020 songwriters are more regulated than Facebook,\" said American Society of Composers, Authors &amp; Publishers CEO Elizabeth Matthews.         FULL HOUSE TO VOTE ON AI, BROADBAND AMENDMENTS  \u2014 As House lawmakers gear up to vote at the end of the week on their fiscal year 2021 funding package for the FCC, FTC and Commerce Department, they\u2019re planning floor votes on multiple tech amendments: a provision from Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) to boost funding for the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence as well as an amendment from Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), a former FCC staffer, to up FCC broadband infrastructure grant money by $1 million.   \u2014 This overall approps package itself would include more than $60 billion in emergency broadband funds and a rider from Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.) to block FCC and FTC implementation of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order to crack down on tech companies .   \u2014 Among filed amendments not receiving floor votes: A bid from Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) to give the FCC another $200 million for its Covid-19 Telehealth Program (an idea receiving bipartisan backing despite bipartisan questions about the initial FCC effort) as well as multiple amendments aimed at curbing the use of facial recognition technology.   INNOVATORS, START YOUR ENGINES \u2014 Tuesday marked the launch of a worldwide competition to find the top Covid-19 rapid testing solutions, I write in POLITICO\u2019s latest issue of Future Pulse , a new newsletter focused on the intersection between tech and health care. The contest comes as the United States remains in the midst of a screening crisis \u2014 without enough testing to safely reopen the country \u2014 and as the timeline to a vaccine remains uncertain.   \u2014 The goal now , according to Xprize, the organization leading the global faceoff, is to make testing \u201cfrequent, fast, cheap [and] easy.\u201d The contest, which will last for six months, aims to find a system that can turn around results in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks ; collects samples easily and painlessly; and costs less than $15 per test.   \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom threw his weight behind the competition this week , and Google and Amazon are among its roughly 20 partners across health care and tech. Entrepreneurs, scientists and other competitors can register here , through August 31, in the following categories: At Home, Point-of-Care, Distributed Lab, or High-Throughput Lab.    Transitions    Patrick Wilson , who previously held a senior role in the Commerce Department, is joining the semiconductor company MediaTek as vice president of government affairs for the U.S. \u2026 Taylor Owings  will serve as acting chief of staff and senior counsel of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, replacing outgoing chief of staff William Rinner . \u2026 Josh Richards , Griffin Johnson and Noah Beck have joined TikTok rival Triller: Richards as an investor and the company\u2019s chief strategy officer, and Johnson and Beck as advisors and equity shareholders. \u2026 The Financial Data and Technology Association of North America added Equitable Bank and Xero as new members.     Silicon Valley Must Reads    #StopHateForProfit, in review: \u201cThe widely publicized advertiser boycott against Facebook has less than a week to show it has become a global coalition solid enough, and strong enough, to take on the social media giant,\u201d POLITICO reports. \u201cThe month is almost over without Facebook meeting many of their demands. If the movement can\u2019t up the ante, it risks watching its work evaporate.\u201d   ICYMI: Twitter restricted Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s account after determining the president\u2019s eldest son violated its policies against spreading misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, POLITICO reports .

Axios understands[2] the Judiciary Committee has asked Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook to say if their CEOs will testify for the antitrust probe in July. The companies reportedly have until June 14th to answer. </p><p>However, they might not have a choice regardless of their responses \u2014 the letters hint at possible subpoenas for testimony and relevant documents if the CEOs don't volunteer.In statement, committee chair David Cicilline said the documents (which include responses to other probes) were 'essential' to the investigation and that requests like this were part of the 'appropriate process' to obtain the files. While major tech CEOs have testified for Congress[3] in the past, their appearances aren't guaranteed. Companies have sometimes chosen to send other executives instead, and Amazon has so far declined to commit[4] to testimony from Jeff Bezos in another investigation. That's not including concerns about the ongoing pandemic, either. If they do agree, though, July could prove a pivotal month as politicians seek to keep tech giants in check.  In this article: politics[5], Apple[6], Amazon[7], alphabet[8], Google[9], Facebook[10], House of Representatives[11], Congress[12], antitrust[13], Competition[14], regulation[15], internet[16], news[17], gear[18] All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right.

Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad?

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. The Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow at 10 o'clock got some great guests. Somebody named Emily Compagno, got the comedian Kris Fried, Emily Compagno and Kat Timpf and Tyrus and Emily Compagno. Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad? We'll see you back here on Monday, though. Have a great weekend, everybody from THE FIVE.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2224437357</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC3-2RD1-JBHT-D3SY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. The Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow at 10 o'clock got some great guests. Somebody named Emily Compagno, got the comedian Kris Fried, Emily Compagno and Kat Timpf and Tyrus and Emily Compagno. Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship.

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO: After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD: Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO: Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO: I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO: But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST: Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS: Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO: Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS: No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD: We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS: The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS: This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO: Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS: Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO: OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD: You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY: We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD: Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO: And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO: Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO: But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO: I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS: If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS: They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no.</p><p>WATTERS: Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD: We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>COMPAGNO: James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR: The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY: It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER: So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY: I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER: Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY: Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER: Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY: I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO: President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Right.</p><p>WATTERS: He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO: So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO: -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO: A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD: You like it.</p><p>WATTERS: I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD: And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS: Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No.</p><p>WATTERS: If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS: That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD: We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS: If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS: And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO: Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>PERINO: Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO: All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK: The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO: You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO: Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS: Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right.</p><p>PERINO: By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO: Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO: Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence - - screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. The Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow at 10 o'clock got some great guests. Somebody named Emily Compagno, got the comedian Kris Fried, Emily Compagno and Kat Timpf and Tyrus and Emily Compagno. Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad? We'll see you back here on Monday, though. Have a great weekend, everybody from THE FIVE.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019051001cb258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W35-J751-DXH2-64WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0008WWO</classCode><className>BARR PHARMACEUTICALS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. The Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow at 10 o'clock got some great guests. Somebody named Emily Compagno, got the comedian Kris Fried, Emily Compagno and Kat Timpf and Tyrus and Emily Compagno. Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad? We'll see you back here on Monday, though. Have a great weekend, everybody from THE FIVE.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2224438077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-DDH1-DY0W-4125-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. The Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow at 10 o'clock got some great guests. Somebody named Emily Compagno, got the comedian Kris Fried, Emily Compagno and Kat Timpf and Tyrus and Emily Compagno. Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad? We'll see you back here on Monday, though. Have a great weekend, everybody from THE FIVE.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2224438077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-09R1-JBHT-D16R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. The Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow at 10 o'clock got some great guests. Somebody named Emily Compagno, got the comedian Kris Fried, Emily Compagno and Kat Timpf and Tyrus and Emily Compagno. Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship.

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. The Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow at 10 o'clock got some great guests. Somebody named Emily Compagno, got the comedian Kris Fried, Emily Compagno and Kat Timpf and Tyrus and Emily Compagno. Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad? We'll see you back here on Monday, though. Have a great weekend, everybody from THE FIVE.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2224438077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8B-G9V1-DY0W-44CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right.

Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad?

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. The Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow at 10 o'clock got some great guests. Somebody named Emily Compagno, got the comedian Kris Fried, Emily Compagno and Kat Timpf and Tyrus and Emily Compagno. Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad? We'll see you back here on Monday, though. Have a great weekend, everybody from THE FIVE.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2224438077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W58-13T1-JBHT-D3H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right.

Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously.

So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad? We'll see you back here on Monday, though.
