Sandberg was slated to chat with the state officials about corporate citizenship in the digital age during a private morning session that Facebook had organized at the downtown Hilton Hotel in June 2018. She had a meet-and-greet with Utah's attorney general, Sean Reyes, who had been considered the year before for the chairmanship of the Federal Trade Commission. Later, in another Facebook-organized meeting, Sandberg and other company managers talked about digital privacy with the state legal chiefs. The meetings took place three months after reports that Facebook had allowed the harvesting of personal data of millions of users without their permission, in what became known as the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Federal and state lawmakers were escalating pressure on the company over the data breach as well as its dominance of the social-media market. </p><p>The FTC and several state attorneys general had opened investigations. According to emails reviewed by Bloomberg, the sessions with Sandberg during the National Association of Attorneys General summer meeting were just one day in a multiyear outreach program aimed at state prosecutors. Hundreds of emails were sent between company executives and state officials from 2017 to 2019, a sample of which were seen by Bloomberg. The emails were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by the Tech Transparency Project, which is part of the Campaign for Accountability, a political watchdog group. The emails show how Facebook went to great lengths to develop friendly relationships with powerful state prosecutors who could use their investigative and enforcement powers in ways that could harm Facebook's revenue growth. In the end, the company's charm offensive met with mixed results: Most of those attorneys general are now investigating the company for possible antitrust violations. Facebook isn't unique among large companies in establishing contact with state attorneys general, and the Campaign for Accountability doesn't allege wrongdoing by the social-media giant. \"Attorneys general have massive jurisdiction over businesses and virtually everything they do,\" said James Tierney, who served as Maine's attorney general for a decade. \"Every major industry should develop an understanding of attorneys general and reach out to them.\" The state-level campaign played out as the company was also expanding its Washington presence to deal with allegations beyond antitrust and privacy, including that foreign interests had exploited its platform to interfere in elections. Over the last few years, the company has broken its own federal lobbying records, reconfigured the leadership of its policy shop, and brought Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to Washington to woo critics, including for meetings with President Donald Trump, who has accused the company of suppressing right-leaning perspectives. The Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit that has investigated technology companies, politicians and abortion-rights opponents, among others, obtained the emails from the AGs' offices. Its executive director, Daniel Stevens, declined to name donors to the organization other than to say that they aren't corporations and include the New Venture Fund, a public-interest philanthropy. Stevens' group is also part of Freedom From Facebook &amp;amp; Google, an anti-big-tech coalition that counts Public Citizen and the Communications Workers of America as members. Facebook said the company has long-standing relationships with state AGs to collaborate on initiatives to keep the internet safe. \"The country's attorneys general take online safety seriously and so do we,\" said Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president of state and local public policy. \"That's why for many years we have taken every measure to help them in protecting people and being the best partners we can be.\" Facebook has worked with state prosecutors to promote online safety under a program that dates back to 2013. A Facebook spokesman said it's continuing to work with state attorneys general on responding to the spread of covid-19 and other issues. Allison Gilmore, the chief communications officer for the AGs' association, confirmed that Facebook held a meeting at the same Hilton Hotel in June 2018, but said it wasn't coordinated by the association, which doesn't accept money from corporations to host events. \"It is fairly common for outside organizations to schedule their own meetings adjacent to NAAG events, since more attorneys general are likely to be in attendance and available,\" Gilmore said in a statement. While state attorneys general are law enforcement officials, they are also politicians and many see the post as a steppingstone to higher office. Corporate lobbyists often donate to their campaigns and schmooze with them at legal conferences, while also pressing their case on state regulatory issues. The emails show that Facebook offered to produce, distribute and promote public service messages for the state prosecutors. It hosted high-level meetings between the AGs and company executives. It also donated to the state prosecutors' political campaigns and at times worked through them to craft state laws that might affect the company's practices. Attorneys general looking to promote their ideas or accomplishments couldn't do much better than Facebook's offer of access to its platform. It has 1.7 billion daily users and can micro-target individuals by location and demographics. An Amazon.com spokeswoman said the company often works with state AGs on consumer protection issues such as privacy and price gouging, but said she isn't aware it offers them any advertising discounts. The spokeswoman for the AGs' association said she isn't aware of any event hosting or filming of public-service ads by other large tech companies. Facebook and its employees, including Sandberg, donated more than $237,315 to various attorney general campaigns between 2014 and 2020, according to FollowTheMoney.org, which tracks political contributions at the state and local level. Microsoft Corp. and its employees gave $128,192 to attorneys general, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and its employees gave $120,686 and Amazon gave $43,945 in the same period, according to the campaign finance-tracking group. Facebook has also given nearly $579,000 to the Democratic and Republican associations of attorneys general between 2014 and 2018, according to the Center for Responsive Politics' database, which goes up to 2018. Google and Microsoft gave slightly smaller amounts in the same period. Spokespeople for Microsoft, Google and Amazon declined to comment on their donations. During the NAAG meeting in Portland, Facebook provided a top official as a speaker, according to the agenda. Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, joined a panel to discuss social media companies' use of consumer data, along with former Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen and a lobbyist for a technology trade group. In the private meeting later that day, in addition to Sandberg, Egan, former general counsel Colin Stretch and Castleberry also planned to be present, according to an email from Castleberry to Reyes, the Utah attorney general. They discussed \"the specifics of CA,\" an apparent reference to Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm with ties to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign that obtained the Facebook data. Alan Crooks, a political consultant for Utah's attorney general, confirmed that Reyes met with Sandberg at the conference, but said the relationship with Facebook began years before. The social media giant had provided financial backing and expertise to a task force on internet crimes against children that the Utah attorney general and others were involved in. Facebook donated $25,000 to Reyes' campaigns between 2014 and 2020, according to FollowTheMoney.org. In the same period, Microsoft gave Reyes $9,209, Amazon contributed $5,000 and Google $2,500. \"Facebook has been a tremendous corporate partner\" but it doesn't get any special consideration in return for its help, Reyes said in a statement. \"It is no secret that my office and other state AGs are currently investigating Facebook.\" Reyes was potentially a well-placed ally for Facebook. In early 2017, Trump's transition team included his name on its shortlist for FTC chairman, where he would have overseen both privacy and antitrust as one of Facebook's most important regulators. The position went to Joe Simons, its current chairman. Facebook's outreach helped it secure a key win in Vermont. In May 2019, an outside lobbyist for Facebook sent an email to Vermont Assistant Attorney General Ryan Kriger and State Rep. Michael Marcotte, who were collaborating on the drafting of a new data-privacy bill. The lobbyist asked them to delay a vote on the bill so that Facebook could propose modifications. Kriger and Marcotte agreed to the delay, the emails show. Marcotte said it's not unusual for lawmakers to delay a vote to seek input from organizations that have a stake in the outcome. \"It was just to make it crystal clear what could be done and what can't be done,\" Marcotte said. During deliberations on the bill, Facebook asked to add language that ensures that companies could still use students' information for marketing purposes as long as it wasn't identifiable, according to Marcotte. While some lawmakers thought the added language was redundant, it eventually made it into a bill that became law in March, Marcotte said. Facebook donated a total of $8,580 to the campaigns of Vermont Attorney General Thomas Donovan between 2014 and 2020, according to FollowTheMoney.org. His office didn't respond to requests for comment. In the same period, Google gave Donovan $4,000 and Microsoft gave $2,500. In February 2018, the emails show, Reyes and three other attorneys general encouraged their colleagues to participate in a video urging citizens to report suspected trafficking cases to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. \"Our partners at Facebook are providing the production and distribution of a human trafficking awareness PSA, to be distributed via Facebook users beginning March 30,\" the attorneys general wrote. The PSAs were filmed at an NAAG event and developed in conjunction with Thorn, an anti-human trafficking organization founded by actors Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore. At the time, Congress was pushing forward with a measure to narrow liability protections for websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. Tech companies, including Facebook, initially opposed the legislation because it weakened the much-loved Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet platforms from lawsuits over content posted by third parties. The ads allowed Facebook to show it could fight sex trafficking without having to change the liability shield. But after a barrage of criticism, Facebook changed course and supported the legislation. Trump signed the bill into law in April 2018. In a January 2017 email, Castleberry thanked Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden's office for participating in a video that encouraged consumers and organizations to maintain internet privacy and safety practices as part of an industry-backed public awareness campaign. He also sent instructions on how to use a \"$3,000 coupon code,\" so Wasden could advertise the video to constituents on Facebook without having to pay Facebook's normal advertising rate. A spokesman confirmed that Wasden participated in the video, but said that his office didn't use the promotional credit. Sandberg has donated $4,700 to AG campaigns between 2014 and 2020, according to FollowTheMoney.org. That doesn't include $5,000 to Letitia James in her successful campaign for New York attorney general in 2018. The money was later returned, and James is now leading an antitrust investigation of Facebook, joined by 46 other AGs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook., at the Bloomberg Year Ahead Summit in New York on Nov. 7, 2019.

It is unclear how long the process will take, though it is likely to be approved.</p><p>For many companies, a $5 billion fine would be crippling. But Facebookis not most companies. Last year its revenue wasnearly $56 billion. This year, analysts expect around $69 billion, according to Zacks.</p><p>As a one-time expense, the company will also be able to exclude the amount from its adjusted earnings results the profit figure that investors and financial analysts pay attention to.</p><p>\"This closes a dark chapter and puts it in the rearview mirror with Cambridge Analytica,\" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. \"Investors still had lingering worries that the fine might not be approved. Now, the Street can breathe a little easier.\"</p><p>Facebook prepared for a much bigger fine</p><p>Facebook was well prepared for the punishment. In April it said it was anticipating having to pay up to $5 billion.</p><p>So the news that it was no more than that came as something as a relief for the company and its shareholders. Shares in Facebook gained 24 cents after a few hours, closingat $204.87 on Friday. The stock is up more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year. In fact, Facebook's market value has increased by $64 billion since its April earnings report when it announced how much it was expecting to be fined.</p><p>\"Has there really been a $5 billion fine?\" tweeted French cybersecurity expert Matthieu Garin.</p><p>Several members of Congress are opposed tothesettlement.</p><p>\"The reported $5 billion penalty is barely a tap on the wrist, not even a slap,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. \"Such a financial punishment for a purposeful, blatant illegality is chump change for a company that makes tens of billions of dollars every year.\"</p><p>He and others questioned whether the FTC will force Facebookto make any meaningful changes to how it handles user data. This might include limits on what information it collects on people and how it targets its hugely lucrative ads to them. Beyond the fine, it's currently unclear what measures the settlement includes.</p><p>Senator Elisabeth Warren tweeted Facebook had come out a winner.</p><p>Since the Cambridge Analytica debacle erupted more than a year ago and prompted the FTC investigation, Facebookhas vowed to do a better job corralling its users' data. That scandal revealed that a data mining firm affiliated with President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign improperly accessed private information from as many as 87 million Facebook usersthrough a quiz app. The issue was whether Facebook violated a 2011 settlement with the FTC over user privacy.</p><p>Other leaky controls have also since come to light. Facebook acknowledged giving big tech companies like Amazon and Yahoo extensive access to users' personal data, in effect exempting them from its usual privacy rules. And it collected call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015.</p><p>The company faces a number of other investigations, both in the USand overseas, that could carry their own fines and, more importantly possible limits to its data collection. This includes nearly a dozen by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which oversees privacy regulation in the European Union.</p><p>(with newswires)</p><p>More videos available on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.english.rfi.fr\">http://www.english.rfi.fr</url>/</p><p>Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RFIENG-149117231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RFIENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJM-VVG1-JDJN-6403-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407847</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

Critics say this allows the spread of disinformation.</p><p>The social media company has come under intense pressure to change its ways, as disinformation has spread online and helped to fracture communities and dialogues along ideological divides.</p><p>Both Democrats and Republicans have criticised the website, with progressives arguing that the false and damaging information that has been allowed to spread should be better policed. Conservatives, meanwhile, have claimed - without evidence - that their free speech is being tamped down by a liberal-leaning social media culture.</p><p>Facebook, in declining to change its rules, is essentially placing the burden of regulation on the government, and saying they are doing the best they can given the current system in which they are operating.</p><p>\"In the absence of regulation, Facebook and other companies are left to design their own policies,\" said Rob Leathern, the company's director of product management overseeing the advertising integrity division, in a post announcing the decision.</p><p>He said that \"people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinised and debated in public\".</p><p>The explanation is unlikely to instil confidence in critics, who have noted that the speed with which misinformation can spread after it is posted makes it incredibly difficult for false statements to be scrutinised fully.</p><p>The hands-off approach showed its flaws in October, for instance, when a Facebook ad posted by Donald Trump's campaign making false accusations against Joe Biden and his son went viral and was viewed by millions. Mr Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic nomination to take on the president this November, asked the company to remove the advert. The request was refused.</p><p>Facebook has also come under fire from other Democrats in the 2020 field, including senator Elizabeth Warren, who has promised to break up big tech companies should she become president.</p><p>Ms Warren's campaign last year attempted to show the flaws in Facebook's decision not to screen adverts by running an ad on the platform that said Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, was personally backing Mr Trump's re-election. The advert, which included an outright and purposeful lie, was not removed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-59275541</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY2-9DD1-F021-60GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"482\"/><timeReceived>8:12 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> style=\"margin: 0px padding: 15px 0px line-height: 26px color: rgb(64, 64, 64)Clegg said what matters is not size but rather the rights and interests of consumers

style=\"margin: 0px padding: 15px 0px line-height: 26px color: rgb(64, 64, 64)The Facebook top executive argued that significant resources and strong new rules are required to fix those problems.

He <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/the-daily-need/the-facebook-co-founder-who-got-away/3847/\">left the company in 2007</url> to work with the Obama campaign.</p><p>\u201cThe government must hold Mark accountable,\u201d Mr. Hughes wrote in the 5,800-word column, arguing that the social media giant has grown far too powerful.</p><p>\u201cFrom our earliest days, Mark used the word \u2018domination\u2019 to describe our ambitions, with no hint of irony or humility,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOver a decade later, Facebookhas earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category.\u201d</p><p>Though others have made similar arguments over the past year, the essay by a longtime confidante of Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>drew intense interest, given Mr. Hughes\u2019s role in the start of the company and his once close-knit relationship with Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg.</nameText></person></p><p>Naturally, the debate also played out on Facebookitself and other social media platforms. While some called the essay a smart and crucial addition to the debate, others said Mr. Hughes\u2019s argument rang hollow because he had made hundreds of millions of dollars from Facebook. Others said that separating Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp would not fix the core issues posed by a few companies with so much power over the flow of information. And others said that if people don\u2019t like how Facebookbehaves, they should simply quit Facebook.</p><p>The specific prescription Mr. Hughes offered was government intervention. He wrote that the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department \u201cshould enforce antitrust laws by undoing the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions and banning future acquisitions for several years.\u201d He called the decision to allow Facebookto buy these two major competitors \u201cthe F.T.C.\u2019s biggest mistake.\u201d</p><p>He also argued that simply breaking up Facebookwould not be sufficient. \u201cWe need a new agency, empowered by Congress to regulate tech companies,\u201d he wrote and argued that \u201cits first mandate should be to protect privacy.\u201d</p><p>One person who embraced the essay was Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachussetts Democrat who has made the breakup of Facebook, Google and Amazon a cornerstone of her presidential campaign. She <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1126493176406081537\">expressed</url> her support on Twitter and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">on Medium</url>.</p><p>\u201cWeak antitrust enforcement has led to a dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector,\u201d Senator Warren wrote. \u201cVenture capitalists are now hesitant to fund new startups to compete with these big tech companies because it\u2019s so easy for the big companies to either snap up growing competitors or drive them out of business.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Facebook, Messenger and Instagram apps are displayed on a phone.

It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&amp;T being the two biggest examples.</p><p>Sense of responsibility</p><p>Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 at Harvard with Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. He left Facebook in 2007, and has said in a LinkedIn post he made half a billion dollars for his three years of work.</p><p>\"It's been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven't worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,\" Hughes said.</p><p>Facebook lost several executives after a bruising series of privacy and disinformation scandals since 2016. The founders of Instagram and WhatsApp have left, as has the executive who took over WhatsApp last year.</p><p>Chief product officer Chris Cox, who had been at the company for 13 years and was one of Zuckerberg's closest lieutenants, stepped down in March around the same time Facebook announced a pivot towards more private messaging.</p><p>He later cited \"artistic differences\" with Zuckerberg as his reason for leaving, without elaborating.</p><p>Critics say the company's pivot to privacy, which will introduce more encrypted communications, will restrict Facebook's ability to police propaganda, hate speech and other abusive behavior. Cox focused on improving tools to catch banned content in recent years.</p><p>Despite its scandals, the company's core business has proven resilient. Facebook has blown past earnings estimates in the past two quarters and its stock price barely budged in response to Hughes' opinion piece.</p><p>Hughes suggested Zuckerberg should be held responsible for privacy and other lapses at the company, echoing a call earlier this month by Democratic US Senator Ron Wyden to hold the CEO individually liable for \"repeated violations\" of privacy.</p><p>\"The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive,\" Hughes said.</p><p>Lawmaker pressure</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, has vowed to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google if elected.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power -\u00a0over our economy, our society, &amp; our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech,\" Warren said on Twitter on Thursday.</p><p>Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a statement he agreed in retrospect that US regulators should not have approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>\"The way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges,\" Khanna said.</p><p>In one of a number of scandals to hit the company, Facebook is accused of inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Facebook has been in advanced talks with the US Federal Trade Commission to settle a year-old investigation and said last month it expected to spend between US$3 billion and US$5 billion.</p><p>On Monday, Republican and Democratic US senators criticized reported plans for the settlement, calling on the FTC to impose harsher penalties and more restrictions on Facebook's business practices.</p><p>Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.</p><p>\"Mark is a good, kind person. But I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\" Hughes said.</p><p>Adam Mosseri, Facebook's previous head of news feed who recently took over Instagram, responded to Hughes on Twitter.</p><p>\"Regulation is important and necessary, but I'm not convinced breaking us up is the right path. Would love to chat about it if you're open,\" Mosseri said.</p><p>- Contact us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:english@hkej.com\">english@hkej.com</email></p><p>CG</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HKEJIT-2134217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HKEJIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W30-CV41-DXM8-X005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"987\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 EJ Insight of Hong Kong Economic Journal Co., Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>EJ Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5530\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook has been under scrutiny from regulators around the world over data sharing practices as well as hate speech and misinformation on its networks. Some U.S. lawmakers have pushed for action to break up big tech companies as well as federal privacy regulation. \"We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be. </p><p>Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American,\" Hughes, a former college roommate of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, wrote in a lengthy New York Times opinion piece. Facebook's social network has more than 2 billion users. It also owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than 1 billion people. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Facebook rejected Hughes' call for WhatsApp and Instagram to be made into separate companies, and said the focus should instead be on regulating the internet. Zuckerberg will be in Paris on Friday to discuss internet regulation with French President Emmanuel Macron. \"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the break up of a successful American company,\" Facebook spokesman Nick Clegg said in a statement. \"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for.\" Late on Thursday, Senator Mike Crapo, the Republican who chairs the banking committee and Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat, asked Facebook to answer questions about a potential cryptocurrency-based payments system using its social network and its data collection. The letter also asked questions about consumer privacy protections and if it had information about users' creditworthiness. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, told CNBC he thinks Facebook should be broken up and that the Justice Department's antitrust division needs to begin an investigation. Antitrust law makes such a proposal tough to execute because the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&amp;T being the two biggest examples. SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 at Harvard with Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. He left Facebook in 2007, and has said in a LinkedIn post he made half a billion dollars for his three years of work. \"It's been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven't worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,\" Hughes said. Facebook lost several executives after a bruising series of privacy and disinformation scandals since 2016. The founders of Instagram and WhatsApp have left, as has the executive who took over WhatsApp last year. Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, who had been at the company for 13 years and was one of Zuckerberg's closest lieutenants, stepped down in March around the same time Facebook announced a pivot toward more private messaging. He later cited \"artistic differences\" with Zuckerberg as his reason for leaving, without elaborating. Critics say the company's pivot to privacy, which will introduce more encrypted communications, will restrict Facebook's ability to police propaganda, hate speech and other abusive behavior. Cox focused on improving tools to catch banned content in recent years. Despite its scandals, the company's core business has proven resilient. Facebook has blown past earnings estimates in the past two quarters and its stock price barely budged in response to Hughes' opinion piece. Hughes suggested Zuckerberg should be held responsible for privacy and other lapses at the company, echoing a call earlier this month by Democratic U.S. Senator Ron Wyden to hold the CEO individually liable for \"repeated violations\" of privacy. \"The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive,\" Hughes said. LAWMAKER PRESSURE Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, has vowed to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google if elected. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power-over our economy, our society, &amp; our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech,\" Warren said on Twitter on Thursday. Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a statement he agreed in retrospect that U.S. regulators should not have approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. \"The way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges,\" Khanna said. In one of a number of scandals to hit the company, Facebook is accused of inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has been in advanced talks with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to settle a year-old investigation and said last month it expected to spend between US$3 billion and US$5 billion. On Monday, Republican and Democratic U.S. senators criticized reported plans for the settlement, calling on the FTC to impose harsher penalties and more restrictions on Facebook's business practices. Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. \"Mark is a good, kind person. But I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\" Hughes said. Adam Mosseri, Facebook's previous head of news feed who recently took over Instagram, responded to Hughes on Twitter. \"Regulation is important and necessary, but I'm not convinced breaking us up is the right path. Would love to chat about it if you're open,\" Mosseri said.

Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American,\" Hughes, a former college roommate of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, wrote in a lengthy New York Times opinion piece.</p><p>Facebook's social network has more than two billion users. It also owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than one billion people. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.</p><p>Facebook rejected Hughes' call for WhatsApp and Instagram to be made into separate companies, and said the focus should instead be on regulating the Internet.</p><p>\"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company,\" Facebook spokesman Nick Clegg said in a statement.</p><p>\"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the Internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for.\"</p><p>Late on Thursday, Senator Mike Crapo, the Republican who chairs the banking committee and Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat, asked Facebook to answer questions about a potential cryptocurrency-based payments system using its social network and its data collection.</p><p>The letter also asked questions about consumer privacy protections and if it had information about users' creditworthiness.</p><p>US Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, told CNBC he thinks Facebook should be broken up and that the Justice Department's antitrust division needs to begin an investigation.</p><p>Antitrust law makes such a proposal tough to execute because the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&amp;T being the two biggest examples.</p><p>Sense of responsibility</p><p>Hughes cofounded Facebook in 2004 at Harvard with Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. He left Facebook in 2007, and has said in a LinkedIn post he made half a billion dollars for his three years of work.</p><p>\"It's been 15 years since I cofounded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven't worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,\" Hughes said.</p><p>Facebook lost several executives after a bruising series of privacy and disinformation scandals since 2016. The founders of Instagram and WhatsApp have left, as has the executive who took over WhatsApp last year.</p><p>Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, who had been at the company for 13 years and was one of Zuckerberg's closest lieutenants, stepped down in March around the same time Facebook announced a pivot toward more private messaging.</p><p>He later cited 'artistic differences' with Zuckerberg as his reason for leaving, without elaborating.</p><p>Critics say the company's pivot to privacy, which will introduce more encrypted communications, will restrict Facebook's ability to police propaganda, hate speech and other abusive behavior. Cox focused on improving tools to catch banned content in recent years.</p><p>Despite its scandals, the company's core business has proven resilient. Facebook has blown past earnings estimates in the past two quarters and its stock price barely budged in response to Hughes' opinion piece.</p><p>Hughes suggested Zuckerberg should be held responsible for privacy and other lapses at the company, echoing a call earlier this month by Democratic US Senator Ron Wyden to hold the CEO individually liable for 'repeated violations' of privacy.</p><p>\"The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive,\" Hughes said.</p><p>Lawmaker pressure</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, has vowed to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google if elected.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2014 over our economy, our society, &amp; our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech,\" Warren said on Twitter on Thursday.</p><p>Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a statement he agreed in retrospect that US regulators should not have approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>\"The way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges,\" Khanna said.</p><p>In one of a number of scandals to hit the company, Facebook is accused of inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Facebook has been in advanced talks with the US Federal Trade Commission to settle a year-old investigation and said last month it expected to spend between $3 billion and $5 billion.</p><p>On Monday, Republican and Democratic US senators criticized reported plans for the settlement, calling on the FTC to impose harsher penalties and more restrictions on Facebook's business practices.</p><p>Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.</p><p>\"Mark is a good, kind person. But I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\" Hughes said.</p><p>Adam Mosseri, Facebook's previous head of news feed who recently took over Instagram, responded to Hughes on Twitter.</p><p>\"Regulation is important and necessary, but I'm not convinced breaking us up is the right path. Would love to chat about it if you're open,\" Mosseri said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRNDLY-144154223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRNDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W30-JJW1-JDJN-632G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"988\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Iran Cultural &amp;

Some US lawmakers have also pushed for action to break up big tech companies as well as federal privacy regulation. \"We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well-intentioned the leaders of these companies may be. Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American,\" Hughes, a former college roommate of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, wrote in a lengthy New York Times opinion piece.<br/>Facebook's social network has more than 2 billion users across the world. It also owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than 1 billion people. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Facebook rejected Hughes' call for WhatsApp and Instagram to be made into separate companies, and said the focus should instead be on regulating the internet. Zuckerberg will be in Paris on Friday to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss internet regulation.<br/> \"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the break up of a successful American company,\" Facebook spokesman Nick Clegg said in a statement. \"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for.\"<br/> US Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, told CNBC on Thursday he thinks Facebook needs to be broken up and that the Justice Department's antitrust division needs to begin an investigation. Antitrust law makes such a proposal tough to execute because the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&amp;T being the two biggest examples.<br/>Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 at Harvard with Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. He left Facebook in 2007, and has said in a LinkedIn post that he made half a billion dollars for his three years of work. \"It's been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven't worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,\" Hughes said in the New York Times piece. Hughes also suggested Zuckerberg should be held responsible for privacy and other lapses at the company. \"The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marvelled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive,\" he said.<br/> LAWMAKER PRESSURE<br/> Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, in March vowed to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google if elected US president to promote competition in the tech sector. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power-over our economy, our society, &amp; our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech,\" Warren said on Twitter on Thursday.<br/> Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a statement he agreed in retrospect that US regulators \"should not have approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram &amp; WhatsApp in 2012.\" He said that \"the way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges.\"<br/> In one of a number of security and privacy scandals to hit the company, Facebook is accused of inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The company has been in advanced talks with the US Federal Trade Commission to settle a year-old investigation and said last month it expected to spend between $3 billion and $5 billion on a penalty.<br/> On Monday, Republican and Democratic US senators criticized reported plans for the settlement, calling on the FTC to impose harsher penalties and more restrictions on Facebook's business practices. Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. \"Mark is a good, kind person. But I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\" Hughes said. \"I'm worried that Mark has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ZEENWS-n10998980</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ZEENWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3V-7TK1-JBYT-H1T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423543</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Zee News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,\" Hughes said in the New York Times piece. Hughes also suggested Zuckerberg should be held responsible for privacy and other lapses at the company. \"The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marvelled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive,\" he said. LAWMAKER PRESSURE Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, in March vowed to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google if elected U.S. president to promote competition in the tech sector. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power-over our economy, our society, &amp; our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech,\" Warren said on Twitter on Thursday. Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a statement he agreed in retrospect that U.S. regulators \"should not have approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram &amp; WhatsApp in 2012.\" He said that \"the way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges.\" In one of a number of security and privacy scandals to hit the company, Facebook is accused of inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The company has been in advanced talks with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to settle a year-old investigation and said last month it expected to spend between US$3 billion and US$5 billion on a penalty. On Monday, Republican and Democratic U.S. senators criticized reported plans for the settlement, calling on the FTC to impose harsher penalties and more restrictions on Facebook's business practices. Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. \"Mark is a good, kind person. But I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\" Hughes said. \"I'm worried that Mark has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them.\" (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru and David Shepardson and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Meredith Mazzilli) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11519626</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2S-W8R1-JCDN-10RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"812\"/><timeReceived>3:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

He left the company in 2007 to work with the Obama campaign.</p><p> \"The government must hold Mark accountable,\" Hughes wrote in the 5,800-word column arguing that the social media giant has grown far too powerful.</p><p> \"From our earliest days, Mark used the word 'domination' to describe our ambitions, with no hint of irony or humility,\" he wrote. \"Over a decade later, Facebook has earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world's social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category.\"</p><p> Though others have made similar arguments over the past year, the essay by a longtime confidant of Zuckerberg set off a firestorm on communication services owned by Facebook and others, given Hughes' role in the start of the company and his once close-knit relationship with Zuckerberg.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has made the breakup of Facebook, Google and Amazon a cornerstone of her presidential campaign, expressed her support on Twitter and on Medium.</p><p> \"Weak antitrust enforcement has led to a dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector,\" she wrote. \"Venture capitalists are now hesitant to fund new startups to compete with these big tech companies because it's so easy for the big companies to either snap up growing competitors or drive them out of business.\"</p><p>Hughes wrote that the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department \"should enforce antitrust laws by undoing the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions and banning future acquisitions for several years.\"</p><p> He called the decision to allow Facebook to buy these two major competitors \"the FTC's biggest mistake.\"</p><p> He also argued that simply breaking up Facebook would not be sufficient. \"We need a new agency, empowered by Congress to regulate tech companies,\" he wrote and argued that \"its first mandate should be to protect privacy.\"</p><p>Facebook aside, other responses to the piece fell into a few camps. Though some called it a smart and crucial addition to the debate, others said Hughes' argument rang hollow because he had made hundreds of millions of dollars from Facebook. Others said that separating Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp would not fix the core issues posed by having so much power over the flow of information in the hands of just a few tech companies. And others said that if people don't like how Facebook behaves, they should simply quit Facebook.</p><p> Heather Murphy is a New York Times writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-9fd096b28949612b4497d277b265d98b04fe2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W31-2FH1-JBCN-44T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"566\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

He left the company in 2007 and liquidated his shares in 2012. That netted him around $500 million, Hughes has said previously.</p><p>In his opinion piece, Hughes said CEO Mark Zuckerberg essentially has unilateral control over Facebook, which has become the de facto communications platform for hundreds of millions of people.</p><p>\"We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be,\" Hughes wrote. \"Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American.\"</p><p>Hughes wrote:</p><p>He said Facebook should be forced to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp into independent companies. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19.3 billion.</p><p>His articles comes as politicians on both sides of the aisle are stepping up calls for more regulation of Silicon Valley's largest companies.

Indeed, he is meeting with Government leaders this week to further that work.\"</p><p>Separately, Facebook expects to be hit with a fine of up to $5 billion from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for its failure to protect user data from political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which exploited a loophole in the company's developer tools to access demographic data from up to 87 million people without their consent.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

(FB[1]) reports second quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, July 24. The stock is in position to challenge its all-time intraday high of $218.62 set a year ago, but after the close on Tuesday, July 23, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced[2] that Facebook was one of four FAANG stocks[3] being investigated due to monopoly concerns.The DOJ will investigate internet activities[4] including search, social media, and online retailing. This is a cloud over earnings for all five FAANG stocks including Facebook.What we know is that Facebook stock is still consolidating a bear market decline of 43.7% from its all-time intraday high set during the week of July 27, 2018, to its Dec. 24 low of $123.02. Facebook shares opened Wednesday, July 24, at $197.22, staying above the quarterly value level at $193.39, which implies that fines and investigations are already priced in.Even with this move lower, Facebook stock has been on a roll. </p><p>At its Tuesday close of $202.36, the stock is up 54.4% year to date and in bull market territory at 64.5% above the Dec. 24 low. Fundamentally, Facebook stock is reasonably priced for a FAANG stock with a P/E ratio[5] of 30.06 without paying a dividend, according to Macrotrends. The DOJ investigation has been a known factor, but now we know that additional news flashes will occur.After Facebook reported earnings back on July 25, 2018, there was a huge gap[6] lower on July 26 on missed expectations. This included the fall-out from the social media company's privacy scandals, which remain under investigation.Analysts expect Facebook to post earnings per share[7] of $1.90 to $2.01 when it reports after the closing bell on Wednesday, July 24. Facebook remains the leading social media platform on the planet. It's more than just Facebook - its other platforms are Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. This combination should continue to capture a significant portion of the digital advertising market in the quarters ahead. It seems like a breakup of these entities may occur at some point in the future.Some on Wall Street are becoming cavalier, saying that Facebook is immune to the big tech investigations, even though the Federal Trade Commission dropped a $5 billion fine on the company. They also cheer the cryptocurrency[8] initiative called Libra. Regulators appear reluctant to let this fly. It seems to me that beating earnings estimates is \"in the cards,\" but the clouds of investigations are rumbling overhead.The daily chart for FacebookRefinitiv XENITHThe daily chart for Facebook shows that the stock has been above a \"golden cross[9]\" since April, 3 when the 50-day simple moving average[10] rose above the 200-day simple moving average to indicate that higher prices lie ahead. The stock slipped to a test of its 200-day simple moving average at $161.39 on June 3 as a buying opportunity.The close of $193.00 on June 28 was an important input to my proprietary analytics and resulted in the following key levels. A monthly value level for July is at $186.74, with an annual value level at $181.70. Its quarterly pivot is $193.39, and its semiannual risky level at $219.31, which is above the all-time intraday high of $218.62.Note the earnings volatility[11]. Back on July 25, 2018, the stock price posted a huge price gap lower. This was a delayed reaction to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Note the price gap higher on Jan. 31 following an earnings beat. There was also a price gap higher on April 25 despite an earnings miss. The annual value level at $181.70 was a pivot (or magnet) between April 23 and June 14, with 10 days of crisscrosses.The weekly chart for FacebookRefinitiv XENITHThe weekly chart for Facebook is positive but overbought[12], with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $193.58. The stock is well above its 200-week simple moving average, or \"reversion to the mean[13],\" at $149.08, which was a magnet between the weeks of Nov. 23 and Jan. 4, when the average rose from $134.20 to $135.97. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading[14] is projected to end this week at 85.45, up from 82.85 on July 19.Trading strategy: Buy Facebook shares weakness to the monthly and annual value levels at $186.74 and $181.70, respectively, and reduce holdings on strength to the semiannual risky level at $219.31. The quarterly pivot at $193.39 should remain a magnet.How to use my value levels and risky levels: Value levels and risky levels are based upon the last nine weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual closes. The first set of levels was based upon the closes on Dec. 31. The original annual level remains in play. The weekly level changes each week. The monthly level was changed at the end of each month, most recently on June 28. The quarterly level was changed at the end of June.My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility, investors should buy shares on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before their time horizon expires.Disclosure:The author hasno positions in any stocks mentionedand no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

That would be pretty much impossible for a smaller company,\" Clegg adds.<br/> The vice president also counters Hughes' argument that Facebook dominates too much of the online world. He argues that the company actually isn't a monopoly, denoting that its revenue only makes up 20 percent of the advertising marketplace. Mark Zuckerberg mirrors Clegg's arguments<br/> CEO Mark Zuckerberg also responded to Hughes in a TV interview, saying, \"When I read what he wrote, my main reaction was that what he's proposing that we do isn't going to do anything to help solve those issues.\"<br/> Talking to France Info, the CEO added, \"So I think that if what you care about is democracy and elections, then you want a company like us to be able to invest billions of dollars per year like we are in building up really advanced tools to fight election interference.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n11023644</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W77-PWF1-JBYT-H3BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 30, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In a Nov. 15 blog post, Facebook said the report contained several inaccuracies, including how early company executives learned of a campaign by Russian operatives to spread misinformation on its platform ahead of the 2016 U.S. election and how involved CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg had been in key decisions about how to address the spread of false information on the company's social network.</p><p>The company also hit back against claims in the article that it had sanctioned a strategy by an outside public relations firm to plant negative stories about its competitors, including Google LLC and Apple Inc.</p><p>The Times article sparked reactions on Capitol Hill and Wall Street and discussion about how to regulate big tech companies like Facebook.</p><p>Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, for instance, said in a Nov. 14 tweet that Facebook \"cannot be trusted to regulate itself,\" adding, \"It is long past time for us to take action.\" Cicilline has aired similar criticisms in the past, saying at a congressional hearing in July that Facebook and its peers have offered too much leeway to extremist content on their platforms in response to claims of political bias.</p><p>Meanwhile, David Siegel, co-founder of hedge fund Two Sigma, said in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that Silicon Valley should be self-regulated like Wall Street.</p><p>Siegel suggested using an oversight structure similar to that of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, which serves as an independent, nongovernmental regulator for all securities firms doing business with the public in the U.S.</p><p>\"It's essentially an industry consortium that is sanctioned by the government to provide investor protection and promote market integrity,\" Siegel said in the interview.</p><p>Facebook shares ended the Nov. 15 trading session down 0.26%, closing at $143.85 per share.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-48053561</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSG-9N31-F19Y-C1K8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"391\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Law enforcement authorities and regulators including the Irish Data Protection Commissioner have been told about the incident. Shares declined 2.6 per cent to US$164.42 at the close in New York..</p><p>User data leaks, security breaches and the spread of misinformation have forced Facebook to confront hostile congressional hearings and uproar from users. This week's breach adds to concerns that Facebook is collecting too much personal information and not looking after it properly. Data is the lifeblood of its advertising business, so any limits on its activities that stem from these missteps could crimp the company's earning power.</p><p>U.S. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the breach was \"deeply concerning\" and called for an investigation.

The vulnerability allowed hackers to steal access tokens - digital keys that keep people logged into Facebook so they don't need to re-enter passwords. Once logged in, the attackers could take control.</p><p>\"This attack exploited the complex interaction of multiple issues in our code. It stemmed from a change we made to our video uploading feature in July 2017, which impacted 'View As,'\" Facebook said. \"The attackers not only needed to find this vulnerability and use it to get an access token, they then had to pivot from that account to others to steal more tokens.\"</p><p>While access codes were taken from 50 million accounts in the recent breach, Facebook said it doesn't know whether any personal information was gathered or misused from those accounts.</p><p>The vulnerability let the attacker use a Facebook account as if they were the account holder, executives said during a conference call on Friday. \"We need to do more to prevent this from happening in the first place,\" Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal from earlier this year, which involved a developer handing over Facebook user profile information to a third party, affected up to 85 million people and led to a congressional hearing. This new vulnerability is potentially worse because it let hackers log in as the holder of the account, giving them access to information that was not otherwise public.</p><p>\"We may never know\" who was behind this, Facebook executive Guy Rosen said. \"We did see this attack being used at a fairly large scale.\"</p><p>The hack required sophistication, said Rosen. The attackers had the resources to find three different bugs and exploit them in tandem. Facebook is investigating the breach in partnership with the FBI, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the possibility of nation state involvement.</p><p>The news could weigh on growth and hurt profit in the second half of this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral. \"Facebook also may lose users who have been asked to reset sign-ins\" and face fines under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, he wrote Friday in a note to investors.</p><p>Everyone whose profile used the \"View As\" tool in the last year will have to log in to Facebook again, and any apps that used Facebook to log in. From there, they'll be able to see a statement from Facebook explaining what happened. The company estimated that about 90 million people will have to log in again. Facebook has more than 2 billion users.</p><p>Bloomberg.com( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com\">https://www.bloomberg.com</url> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

The vulnerability allowed hackers to steal access tokens - digital keys that keep people logged into Facebookso they don't need to re-enter passwords. Once logged in, the attackers could take control.</p><p>\"This attack exploited the complex interaction of multiple issues in our code. It stemmed from a change we made to our video uploading feature in July 2017, which impacted 'View As,'\" Facebooksaid. \"The attackers not only needed to find this vulnerability and use it to get an access token, they then had to pivot from that account to others to steal more tokens.\"</p><p>While access codes were taken from 50 million accounts in the recent breach, Facebooksaid it doesn't know whether any personal information was gathered or misused from those accounts.</p><p>The vulnerability let the attacker use a Facebook account as if they were the account holder, executives said during a conference call on Friday. \"We need to do more to prevent this from happening in the first place,\" Chief Executive Officer <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal from earlier this year, which involved a developer handing over Facebookuser profile information to a third party, affected up to 85 million people and led to a congressional hearing. This new vulnerability is potentially worse because it let hackers log in as the holder of the account, giving them access to information that was not otherwise public.</p><p>\"We may never know\" who was behind this, Facebookexecutive Guy Rosen said. \"We did see this attack being used at a fairly large scale.\"</p><p>The hack required sophistication, said Rosen. The attackers had the resources to find three different bugs and exploit them in tandem. Facebookis investigating the breach in partnership with the FBI, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the possibility of nation state involvement.</p><p>The news could weigh on growth and hurt profit in the second half of this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral. \"Facebookalso may lose users who have been asked to reset sign-ins\" and face fines under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, he wrote Friday in a note to investors.</p><p>Everyone whose profile used the \"View As\" tool in the last year will have to log in to Facebookagain, and any apps that used Facebookto log in. From there, they'll be able to see a statement from Facebookexplaining what happened. The company estimated that about 90 million people will have to log in again.

Data is the lifeblood of its advertising business, so any limits on its activities that stem from these missteps could crimp the company's earning power.</p><p>Facebookspends more protecting <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>than most Fortune 500 CEOs make in a year( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/keeping-zuckerberg-safe-now-costs-an-extra-10-million-a-year\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/keeping-zuckerberg-safe-now-costs-an-extra-10-million-a-year</url> )</p><p>Facebookfallout shatters myth of big tech's everlasting upward trajectory( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/investing/facebook-shares-plunge-after-earnings-fall-short\">https://business.financialpost.com/investing/facebook-shares-plunge-after-earnings-fall-short</url> )</p><p>There was a loophole in Facebook's code for a feature called \"View As\" that let people see what their account looks like to someone else. The vulnerability allowed hackers to steal access tokens - digital keys that keep people logged into Facebookso they don't need to re-enter passwords. Once logged in, the attackers could take control.</p><p>\"This attack exploited the complex interaction of multiple issues in our code. It stemmed from a change we made to our video uploading feature in July 2017, which impacted 'View As,'\" Facebooksaid. \"The attackers not only needed to find this vulnerability and use it to get an access token, they then had to pivot from that account to others to steal more tokens.\"</p><p>While access codes were taken from 50 million accounts in the recent breach, Facebooksaid it doesn't know whether any personal information was gathered or misused from those accounts.</p><p>The vulnerability let the attacker use a Facebook account as if they were the account holder, executives said during a conference call on Friday. \"We need to do more to prevent this from happening in the first place,\" Chief Executive Officer <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal from earlier this year, which involved a developer handing over Facebookuser profile information to a third party, affected up to 85 million people and led to a congressional hearing. This new vulnerability is potentially worse because it let hackers log in as the holder of the account, giving them access to information that was not otherwise public.</p><p>\"We may never know\" who was behind this, Facebookexecutive Guy Rosen said. \"We did see this attack being used at a fairly large scale.\"</p><p>The hack required sophistication, said Rosen. The attackers had the resources to find three different bugs and exploit them in tandem. Facebookis investigating the breach in partnership with the FBI, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the possibility of nation state involvement.</p><p>The news could weigh on growth and hurt profit in the second half of this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral. \"Facebookalso may lose users who have been asked to reset sign-ins\" and face fines under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, he wrote Friday in a note to investors.</p><p>Everyone whose profile used the \"View As\" tool in the last year will have to log in to Facebookagain, and any apps that used Facebookto log in. From there, they'll be able to see a statement from Facebookexplaining what happened. The company estimated that about 90 million people will have to log in again. Facebookhas more than 2 billion users.</p><p>Bloomberg.com( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com\">https://www.bloomberg.com</url> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

The court will decide how far Facebook's obligations go to ensure such content stays away from its platform.</p><p>In a June opinion that was heavily criticized by Facebook, an adviser at the Luxembourg-based EU court said the social media giant could be ordered to remove offensive content posted by users in the EU and also look for similar posts worldwide. The EU's law for digital services and electronic commerce \"does not regulate the territorial scope\" of such an obligation, according to Advocate General Maciej Szpunar's advice.</p><p>'Enormous repercussions'</p><p>The ruling \"has potentially enormous repercussions for hosting and platform providers,\" said Philip James, a technology lawyer with Sheridans in London.</p><p>\"Whilst the current case focuses on hateful content, rather than copyright, there is a growing trend for the courts to fall favourably towards rights holders and those affected by hate speech,\" said James. \"There is a real likelihood therefore that Facebook may end up with a considerably greater burden to police its content than it currently has.\"</p><p>Platforms from Facebook to Google's YouTube won a nod of approval from the EU earlier this year for tackling hate speech posted online as part of a code of conduct signed with the commission in 2016. The companies vowed to tackle online hate speech within 24 hours, once made aware of it.</p><p>Despite the platforms' efforts, EU officials have been mulling new bloc-wide rules, building on existing legislation in Germany, that could hit big tech firms with possible fines if they fail to remove illegal hate speech quickly enough. The discussions fit into broader plans by the EU to overhaul liability rules for platforms.</p><p>National courts</p><p>The court's ruling will also weigh how far the powers of national courts go in ordering global tech firms to remove posts. Facebook, in a statement on the court's non-binding opinion in June, said that \"the scope of court orders from one country must be limited to its borders.\"</p><p>Facebook declined to add further comment ahead of Thursday's decision.</p><p>Austria's Supreme Court last year sought the EU judges' guidance in a dispute between Facebook and Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, a former Green member of the European Parliament, who was the subject of a number of offensive posts on a Facebook user's account. She asked for an order against the company to block any further publications of pictures of her if the text alongside them included similarly offensive content.</p><p>The Austrian court also asked whether under EU law companies could be forced to remove any content from its platform \"with an equivalent meaning\" to illegal information it has been made aware of. Lawyers said this is an issue also faced by copyright owners on platforms such as YouTube, or Instagram, where uploads of previously taken down copies keep popping up online.</p><p>Should the EU court find that Facebook \"has a broad obligation to monitor its platform for repeated infringements\" it could not only help victims of hate speech, but also affect \"parties hurt by copyright or trade mark infringement online,\" said Bruess.</p><p>The case is: C-18/18, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek v Facebook Ireland Limited.</p><p>-With assistance from Natalia Drozdiak.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019100255861633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5Y-1NM1-JDH1-C2HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

The court will decide how far Facebook's obligations go to ensure such content stays away from its platform.</p><p>In a June opinion that was heavily criticized by Facebook, an adviser at the Luxembourg-based EU court said the social media giant could be ordered to remove offensive content posted by users in the EU and also look for similar posts worldwide. The EU's law for digital services and electronic commerce \"does not regulate the territorial scope\" of such an obligation, according to Advocate General Maciej Szpunar's advice.</p><p>'Enormous repercussions'</p><p>The ruling \"has potentially enormous repercussions for hosting and platform providers,\" said Philip James, a technology lawyer with Sheridans in London.</p><p>\"Whilst the current case focuses on hateful content, rather than copyright, there is a growing trend for the courts to fall favourably towards rights holders and those affected by hate speech,\" said James. \"There is a real likelihood therefore that Facebook may end up with a considerably greater burden to police its content than it currently has.\"</p><p>Platforms from Facebook to Google's YouTube won a nod of approval from the EU earlier this year for tackling hate speech posted online as part of a code of conduct signed with the commission in 2016. The companies vowed to tackle online hate speech within 24 hours, once made aware of it.</p><p>Despite the platforms' efforts, EU officials have been mulling new bloc-wide rules, building on existing legislation in Germany, that could hit big tech firms with possible fines if they fail to remove illegal hate speech quickly enough. The discussions fit into broader plans by the EU to overhaul liability rules for platforms.</p><p>National courts</p><p>The court's ruling will also weigh how far the powers of national courts go in ordering global tech firms to remove posts. Facebook, in a statement on the court's non-binding opinion in June, said that \"the scope of court orders from one country must be limited to its borders.\"</p><p>Facebook declined to add further comment ahead of Thursday's decision.</p><p>Austria's Supreme Court last year sought the EU judges' guidance in a dispute between Facebook and Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, a former Green member of the European Parliament, who was the subject of a number of offensive posts on a Facebook user's account. She asked for an order against the company to block any further publications of pictures of her if the text alongside them included similarly offensive content.</p><p>The Austrian court also asked whether under EU law companies could be forced to remove any content from its platform \"with an equivalent meaning\" to illegal information it has been made aware of. Lawyers said this is an issue also faced by copyright owners on platforms such as YouTube, or Instagram, where uploads of previously taken down copies keep popping up online.</p><p>Should the EU court find that Facebook \"has a broad obligation to monitor its platform for repeated infringements\" it could not only help victims of hate speech, but also affect \"parties hurt by copyright or trade mark infringement online,\" said Bruess.</p><p>The case is: C-18/18, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek v Facebook Ireland Limited.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019100255859214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5X-C3Y1-F103-337V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

So Facebook will allow you to create a separate dating profile that will display your first name and age, while allowing you to add further details like hometown, religion and occupation, as you see fit.Your name won't be suggested to your Facebook friends unless you have them in your 'secret crush' list and they do as well, and will be shown to friends of friends only if you opt in. Overall, the people suggested to you, the people to whom you're suggested and the people you name as secret crushes will be the only ones seeing your dating profile. And you can bring over your Instagram following and posts, if you connect the two accounts. </p><p>You can also share details of your date with trusted people on Messenger (what's the fun if you can't do that!).Facebook says it has gone to a lot of trouble ensuring privacy so 'your dating activity, such as people you like or pass on, won't be shared with anyone outside Dating.'In addition to the U.S., Facebook Dating is currently available in 19 other countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, Suriname, Thailand, Uruguay and Vietnam.Antitrust Probes from U.S. StatesTwo separate groups of U.S. state attorneys general are investigating technology companies like Facebook and Alphabet GOOGL[2]-owned Google.The first announcement, led by New York, and including seven other U.S. states and the District of Columbia, mentions Facebook. The second one that was started by Texas appears broader and includes support from 40 U.D. states. The announcement didn't name names.In a filing on Friday, Alphabet said that the Department of Justice had requested in late August, information and documents related to prior antitrust probes of the company. It also said, 'We expect to receive in the future, similar investigative demands from state attorneys general.' And that it was co-operating with regulators, as always. \"We look forward to working with the attorneys general to answer questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,\" Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said.'If we stop innovating, people can easily leave our platform. This underscores the competition we face,' Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president for state and local policy, said in a statement. 'We will work constructively with state attorneys general and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.'Antitrust acts are nothing new for big tech. While Facebook has snapped up its competitors shrinking competition in the process, Google has used various means, including preference to its own shopping service over rivals on its platform, thus limiting choice. But Google has been ceding share to newer entrants in digital advertising, such as Facebook and Amazon AMZN[3], which can help it argue on antitrust issues.Third-party sellers have complained that Amazon treats them unfairly and uses its platform to promote its in-house brands. And again, developers have complained that AppleAAPL[4] keeps non-iOS apps away from its App Store and Spotify has taken it to court over App Store policies that make it hard to compete with Apple Music for paid subscribers.Separately, Facebook, Google, Microsoft MSFT[5] and TwitterTWTR[6] security teams met with U.S. intelligence agencies including the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Department of Homeland Security, to discuss security strategies ahead of the November 2020 U.S. state, federal and presidential elections.Feature UpdatesFirst, the company announced recent improvements made in its data portability tools that support its decade-long practice of helping users to download and transfer their data wherever they like. The company has now published a white paper outlining points that should trigger a conversation about the kinds of data that can be ported, who would be responsible for protecting the data during its transfer, and so on. The goal is to increase awareness among companies and individuals about what it really means to be able to do this in the context of new privacy legislations like the GDPR that are increasingly coming into force.Second, it is replacing the 'tag suggestions' feature (for those who have it turned on) with the 'face recognition' feature. So all new users and those using the tags setting will now see an easy on or off switch for a broader set of uses of face recognition, including ID protection. Facebook is notifying users about the change in the newsfeed. For existing users who have the setting turned off, there won't be any notification about the change.Third, the company is contemplating hiding the number of 'likes' from public view, that it says creates tension among users about the number of likes on their posts, creates the need to post only those things that are likely to get more likes and prevents them from more spontaneous sharing. This won't impact businesses because the information will still be there on the platform and be visible to the person posting, whether individual or company. Deepfake VideosFacebook is teaming up with Microsoft, the Partnership on AI coalition and academics from Cornell, MIT, Oxford University, UC Berkeley, University of Maryland, College Park and University at Albany-SUNY to launch a contest for deepfake detection.This is a newish take on the old concept of doctoring videos so they say things that they didn't originally. Deepfake videos take this concept to the next level by using artificial intelligence to create hyper-realistic fakes. Because they are AI-generated, they are likely to get ever harder to detect as AI technologies advance.While there is a certain urgency in honing these tools because of the elections next year, this is really an ongoing battle that will continue for a long time, with some wins and some losses. That's why technology companies have the responsibility of creating the best detection tools possible.RecommendationFacebook shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  Here there ladies, good morning to you.  Thanks  so much Gerri.  Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26thm happy Thursday.  Your top  stories right now 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is the busiest single day of earnings season so far, industry giants  like General Motors, Starbucks, Amazon, Microsoft all reporting their  quarterly results today.

Stock was strong.  In yesterday's closing session, the Dow  ended up 60 points, the S&amp;P was up five, and the NASDAQ was down a  fraction, three and a half points lower.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, we've got gains across the board.  Fractional move  but the FT-100 is up 12, CAC Quarante in Paris is up 24 and the DAX Index  up 21 points.  </p><p>Investors are waiting on the European Central Bank decision this morning,  that's due out in the next hour.  No change in rates expected but the focus  will be on the ECB President, Mario Draghi and his comments about the  Future stimulus during his news conference.  We'll bring you all the news  from Europe coming up.</p><p>In Asia Overnight markets were mixed, the Shanghai Composite down one and a  third percent, worst performer in China as you see.</p><p>And Facebook back on Wall Street's friends list, the stock soaring in the  premarket this morning due to strong first quarter results showing an  increase in daily users and monthly users despite the ongoing data scandal.   The stock at 107 and change right now, we're breaking down those numbers,  talk with Dan Niles, his number one position there coming up.</p><p>Another speed bump for Tesla to report, the new trouble for Elon Musk's  electric automaker as the key member of the autopilot team departs amid new  safety questions.  </p><p>Then from flamethrowers to fire breathers, Elon Musk reveals his latest  project, a cyborg dragon.  The first details on the wild new robot coming  up this morning.</p><p>And then walk a mile in dad shoes, Adidas unveils the perfect sneaker for  keeping that dad bod in top shape. </p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to talk  all about it, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  The Wall Street  Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman along with Iraq  and Afghanistan War Veteran, FOX News Contributor, Pete Hegseth is here.   Great to see you Pete.  </p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see -- if those are the  world's best sneakers, the world has gone mad.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p>HEGSETH:  They're OK but the best?  I don't know.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  The trend in cool sneakers is the uglier and  the more expensive.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Oh, really.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can find you a pair of $1,200 sneakers that certainly none of  your children would be caught wearing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But can you press a button and order pizza from it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Actually, you know what --</p><p>HEGSETH:  That's true.  That's true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have no sneakers (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Those shoes -- those -- I'm talking about sneakers so expensive,  they should come with their own brick pizza oven quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot going on this morning, biggest day in earnings so far.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think it's exciting to have the dad bod trend continue  but, yes, you -- expectation is so high for American business and American  business keeps beating them.  So we'll see again today if the Facebook  pattern continues to the rest of the techs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're talking about 18, 19 percent earnings growth for  the S&amp;P500 for the first quarter, same thing for 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But with valuations going into this quarter, it has to be better  than perfect.  There is no such thing as 110 percent in terms of you can  deliver a 100 percent but they need to deliver more than that.  </p><p>One of the things that Facebook did yesterday and we'll get into it is they  up the buybacks.  So they're going to buyback an additional $9 billion in  shares adding to the $6 billion previously authorized.  So I think Facebook  management stepped back and said, \"We need to do something to reduce this  stock.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll see about that.  It is getting juiced this  morning, that's for sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's up pretty big.  Coming up this morning, joining the  conversation, the Chairman of the House Republican Conference and  Washington Congresswoman, Cathy McMorris Rodgers is with us.  California  Congressman, John Garamendi is here along with Alpha One Capital Partners  Founding Partner, Dan Niles who predicted a very good quarter for Facebook  by the way, he's going to weigh in on the numbers.  Plus, Universal Health  Services Founder and CEO, Alan Miller is with us as well.  Don't miss a  moment of it.  </p><p>We kick it off right here this hour with this, the technology earnings  blitz on Wall Street, investors are watching Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel  all ahead of their results after the bell tonight and it's going to be  important given what's been going on with tech.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook topped Wall Street expectations yesterday reporting  adjusted earnings of $1.69 a share, revenue coming in $11.97 billion.  It  is the technology titan's first earnings report since the user data crisis,  the stock is trading up this morning.  As you can see, up six and two- thirds percent or $10-1/2 a share, James Freeman, your reaction to the  Facebook news.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think it's probably sometimes difficult for people to  understand why a company can have all of these bad headlines and have its  business performing so well.  And I think it's a couple of things.</p><p>One is that while people are concerned about their data, they obviously  value what they get from Facebook in terms of the ability to communicate  with friends more than they're concerned about having to share information  about themselves.  The other issue is that even if regulation comes, big  incumbent in an industry tend to do fine.  We have a heavy regulated  situation, the barriers to entry, the smaller competitors go up, and the  new side of our paper had a story this week about an E.U. regulator going  out to California talking to the big tech companies about privacy  regulations.</p><p>She thought they were going to freak out and they said, \"No, we're good.\"   This regulation is always a bigger burden for the smaller competitors.  So  if it comes in the U.S., you worry about the next challenger to Facebook  more than Facebook. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting because even the company's total cost in  expenses were up 39 percent year-over-year in the first quarter but the  acceleration of expense growth is driven by other things, the anticipation  of regulation driven by security, content investment, and long-term bets  like IA.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Now they did say to expect higher expenses going forward  and some of that will be I'm sure having to deal with compliance and  political nuttiness side of Washington but the business is very healthy  because people despite their unease welcome the trade.  I give you my data,  you know all about me and then return, I get lots of services for free.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially young people.  Especially young people. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So far, people think that way.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So far.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he added 70 million monthly, uses a lot of what was  discovered about -- and by the way, people keep referring to this as the  Cambridge Analytica scandal at Facebook --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know, it's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is a scan -- this is a gross misuse and reckless disregard  for people's privacy in data literally for more than the last decade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  Let's go back to the Barrack Obama years and what -- he  was a master at mining all of the data.  And Facebook was like, \"Come on  in, here's all of our user information.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's go back --</p><p>HEGSETH:  And (INAUDIBLE) Facebook into the head of the curve.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well the -- it started even before that.  It started even before  President Obama won the White House the first go around.  It started back  in 2007.  The bigger -- so the question is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it was really effective for the Obama presidency.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In 2012 for sure.  So will Facebook user stick around?  Will the  user growth continue to go great guns the way it has?  And tell you, what  are the advertisers going to do?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And so far based on just anecdotal information and evidence that  the Wall Street Journal collected, Sheryl Sandberg said yesterday the  company hasn't seen a meaningful trend of advertisers leaving the platform  but it's still a wait and see.  Plus, the stock through yesterday's close  was down 18 percent from the record high in early February.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you get a boost this morning, it's still off nearly 20  percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well the advertisers aren't stupid, they want the 2.2 billion  users on them.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Of course.  And the 2.2 billion users are -- they may have been a  Few bad headlines but if you were logging on to Facebook yesterday, you're  logging on to Facebook today, they have been incredibly effective at  monetizing their business model.</p><p>And as James says, he's exactly right, they get to sit at the table with  the regulators which means they'll benefit and find a way to maneuver any  regulations coming down the pipe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Diamond &amp; Silk are testifying this morning before the House  Judiciary Committee after saying that their conservative content on  Facebook was censored.  The Congressional panel also inviting  representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter to the hearing on social  media filtering practices and its effect on free speech.</p><p>Bottom line here, this is one of the issues that Congress is most upset  about and that they're going to be pressing --</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the fact that they are deciding what we see and what we  hear.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what Diamond &amp; Silk are going to be testifying about  today.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  It will be great TV I'll tell you that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HEGSETH:  I mean, they don't hold back, set your DVRs, I'm sure it will be  fascinating.  But they -- their finger is on the pulse of what I think is  the biggest concern for many Americans around Facebook, is my content being  blocked based on algorithm I'm not aware of?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HEGSETH:  And is there an ideological slant to that algorithm and people --  they have a platform to speak out.  Most people who are speaking out don't  and have this sense that their content isn't reaching people, a big concern  for --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why they don't get sued because they're supposed to be  the area that people from all different areas can talk and exchange ideas.</p><p>HEGSETH:  But they're not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But they're -- they may not be, that's the issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But if you're pro-life and pro second amendment, your content  will be taken down quite frankly in some instances.  I've had friends --</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's wrong.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've had friends that experience that.  There was an incident  that I believe Mark Zuckerberg was asked about when he testified in front  of Congress, it was a Catholic University's content of Jesus on the cross  was censored.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he did -- and he acted like -- he played dumb.  Maybe he  didn't know about that one instant.  But, again, they're trying to be more  transparent Facebook is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they trying?  That's what I wanted to see, actually the  effort because I don't know about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to be -- they're trying to be more (INAUDIBLE)  until the users, what would trigger con -- basically content censorship.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think this is going to be an increasing issue.  I mean,  you celebrate these social media companies because they did disrupt media  in the sense that the New York Times doesn't have the political, cultural  power it used to given that everyone can communicate now.  But this is the  question, are they the new gatekeepers that are going to do what the yield  gatekeepers did in screening out opinions that don't agree with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you a platform or are you a gatekeeper?  We got to talk  about former FBI Director Jim Comey, did anybody see that interview last  night?  I tweeted this, \"Wow, just wow.\"</p><p>His leaked memos, a catalyst for the special counsel investigation was more  widely shared than previously thought.  Source is telling FOX News that  Comey likely gave his documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald  and possibly another person, along with the Columbia law school professor.   Watch this as Comey tries to defend his actions of leaking the memos to the  professor last night in the CNN Town Hall, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think that there's any credence from the  president's claims that you broke the law when you released your memos?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  I don't.  That won't surprise you, I  don't.  In fact, I think he's just making stuff up.  I didn't leak memos, I  asked a friend to communicate the substance of one unclassified --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that it  would be out in the media, I wanted it to get in the media.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p>COMEY:  As a private citizen, I could do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just because you say you're not leaking, Dagen, doesn't mean  you're not leaking.  We're not idiots, OK?  We're not morons.  You actually  leaked a memo to your friend who's a professor, now you're saying, \"I  didn't leak it because I told him, \"Oh, get it to the New York Times, just  the content, don't give the actual paper.\"  I mean, this is -- I'm  outraged.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You just defined what the word leak means.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does he think anyone is buying this?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He doesn't care if they're buy -- he only cares if they're  buying that book that he's written.  I tweeted last night, I said, \"To call  Washington, D.C. a bunch -- a snake pit is an insult to snakes.\"</p><p>FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He -- the -- what did he say, \"That I'm not a weasel\" that was  in the notes that were --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, he came off like such a weasel last night.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know if he told the president I'm not a weasel.  Again,  by his actions, defining what weasel means.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't that extraordinary though that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's not funny actually.  I'm laughing --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really not funny because he's taking advantage of this  platform that he has with this book tour and just ignoring facts.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Let him keep speaking.  Please, keep speaking.  Let us see more  documents, let the investigations continue because all it does is exonerate  the collusion and all of the narratives they have and expose the snake pit  for what it is.</p><p>He says, \"I'm a private citizen\" yet the day before you weren't and the  document you created isn't private and you have no right to leak it and the  fact that he did what he did, he's a leaking launderer, right?  He wanted  to launder his leaks through somebody else that he could write his  (INAUDIBLE) it's all absurd.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, the Wall Street Journal has been  writing about what a weasel this guy is --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- literally since before 2003.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They warned President Obama not to appoint him as the FBI  Director, the y-- the editorial page at the Journal warned President Trump,   nothing (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HEGSETH:  James, how did you know?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because if you go through the man's history, he abuses power,  there's prosecutorial overreach, he is not a boy scout, he is less than a  snake.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thank you.  Now, that's the pattern overtime and you saw it with  the e-mail investigation, you saw it with him basically running a rough  shot over longstanding Justice Department policies, acting as if he's a  prosecutor, he's not -- his job, head of the FBI to investigate and a lot  of prosecutors to make the appropriate decisions.</p><p>So it's just over and over again not following the rules but it's funny,  when you play that clip, I haven't seen it before and he started describing  what he was doing --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- thought, \"Gee, that sounds a lot like leaking.\"  What am I  missing here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But kudos to Anderson Cooper and he did the stick to  the fire on that question and say, \"But isn't that leaking over and over  again?\"  To me, that was such arrogance and then to go on all of these  shows and say the president is unfit to be president.</p><p>You're unfit to be FBI director.  I mean, that's what's really clear.  But  the arrogance is up there with -- remember Shkreli when he was playing  videogames in the courtroom, that's where this arrogance is, I equate the  same.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And confidence, I don't want to change the subject too much.  But  you look at the resources, is FBI devoted to enforcing the rules of college  basketball?  Meanwhile ignoring for example this horrendous scandal in  gymnastics that was going on at the same time.  I mean, there's a long list  of not just the ethical issues but the confidence issues when he was  running the FBI.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure is.  All right, thank you for that.  We're going to take a  break.  When we come back, a manhunt is underway this morning for a suspect  accused of killing a main police officer then stealing his police cruiser.   The latest on the search, plus a startling new statistic about how many of  our heroes have been killed already this year.</p><p>Plus, Tesla's rough ride ahead of the self-driving business quits amidst  continuing safety issues.  Meanwhile, Elon Musk announces a shocking new  robot venture, we've got all the details right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A cop killer is on the loose in Maine this  morning.  An urgent manhunt underway, Cheryl Casone with the details and  headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, this is John Williams.  They say the 29-year-old gun down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine, that is just  north of Augusta.  </p><p>Williams then drove the cruiser to a nearby convenient store and robbed it.   Police releasing this photo captured of him from inside of that stolen car.   He then abandoned the car nearby, he has not been seen since.  Deputy Cole  had been on the force for 13 years, he lives behind a son.  </p><p>The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot in a Dallas Home  Depot, one of those officers was killed.  Official Rogelio Santander died  from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him in the back of  the head while trying to make an arrest.  Twenty-two officers have been  shot and killed so far this year, that is more than double from the same  time last year.  On average, at least one officer reportedly has been shot  to death every week so far in 2018.</p><p>Well, Tesla suffering a major lost in its self-driving car program.  The  leader of that division has left the company.  Jim Keller has taken a job  at Intel making him the latest to the string of very high level departures  from Tesla.  The self-driving program under new scrutiny after a Model X  driver died using autopilot in a crash south of San Francisco last month.</p><p>Meanwhile, Elon Musk is already on to his next project, he casually tweeted  last night that he's building a cyborg dragon.  Yes, you heard me  correctly.  He didn't give us any more details, it's unclear what he plans  to do with the sci-fi robot but, yes, the cyborg dragon.  Shares of Tesla  Maria are lower in the premarket but he's going to build a cyborg dragon.   Well, I'll let you sponge on that one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is that?  What's a cyborg dragon?  </p><p>CASONE:  We don't know, that's all he tweets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just a robot.</p><p>CASONE:  Oki-dokie, we'll look for that.  Fix your cars.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Robots, take it over man.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just have to share this tweet from one of the viewers, Michael  Hutchins related to the Comey discussion.  Remember what George Costanza  told Jerry Seinfeld, \"It's not a lie if you believe it.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, again, it's turned into a Seinfeld episode.  I wanted to  pass that along.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well we'll see what the I.G. report says about Jim Comey and  the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation because that's going to be the  focus in the next I.G. report that's coming out in the month of May.  We  know what the earlier I.G. report, it recommended criminal charges against  Andrew McCabe.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes, absolutely.  And we were talking in between, the vast  difference between how James Comey has treated others and the treatment he  expects themselves, it is offensive on how he looks down to people in a  condescending way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, good  news for the president, a new poll shows that Americans believe President  Trump's policies are helping the economy.  We're taking a closer look at  those policies and how they're giving small businesses a big boost.</p><p>Then George H.W. Boost is out of intensive care and his biggest concern,  the health of his beloved Houston Rockets, more on that coming up this  morning, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings alert, Universal Health Services  reporting after the bell last night.  Profit and revenue up from a year  ago.  The company is shy of analyst expectations.  However, the numbers  Universal reporting adjusted earnings of $2.45 a share on revenue of $2.69  billion.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Founder and CEO of Universal Health Services,  Alan Miller.  Alan, great to see you.</p><p>ALAN MILLER, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  Characterize the quarter for  us, what went off?</p><p>MILLER:  Well, we have two big segments.  One segment outpace the industry,  the other segment is catching up.  We've had some issues of shortage of  doctors and nurses and a few other incidents, and we're in the U.K. which  is going really well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The hospital segment in general has been struggling because we  see that the needs will get bigger and consolidate within hospitals.  Do  you still see that?</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  There's consolidation because the insurance companies don't  want to pay and they're finding all kinds of ways to deny payment even  after we provide the service.</p><p>So -- I mean, that's not a good basis for business.  So we're letting them  know about it, we're suing them if we have to.  But the demand is so great  that the business is just a very sound business.  And we are -- and have  been from the outset a pioneer in mental health and mental health now as  you well know, two things are happening, people are recognizing that we  have mental health problems, 20 percent of the people in the country will  have a problem over their lifetime.  So, multiple it out, it's about 60  million people and we understand that half of those people don't get  treatment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MILLER:  So, we see results of a lot of it, in the news unfortunately, they  have to treated.  And the other thing that's happening which is good is  that people have gotten over the stigma of having a mental health person in  the family--</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Celebrities are coming forward about their illnesses, that sort  of --</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, the rock just came out --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  --taken some of the stigma away.</p><p>MILLER:  Exactly.  And we work with Herschel Walker, bless him who --  Herschel was a great, great football player and a rock of a man, like the  other Rock who just came out and Herschel like problems.  These are in  people's heads, not in their physical body and you -- and the thing that we  picked up on early was you can't be well, you -- if you're only well  medically unless you're well upstairs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>MILLER:  And people have not realized that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What can we do about it now?  I mean, even five-time  Grammy Winner Mariah Carey recently disclosing in People Magazine she  suffers from bipolar disorder.  Other singers and athletes also coming up  like Demi Lovato, Johnny Mandel --</p><p>MILLER:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- you mentioned Kevin Love.  What's the progress?  What can we  do about it?  Are they promising drugs out there?</p><p>MILLER:  It's not really the drugs, they have to -- if they're treated, if  they're seen earlier, then things can happen, psychologists, it's not only  drugs.  By the time you get to the drugs, perhaps they're in a -- they're  in a second stage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well that's right.  And the drugs can be really harmful by the  way.  Look at opioids, right, a recent study by the Institute for Human for  Human Data Science finds that opioid prescriptions actually fell last year  by 10 percent --</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- but the National Institute on Drug abuse found that 150  people a day are dying from opioid overdoes.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  But now there's pressure on doctors, that's the easy way.   People have pain, they give them opioid which does a short-term drug on the  pain but then they'll become addicted, so we can't do that.</p><p>So they're cutting back on that and they're using ibuprofen and Aleve and  this and that and they're finding out that it's helpful, more so than they  thought.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So where does the grow come from at Universal, let's call it  the next years?</p><p>MILLER:  Right.  Well number one, people are aging and we are building,  build a--we build hospital a year in acute care.  And they've been  spectacular.  We build in Southern California, we build in Henderson, in  Las Vegas.  There's tremendous demand.  </p><p>We also build in our psych division behavioral health and there's great  need for that and we're overseas in the U.K.  So we have three legs which I  always wanted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MILLER:  -- and all of them are growing.  And we have been at is as talked,  this will be our 40th year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations Al.</p><p>MILLER:  Thank you.  So people rely on us, they know that we do the right  thing and I know that we're concerned about the patients.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because- -</p><p>MILLER:  Patients first is our concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're living longer and with that, we're leading more in our  older years for sure.  </p><p>MILLER:  But I'm very happy about the fact that these -- you mentioned  Mandel, Dwayne, \"The Rock,\" we've had Herschel for years, are making it  understood in society now that this is just like a sickness.</p><p>If someone has a gallbladder problem, nobody thinks twice about getting it  treated.  \"Oh, my son had a gallbladder or broke his arm or whatever,\"  mental health should be in that category.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well it's taking a while because I don't know that we've  actually had the treatments out there for mental health as prevalent as  treatment trough other things.  So for example, autism, Alzheimer's, I mean  we're studying the brain right now more and more, to learn more about these  things.</p><p>But we know a lot more about diabetes, we know a lot more about cancer.  I  mean, that's the point.  </p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  But the ones you mentioned are the generative, et cetera.   I'm talking about younger people who are fighting bipolar,  It's a  complicated society, there's a lot of pressures and a lot of people have  all of these pressures and they turn into depression and anxiety.</p><p>And the thing that really troubles me because we're very involved with the  military and think a great deal of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MILLER:  They used to be two great institutions, one of them is the  military and the other was the FBI.  And so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't that a shame?  Isn't that a shame?</p><p>MILLER:  It is a shame.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MILLER:  It's a -- it is a shame.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Alan, thank you for coming in this morning.  </p><p>MILLER:  You're very welcome.  Great to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Alan Miller joining us there, Universal  Health Services.  </p><p>Coming up, Ford cars are dead, long live the SUV.  The auto maker is making  big changes that looked to drive the company into the future.</p><p>Plus, drive-through Chipotle after posting better than expected earnings.   The CEO is outlying changes as the band looks for a new direction there,  we've got it all after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Thursday, it is  Thursday, April 26th, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East  Coast.  The busiest day for earnings yet, among the top names reporting  their first quarter this morning, Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, those are  coming out after the bell, tonight.  And Southwest Airlines just reported  mixed results this morning.</p><p>Ford, meanwhile, making major line-up changes, get this, the automaker will  only sell two cars at dealerships as drivers favor trucks and SUVs, find  out which cars are staying on the lot.  Chipotle, in earnings winner, the  struggling restaurant chain is showing signs of a turn around, the  company's profit and same store sales, beating expectations.  </p><p>Broader markets, this morning, looking good, we are expecting a higher  opening for the broader averages, Dow industrials set to open up about 30  points, S&amp;P is up three points and the NASDAQ right now, up a half a  percent, that's 32 points higher.</p><p>The Dow, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday, lifted by a  big beat from Boeing, Boeing stocks was strong as a Dow component, it  lifted the Dow up about 60 points, a quarter percent higher.  The NASDAQ  was lower yesterday by a fraction.  In Europe this morning, we are looking  at money moving into stocks, FT 100, CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are  higher, even if just by a fraction.  </p><p>We are waiting on the European Central Bank decision this morning, that is  due out in the next hour, we will have the news for you as soon as it hits  the tape.  No change on rates expected, but we will be watching the ECB  President, Mario Draghi, comment and his news conference about what he says  about stimulus going forward.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The Shanghai Composite, worst  performer, down one and a third percent.  Targeting Trump supporters, a New  York City bar allowed to throw out patrons wearing Make America Great Again  hats, the outrage, coming up this morning.  And then from ugly to cool,  Adidas unveiling a dead shoe, how much it costs, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning, but first, this, another sign of  economic optimism, according to a new poll from Fox News, 43 percent of  Americans are happy with the economy, with nine percent calling it  excellent.  A Fox Business exclusive now, a new study from Bank of America  shows growing optimism among small business owners in America, 54 percent  of small business owners expect to see economic strengthening in the coming  year.  Joining us right now to talk more about that is Bank of America Head  of Small Business, Sharon Miller, Sharon, good to see you.</p><p>SHARON MILLER, HEAD, SMALL BUSINESS, BANK OF AMERICA:  Great to see you,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were the reasons that they were so optimistic?  Tell us  about this new outlook.</p><p>MILLER:  Well, tax reform was certainly a game-changer, we heard loud and  clear from our small business owners that they were very optimistic  following the tax reform and that's more money to invest back into their  business, whether it's hiring more people, buying more equipment, whatever  it may be, but it is definitely a game-changer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you wonder how long the runway this has, given the fact  that we've already seen a real impact from the tax cut plan, but it's  expected to keep having an impact over the year.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, I think the stock prices obviously  get revised immediately, but as far as small business, what is the outlook  in terms of how it changes this coming year?</p><p>MILLER:  Well, small business, it's a local business and so what we are  seeing across the United States is optimism.  The headline is that we've  seen more optimistic, people are very positive about the outlook in their  local economies as well as the national economy, and that's a good sign for  business ahead.</p><p>HEGSETH:  How often do you hear about regulation or the reduction thereof  and how significant that's been?</p><p>MILLER:  It is, I mean, it is significant.  The less bureaucracy you have,  the less red tapes, so to speak.  It's better for business and they are  able to be more efficient, they're able to get through and understand what  the impacts are on their business.  So this is a positive for small  business owners, it can be very complex and then trying to understand how  to run your business, on top of that, how to understand the regulations,  it's a lot for one person to take.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How does this optimism, though, translate into ramping up  economic growth in this country whether it's through hiring, raises or  investment in their businesses?</p><p>MILLER:  Well, we are seeing all of that.  The one thing that I would point  to, is there is a war for talent out there.  Small business owners, I talk  to them all the time, across the country, they want to hire, they want to  attract good employees, and the right employees that are quality and that  understand their business and can add value to them.  </p><p>And what's happening is it's just -- because of such a great economy and  the very low unemployment, we are not able to find qualified workers in the  small business camps.  And so you've got to look at benefits, you've got to  look at all sights -- sorts of other things to attract the right workers  into the small businesses.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, Sharon, we are seeing this surge in confidence and optimism  among the business owners, but generally, we haven't seen, over the last  year, a lot of loan growth or maybe not as much as we'd like to see, do you  see that changing now or are there reasons why we shouldn't be concerned  even if the loan growth isn't off the charts?</p><p>MILLER:  Well, I think there's -- you know, there's different segments with  loan growth.  And so in the small business face Bank of America, we are  seeing demand for lending.  Our lending is strong and I would say that, you  know, when small businesses get started, generally, they will start with  either personal savings, perhaps a credit card, and then they are able to  get more traditional financing.  </p><p>We also partner with community development financial institutions for these  small businesses that may not be eligible for traditional financing.  But  we are seeing demand both in our traditional lines and loans as well as our  health care, so lending to dentists, doctors, veterinarians.</p><p>HEGSETH:  Sharon, but not all small businesses are created equal, some  sectors are struggling, may not feel optimism, where do you see the most  optimism and what places are not?</p><p>MILLER:  Well, I think, in the technology section, and certainly, there was  a question in our survey that was all around, what do you think about  digital payments?  And half of our small business owners felt like over the  next five years, that's all they would be taking.  </p><p>So instead of checks and instead of the way we may pay traditionally today,  especially to small business in the local (INAUDIBLE) landscaper, you know  your dry cleaner.  They are talking about all digital payments which is,  you know, quite -- there's a trickle down there because there's people that  have to build those types of capabilities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you've got nearly one-third of all small businesses using  smart phones --</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  to process digital payments, that's interesting.  Are the small  businesses having their access to credit?  I mean, how is that going in  terms of business getting the credit that they need?  That was one issue  that Linda McMahon brought up when she joined us, the Small Business  Administrator, earlier in the week.  </p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  And there is access to capital, I mean, that's something  that we want to make sure they were out there, we're teaching people how to  get access to capital and what you need to do when you're starting a small  business, how you have to have revenues that are going to be able to repay  that loan, so access to capital can come in more ways than just a  traditional loan and there's education, there's training.  </p><p>We are very focused on women, we just announced, last week, the Institute  for Women's Entrepreneurship and Bank of America partnership with Cornell  University, this is all about our attempt to make sure that we're giving  the education, the training and the information necessary for people to get  access to capital.  Many people don't know how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, compare women start-ups to male start-ups, what's higher?</p><p>MILLER:  Women are starting businesses at twice the rate of men with half  the capital.  And so, it say, it's definitely a great opportunity for us to  partner.  We will be, in fact, at Times Square, this week.  We are posting  poster love for Small Business.  We want to make sure that, you know, if  you like a small business, go online, give a good review for them because  that's going to help them in the local economy. So there's a lot of  opportunity for us to support small businesses and it's good for the local  communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, what's a small business?  How do you identify that?</p><p>MILLER:  Less than five million in revenues and 100 employees or less, so  these are small businesses.  This is the heart of America.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They have to be sitting there, though (INAUDIBLE) requirement to  provide health insurance to go away which the government has yet to repeal  the employer mandate, we got rid of individual mandate.  Is that -- is that  on their wish list and high on it?</p><p>MILLER:  Listen, health care is the number one concern.  It continues to be  in every report.  We survey and every survey we take of small business  owners across the United States, it was number one concern, this time, too.   So the cost of health care, the complexity and a lot of other things, so  health care is definitely the top of the list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, they are using digital.  They are not feeling the  crypto craze, though, right?  That's also something we should point out.   There are two percent of small business owners believe crypto will be  relevant to them but aren't sure how.  Bitcoin has been all the buzz in  Wall Street, obviously, in some quarters.  It's not gaining traction for  small business.</p><p>MILLER:  No, it's not.  It's not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there, Sharon, great to see you.</p><p>MILLER:  Thank you, great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  We'll keep watching, Sharon  Miller, joining us there.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  supporters of President Trump can get the boot from a bar, that's the  ruling of a New York City judge, the outrage, coming up this morning.  And  then, forget dad jeans, Adidas is launching dad sneakers, but dad might  walk away when he sees the price of these no frills kicks, back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big news from Ford Motor, the company putting a  big part of its car business in the rear-view mirror.  Cheryl Casone with  the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  OK.  So, if you like Ford Sedans, you better get one before  they're all gone, Martha.  Ford says that they're going to stop making the  Fiesta sub-compact, the Fusion mid-sized Sedan, and the Tourist large  Sedan.  After that, Ford's only going to have two cars left in the line-up  -- the mustang, of course, and a new hatchback of the focus active.  The  plan is to introduce more trucks and SUVs, which have been more popular  with buyers, frankly.  Shares of Ford are down about 12 percent so far this  year.  </p><p>Well, Chipotle is looking at options in an effort to try and turn around  their business.  Brian Nickel, who's the company's news CEO says that  Chipotle is considering a few different things.  Maybe they're going to  franchise, maybe some new menu items, they're thinking about drive-throughs  now.  Shares up more than 10 percent in extended trading after their first- quarter results came in better than expected.  The stock is up 15 percent  so far this year.  They're in recovery mode.  </p><p>Well, get this.  So, this is one of those only-in-New-York-stories.   Supporters of President Trump can legally be thrown out of a bar because of  their political beliefs, that's according to a Manhattan judge who ruled in  favor of a that refuse to serve a man wearing a make America great hat.   The judge says, current laws don't protect against political  discrimination.  This happened just after President Trump's inauguration.   After the guy complained about room service, the Trump supporter says staff  told him that he wasn't welcome there anymore, yes. </p><p>And then there's this, Adidas is getting into the dad shoe craze because,  apparently, there's dad shoe craze out there.  They have a new sneaker  called the young one, which is reminiscent of the 1990s shoe.  It's got a  kind of a chunky design, the sole is thick, it's got suede, it's got nylon.   This is basically all the rage right now, Maria.  So, the retro shoe, if  you want to pay the price, $130.  So, to be a cool dad is not so cool and  cheap, but there you have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let's do a survey.  We got some cool dads on the set  right now. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's not get crazy.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>HEGSETH:  I mean, if you're wearing the dad shoe, I think you've given up  on life.  And it's not a good-looking shoe.  I'm sorry, Adidas.  I like  Adidas.  But all white is just too much for me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, that's not a cool dad shoe.  What do you think, James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know.  Wearing something that's specifically marketed as  the dad shoe, I'm not sure just how cool that really would be, but -- I  don't need it.  I tend to avoid exercise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you have an injury -- a running injury, there's a brand of  shoe called HOKA.  Do you know what I'm talking about?  H-O-K-A.  They're  big gigantic, chunky, and hideous.  They're terrific athletic shoes and  they're running shoes but they look kind of like that.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.  Well, you don't have to choose to wear them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're great shoes, by the way.  I was talking about the trend,  ugly, expensive tennis shoe, I just found a pair of Balenciaga women's  sneakers, they're only $900.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's Balenciaga.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In case anybody has a bathtub full of cash and is really stupid.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take a break on that note.  Coming up, the wait is  finally over.  It is NFL draft day on FOX.  We're taking you inside the  private NFL owners' meeting about national anthem protest.  Sports, is  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Lebron James does it again, another highlight to  add to James' real.  Jared Max with highlights.  Wild night in NBA Playoffs  last night, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Maria, the Cavaliers and the Pacers  were tied 2-2, in their first-round playoff series.  Tied 95-95 under 10  seconds to play.  Game five, Lebron, the stage is yours.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  James, two seconds, one second for the win.  </p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lebron James delivers.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Of course, Lebron scores 44, 15 to 15 from the foul line.  The  Pacers' Victor Oladipo said he should've -- gotten a goal-tending call at  the other end.  But you know, Lebron hit the three-point shot at the other  end.  Cavs up, 3-2.  </p><p>Lebron, not the highest scorer in the NBA Playoffs last night.  Russell  Westbrook was -- he had 45.  The Thunder trailed the Jazz by 25 points in  the third quarter, and then outscored Utah, 61-28, over the final 20.5  minutes.  They win by eight.  Thunder still alive, down 3-2.  </p><p>Former President George Herbert-Walker Bush has been moved out of an ICU  unit into a regular hospital room, and he is focused on basketball.  A  statement released says, \"President Bush naturally thanks everyone for  their prayers and good wishes.  He also wants to assure everyone that as  good as he feels now, he's more focused on the Houston Rockets closing out  their playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves than anything that  landed him into the hospital.\"  Well, President Bush should be smiling  today.  Houston Rockets won last night.  They eliminated the Timberwolves  in game five with ease, 122-104; 30 points for James Harden.  </p><p>For the first time, we can say the NFL draft kicks off tonight on Fox 8:00  Eastern Time, AT&amp;T stadium outside of Dallas, the draft will begin, the  Cleveland Browns select Pete Hegseth -- no, you to tune in to see what it's  going to be.  The Browns have the first and the fourth picks.  </p><p>The New York Times obtained an audio recording of a meeting that NFL owners  and select players last fall, after President Trump suggested that any  player who kneeled for national anthem should be fired, well, Bob Kraft,  owner of New England Patriots, who's reported to have given President Trump  a Super Bowl ring apparently isn't entirely on the president's side.  </p><p>According to the New York Times, Kraft was reportedly recorded saying at  the meeting: \"The problem we have is, we have a president who will use that  as fodder to do his mission that I don't feel is in the best interest of  America.\"  Robert Kraft says, \"it's divisive and it's horrible.\"  Over  three hours of audio recordings coming out at that the New York Times have  said to have listened to.  You can imagine some of the comments that, you  know, might've gone on in this meeting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this from a supporter.  I mean, Bob Kraft has been  supporter of the president.  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes, yes!  I mean, the whole meeting was supposed to be  confidential which, of course, never happens.  I'm surprised here that Bob  Kraft say that.  He was one of those that you felt like was probably  frustrated with the anthem protest and felt like the solution was to just  stand for the anthem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, he doesn't want lower ratings.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can tell you one of the problems was though, is fewer and  fewer players week after week were taking a knee during the national  anthem.  President Trump was still tweeting about it and drawing attention  to it and trying to wit people into a frenzy over it, when it was less of a  story if you were actually watching the game.  And I think that the owners  rightfully had problem with that.  </p><p>MAX:  Dagen, I think a lot of owners also found themselves in weird  position because a game of politics, no pun intended, but here's something  important from the president, but now they also have Rosters of 53.  Jerry  Jones found himself kneeling and then standing up -- almost like he didn't  know what to do.  All of a sudden, he was involved.  So, not everybody --  it was a first time for everybody.  Not that I'm giving him a pass, but I  wonder why the Democrat --  </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yet it was (INAUDIBLE) in the off season.  I mean, it still  remains an issue, the NFL won't tackle and hasn't tackled yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, has Colin Kaepernick gotten a job yet?  </p><p>MAX:  No.  The Seahawks, maybe.  Whoever is the 14th pick of the third  round.  Pie 3-14, gets free pizza for a year from Pizza Hut.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The problem with any owner taking Colin Kaepernick on at this  point is he's got a divisive figure, and it's not just for the fans, it's  even in the locker room -- it's a distraction.  </p><p>MAX:  You're paying more than $25.00 for baggage fees.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's it, it's distraction.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You need to focus on the game.  Again, the owners, what are you  going to do?  Tell all these men that they can't take a knee?  And that  essentially violates their first amendment rights, you can't do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared, thank you.  Jared Max.

MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  Here there ladies, good morning to you.  Thanks  so much Gerri.  Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26thm happy Thursday.  Your top  stories right now 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It is the busiest single day of earnings season so far, industry giants  like General Motors, Starbucks, Amazon, Microsoft all reporting their  quarterly results today.  Ahead of the earning splits, Futures indicating  higher opening for the broader averages.  Check it out, Dow Industrials up  about 30 points right now, it's a fractional move on a percentage basis.   So as is the S&amp;P500, the NASDAQ right now, up half a percent, 33 points  higher.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday lifted by Boeing's big  earnings beat.  Stock was strong.  In yesterday's closing session, the Dow  ended up 60 points, the S&amp;P was up five, and the NASDAQ was down a  fraction, three and a half points lower.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, we've got gains across the board.  Fractional move  but the FT-100 is up 12, CAC Quarante in Paris is up 24 and the DAX Index  up 21 points.  </p><p> Investors are waiting on the European Central Bank decision this morning,  that's due out in the next hour.  No change in rates expected but the focus  will be on the ECB President, Mario Draghi and his comments about the  Future stimulus during his news conference.  We'll bring you all the news  from Europe coming up.</p><p> In Asia Overnight markets were mixed, the Shanghai Composite down one and a  third percent, worst performer in China as you see.</p><p> And Facebook back on Wall Street's friends list, the stock soaring in the  premarket this morning due to strong first quarter results showing an  increase in daily users and monthly users despite the ongoing data scandal.   The stock at 107 and change right now, we're breaking down those numbers,  talk with Dan Niles, his number one position there coming up.</p><p> Another speed bump for Tesla to report, the new trouble for Elon Musk's  electric automaker as the key member of the autopilot team departs amid new  safety questions.  </p><p> Then from flamethrowers to fire breathers, Elon Musk reveals his latest  project, a cyborg dragon.  The first details on the wild new robot coming  up this morning.</p><p> And then walk a mile in dad shoes, Adidas unveils the perfect sneaker for  keeping that dad bod in top shape. </p><p> All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to talk  all about it, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  The Wall Street  Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman along with Iraq  and Afghanistan War Veteran, FOX News Contributor, Pete Hegseth is here.   Great to see you Pete.  </p><p> PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see -- if those are the  world's best sneakers, the world has gone mad.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p> HEGSETH:  They're OK but the best?  I don't know.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  The trend in cool sneakers is the uglier and  the more expensive.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Oh, really.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can find you a pair of $1,200 sneakers that certainly none of  your children would be caught wearing it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But can you press a button and order pizza from it?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  Actually, you know what --</p><p> HEGSETH:  That's true.  That's true.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have no sneakers (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Those shoes -- those -- I'm talking about sneakers so expensive,  they should come with their own brick pizza oven quite frankly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot going on this morning, biggest day in earnings so far.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, I think it's exciting to have the dad bod trend continue  but, yes, you -- expectation is so high for American business and American  business keeps beating them.  So we'll see again today if the Facebook  pattern continues to the rest of the techs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're talking about 18, 19 percent earnings growth for  the S&amp;P500 for the first quarter, same thing for 2018.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But with valuations going into this quarter, it has to be better  than perfect.  There is no such thing as 110 percent in terms of you can  deliver a 100 percent but they need to deliver more than that.  </p><p> One of the things that Facebook did yesterday and we'll get into it is they  up the buybacks.  So they're going to buyback an additional $9 billion in  shares adding to the $6 billion previously authorized.  So I think Facebook  management stepped back and said, \"We need to do something to reduce this  stock.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll see about that.  It is getting juiced this  morning, that's for sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's up pretty big.  Coming up this morning, joining the  conversation, the Chairman of the House Republican Conference and  Washington Congresswoman, Cathy McMorris Rodgers is with us.  California  Congressman, John Garamendi is here along with Alpha One Capital Partners  Founding Partner, Dan Niles who predicted a very good quarter for Facebook  by the way, he's going to weigh in on the numbers.  Plus, Universal Health  Services Founder and CEO, Alan Miller is with us as well.  Don't miss a  moment of it.  </p><p> We kick it off right here this hour with this, the technology earnings  blitz on Wall Street, investors are watching Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel  all ahead of their results after the bell tonight and it's going to be  important given what's been going on with tech.</p><p> Meanwhile, Facebook topped Wall Street expectations yesterday reporting  adjusted earnings of $1.69 a share, revenue coming in $11.97 billion.  It  is the technology titan's first earnings report since the user data crisis,  the stock is trading up this morning.  As you can see, up six and two- thirds percent or $10-1/2 a share, James Freeman, your reaction to the  Facebook news.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think it's probably sometimes difficult for people to  understand why a company can have all of these bad headlines and have its  business performing so well.  And I think it's a couple of things.</p><p> One is that while people are concerned about their data, they obviously  value what they get from Facebook in terms of the ability to communicate  with friends more than they're concerned about having to share information  about themselves.  The other issue is that even if regulation comes, big  incumbent in an industry tend to do fine.  We have a heavy regulated  situation, the barriers to entry, the smaller competitors go up, and the  new side of our paper had a story this week about an E.U. regulator going  out to California talking to the big tech companies about privacy  regulations.</p><p> She thought they were going to freak out and they said, \"No, we're good.\"   This regulation is always a bigger burden for the smaller competitors.  So  if it comes in the U.S., you worry about the next challenger to Facebook  more than Facebook. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting because even the company's total cost in  expenses were up 39 percent year-over-year in the first quarter but the  acceleration of expense growth is driven by other things, the anticipation  of regulation driven by security, content investment, and long-term bets  like IA.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Now they did say to expect higher expenses going forward  and some of that will be I'm sure having to deal with compliance and  political nuttiness side of Washington but the business is very healthy  because people despite their unease welcome the trade.  I give you my data,  you know all about me and then return, I get lots of services for free.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Especially young people.  Especially young people. </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So far, people think that way.</p><p> FREEMAN:  So far.  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he added 70 million monthly, uses a lot of what was  discovered about -- and by the way, people keep referring to this as the  Cambridge Analytica scandal at Facebook --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know, it's ridiculous.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is a scan -- this is a gross misuse and reckless disregard  for people's privacy in data literally for more than the last decade.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.  Let's go back to the Barrack Obama years and what -- he  was a master at mining all of the data.  And Facebook was like, \"Come on  in, here's all of our user information.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's go back --</p><p> HEGSETH:  And (INAUDIBLE) Facebook into the head of the curve.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well the -- it started even before that.  It started even before  President Obama won the White House the first go around.  It started back  in 2007.  The bigger -- so the question is --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But it was really effective for the Obama presidency.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In 2012 for sure.  So will Facebook user stick around?  Will the  user growth continue to go great guns the way it has?  And tell you, what  are the advertisers going to do?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And so far based on just anecdotal information and evidence that  the Wall Street Journal collected, Sheryl Sandberg said yesterday the  company hasn't seen a meaningful trend of advertisers leaving the platform  but it's still a wait and see.  Plus, the stock through yesterday's close  was down 18 percent from the record high in early February.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you get a boost this morning, it's still off nearly 20  percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well the advertisers aren't stupid, they want the 2.2 billion  users on them.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Of course.  And the 2.2 billion users are -- they may have been a  Few bad headlines but if you were logging on to Facebook yesterday, you're  logging on to Facebook today, they have been incredibly effective at  monetizing their business model.</p><p> And as James says, he's exactly right, they get to sit at the table with  the regulators which means they'll benefit and find a way to maneuver any  regulations coming down the pipe.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Diamond &amp; Silk are testifying this morning before the House  Judiciary Committee after saying that their conservative content on  Facebook was censored.  The Congressional panel also inviting  representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter to the hearing on social  media filtering practices and its effect on free speech.</p><p> Bottom line here, this is one of the issues that Congress is most upset  about and that they're going to be pressing --</p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- the fact that they are deciding what we see and what we  hear.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Uh-hmm.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's what Diamond &amp; Silk are going to be testifying about  today.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  It will be great TV I'll tell you that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HEGSETH:  I mean, they don't hold back, set your DVRs, I'm sure it will be  fascinating.  But they -- their finger is on the pulse of what I think is  the biggest concern for many Americans around Facebook, is my content being  blocked based on algorithm I'm not aware of?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> HEGSETH:  And is there an ideological slant to that algorithm and people --  they have a platform to speak out.  Most people who are speaking out don't  and have this sense that their content isn't reaching people, a big concern  for --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's why they don't get sued because they're supposed to be  the area that people from all different areas can talk and exchange ideas.</p><p> HEGSETH:  But they're not.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But they're -- they may not be, that's the issue.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But if you're pro-life and pro second amendment, your content  will be taken down quite frankly in some instances.  I've had friends --</p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's wrong.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've had friends that experience that.  There was an incident  that I believe Mark Zuckerberg was asked about when he testified in front  of Congress, it was a Catholic University's content of Jesus on the cross  was censored.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he did -- and he acted like -- he played dumb.  Maybe he  didn't know about that one instant.  But, again, they're trying to be more  transparent Facebook is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are they trying?  That's what I wanted to see, actually the  effort because I don't know about that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're trying to be -- they're trying to be more (INAUDIBLE)  until the users, what would trigger con -- basically content censorship.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think this is going to be an increasing issue.  I mean,  you celebrate these social media companies because they did disrupt media  in the sense that the New York Times doesn't have the political, cultural  power it used to given that everyone can communicate now.  But this is the  question, are they the new gatekeepers that are going to do what the yield  gatekeepers did in screening out opinions that don't agree with.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you a platform or are you a gatekeeper?  We got to talk  about former FBI Director Jim Comey, did anybody see that interview last  night?  I tweeted this, \"Wow, just wow.\"</p><p> His leaked memos, a catalyst for the special counsel investigation was more  widely shared than previously thought.  Source is telling FOX News that  Comey likely gave his documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald  and possibly another person, along with the Columbia law school professor.   Watch this as Comey tries to defend his actions of leaking the memos to the  professor last night in the CNN Town Hall, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think that there's any credence from the  president's claims that you broke the law when you released your memos?</p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  I don't.  That won't surprise you, I  don't.  In fact, I think he's just making stuff up.  I didn't leak memos, I  asked a friend to communicate the substance of one unclassified --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that it  would be out in the media, I wanted it to get in the media.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p> COMEY:  As a private citizen, I could do that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Just because you say you're not leaking, Dagen, doesn't mean  you're not leaking.  We're not idiots, OK?  We're not morons.  You actually  leaked a memo to your friend who's a professor, now you're saying, \"I  didn't leak it because I told him, \"Oh, get it to the New York Times, just  the content, don't give the actual paper.\"  I mean, this is -- I'm  outraged.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You just defined what the word leak means.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Does he think anyone is buying this?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He doesn't care if they're buy -- he only cares if they're  buying that book that he's written.  I tweeted last night, I said, \"To call  Washington, D.C. a bunch -- a snake pit is an insult to snakes.\"</p><p> FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He -- the -- what did he say, \"That I'm not a weasel\" that was  in the notes that were --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, he came off like such a weasel last night.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I don't know if he told the president I'm not a weasel.  Again,  by his actions, defining what weasel means.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Isn't that extraordinary though that --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's not funny actually.  I'm laughing --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's really not funny because he's taking advantage of this  platform that he has with this book tour and just ignoring facts.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Let him keep speaking.  Please, keep speaking.  Let us see more  documents, let the investigations continue because all it does is exonerate  the collusion and all of the narratives they have and expose the snake pit  for what it is.</p><p> He says, \"I'm a private citizen\" yet the day before you weren't and the  document you created isn't private and you have no right to leak it and the  fact that he did what he did, he's a leaking launderer, right?  He wanted  to launder his leaks through somebody else that he could write his  (INAUDIBLE) it's all absurd.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, the Wall Street Journal has been  writing about what a weasel this guy is --</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- literally since before 2003.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They warned President Obama not to appoint him as the FBI  Director, the y-- the editorial page at the Journal warned President Trump,   nothing (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> HEGSETH:  James, how did you know?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because if you go through the man's history, he abuses power,  there's prosecutorial overreach, he is not a boy scout, he is less than a  snake.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Thank you.  Now, that's the pattern overtime and you saw it with  the e-mail investigation, you saw it with him basically running a rough  shot over longstanding Justice Department policies, acting as if he's a  prosecutor, he's not -- his job, head of the FBI to investigate and a lot  of prosecutors to make the appropriate decisions.</p><p> So it's just over and over again not following the rules but it's funny,  when you play that clip, I haven't seen it before and he started describing  what he was doing --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- thought, \"Gee, that sounds a lot like leaking.\"  What am I  missing here?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But kudos to Anderson Cooper and he did the stick to  the fire on that question and say, \"But isn't that leaking over and over  again?\"  To me, that was such arrogance and then to go on all of these  shows and say the president is unfit to be president.</p><p> You're unfit to be FBI director.  I mean, that's what's really clear.  But  the arrogance is up there with -- remember Shkreli when he was playing  videogames in the courtroom, that's where this arrogance is, I equate the  same.</p><p> FREEMAN:  And confidence, I don't want to change the subject too much.  But  you look at the resources, is FBI devoted to enforcing the rules of college  basketball?  Meanwhile ignoring for example this horrendous scandal in  gymnastics that was going on at the same time.  I mean, there's a long list  of not just the ethical issues but the confidence issues when he was  running the FBI.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure is.  All right, thank you for that.  We're going to take a  break.  When we come back, a manhunt is underway this morning for a suspect  accused of killing a main police officer then stealing his police cruiser.   The latest on the search, plus a startling new statistic about how many of  our heroes have been killed already this year.</p><p> Plus, Tesla's rough ride ahead of the self-driving business quits amidst  continuing safety issues.  Meanwhile, Elon Musk announces a shocking new  robot venture, we've got all the details right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A cop killer is on the loose in Maine this  morning.  An urgent manhunt underway, Cheryl Casone with the details and  headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, this is John Williams.  They say the 29-year-old gun down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine, that is just  north of Augusta.  </p><p> Williams then drove the cruiser to a nearby convenient store and robbed it.   Police releasing this photo captured of him from inside of that stolen car.   He then abandoned the car nearby, he has not been seen since.  Deputy Cole  had been on the force for 13 years, he lives behind a son.  </p><p> The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot in a Dallas Home  Depot, one of those officers was killed.  Official Rogelio Santander died  from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him in the back of  the head while trying to make an arrest.  Twenty-two officers have been  shot and killed so far this year, that is more than double from the same  time last year.  On average, at least one officer reportedly has been shot  to death every week so far in 2018.</p><p> Well, Tesla suffering a major lost in its self-driving car program.  The  leader of that division has left the company.  Jim Keller has taken a job  at Intel making him the latest to the string of very high level departures  from Tesla.  The self-driving program under new scrutiny after a Model X  driver died using autopilot in a crash south of San Francisco last month.</p><p> Meanwhile, Elon Musk is already on to his next project, he casually tweeted  last night that he's building a cyborg dragon.  Yes, you heard me  correctly.  He didn't give us any more details, it's unclear what he plans  to do with the sci-fi robot but, yes, the cyborg dragon.  Shares of Tesla  Maria are lower in the premarket but he's going to build a cyborg dragon.   Well, I'll let you sponge on that one.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is that?  What's a cyborg dragon?  </p><p> CASONE:  We don't know, that's all he tweets.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's just a robot.</p><p> CASONE:  Oki-dokie, we'll look for that.  Fix your cars.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  Robots, take it over man.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just have to share this tweet from one of the viewers, Michael  Hutchins related to the Comey discussion.  Remember what George Costanza  told Jerry Seinfeld, \"It's not a lie if you believe it.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, again, it's turned into a Seinfeld episode.  I wanted to  pass that along.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well we'll see what the I.G. report says about Jim Comey and  the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation because that's going to be the  focus in the next I.G. report that's coming out in the month of May.  We  know what the earlier I.G. report, it recommended criminal charges against  Andrew McCabe.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes, absolutely.  And we were talking in between, the vast  difference between how James Comey has treated others and the treatment he  expects themselves, it is offensive on how he looks down to people in a  condescending way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It really is.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, good  news for the president, a new poll shows that Americans believe President  Trump's policies are helping the economy.  We're taking a closer look at  those policies and how they're giving small businesses a big boost.</p><p> Then George H.W. Boost is out of intensive care and his biggest concern,  the health of his beloved Houston Rockets, more on that coming up this  morning, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings alert, Universal Health Services  reporting after the bell last night.  Profit and revenue up from a year  ago.  The company is shy of analyst expectations.  However, the numbers  Universal reporting adjusted earnings of $2.45 a share on revenue of $2.69  billion.</p><p> Joining me right now is the Founder and CEO of Universal Health Services,  Alan Miller.  Alan, great to see you.</p><p> ALAN MILLER, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES:  Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  Characterize the quarter for  us, what went off?</p><p> MILLER:  Well, we have two big segments.  One segment outpace the industry,  the other segment is catching up.  We've had some issues of shortage of  doctors and nurses and a few other incidents, and we're in the U.K. which  is going really well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The hospital segment in general has been struggling because we  see that the needs will get bigger and consolidate within hospitals.  Do  you still see that?</p><p> MILLER:  Yes.  There's consolidation because the insurance companies don't  want to pay and they're finding all kinds of ways to deny payment even  after we provide the service.</p><p> So -- I mean, that's not a good basis for business.  So we're letting them  know about it, we're suing them if we have to.  But the demand is so great  that the business is just a very sound business.  And we are -- and have  been from the outset a pioneer in mental health and mental health now as  you well know, two things are happening, people are recognizing that we  have mental health problems, 20 percent of the people in the country will  have a problem over their lifetime.  So, multiple it out, it's about 60  million people and we understand that half of those people don't get  treatment.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> MILLER:  So, we see results of a lot of it, in the news unfortunately, they  have to treated.  And the other thing that's happening which is good is  that people have gotten over the stigma of having a mental health person in  the family--</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Celebrities are coming forward about their illnesses, that sort  of --</p><p> MILLER:  Yes, the rock just came out --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  --taken some of the stigma away.</p><p> MILLER:  Exactly.  And we work with Herschel Walker, bless him who --  Herschel was a great, great football player and a rock of a man, like the  other Rock who just came out and Herschel like problems.  These are in  people's heads, not in their physical body and you -- and the thing that we  picked up on early was you can't be well, you -- if you're only well  medically unless you're well upstairs --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p> MILLER:  And people have not realized that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What can we do about it now?  I mean, even five-time  Grammy Winner Mariah Carey recently disclosing in People Magazine she  suffers from bipolar disorder.  Other singers and athletes also coming up  like Demi Lovato, Johnny Mandel --</p><p> MILLER:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- you mentioned Kevin Love.  What's the progress?  What can we  do about it?  Are they promising drugs out there?</p><p> MILLER:  It's not really the drugs, they have to -- if they're treated, if  they're seen earlier, then things can happen, psychologists, it's not only  drugs.  By the time you get to the drugs, perhaps they're in a -- they're  in a second stage.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well that's right.  And the drugs can be really harmful by the  way.  Look at opioids, right, a recent study by the Institute for Human for  Human Data Science finds that opioid prescriptions actually fell last year  by 10 percent --</p><p> MILLER:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- but the National Institute on Drug abuse found that 150  people a day are dying from opioid overdoes.</p><p> MILLER:  Yes.  But now there's pressure on doctors, that's the easy way.   People have pain, they give them opioid which does a short-term drug on the  pain but then they'll become addicted, so we can't do that.</p><p> So they're cutting back on that and they're using ibuprofen and Aleve and  this and that and they're finding out that it's helpful, more so than they  thought.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So where does the grow come from at Universal, let's call it  the next years?</p><p> MILLER:  Right.  Well number one, people are aging and we are building,  build a--we build hospital a year in acute care.  And they've been  spectacular.  We build in Southern California, we build in Henderson, in  Las Vegas.  There's tremendous demand.  </p><p> We also build in our psych division behavioral health and there's great  need for that and we're overseas in the U.K.  So we have three legs which I  always wanted --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MILLER:  -- and all of them are growing.  And we have been at is as talked,  this will be our 40th year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congratulations Al.</p><p> MILLER:  Thank you.  So people rely on us, they know that we do the right  thing and I know that we're concerned about the patients.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, because- -</p><p> MILLER:  Patients first is our concern.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're living longer and with that, we're leading more in our  older years for sure.  </p><p> MILLER:  But I'm very happy about the fact that these -- you mentioned  Mandel, Dwayne, \"The Rock,\" we've had Herschel for years, are making it  understood in society now that this is just like a sickness.</p><p> If someone has a gallbladder problem, nobody thinks twice about getting it  treated.  \"Oh, my son had a gallbladder or broke his arm or whatever,\"  mental health should be in that category.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well it's taking a while because I don't know that we've  actually had the treatments out there for mental health as prevalent as  treatment trough other things.  So for example, autism, Alzheimer's, I mean  we're studying the brain right now more and more, to learn more about these  things.</p><p> But we know a lot more about diabetes, we know a lot more about cancer.  I  mean, that's the point.  </p><p> MILLER:  Yes.  But the ones you mentioned are the generative, et cetera.   I'm talking about younger people who are fighting bipolar,  It's a  complicated society, there's a lot of pressures and a lot of people have  all of these pressures and they turn into depression and anxiety.</p><p> And the thing that really troubles me because we're very involved with the  military and think a great deal of them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MILLER:  They used to be two great institutions, one of them is the  military and the other was the FBI.  And so --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Isn't that a shame?  Isn't that a shame?</p><p> MILLER:  It is a shame.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MILLER:  It's a -- it is a shame.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Alan, thank you for coming in this morning.  </p><p> MILLER:  You're very welcome.  Great to see you again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Alan Miller joining us there, Universal  Health Services.  </p><p> Coming up, Ford cars are dead, long live the SUV.  The auto maker is making  big changes that looked to drive the company into the future.</p><p> Plus, drive-through Chipotle after posting better than expected earnings.   The CEO is outlying changes as the band looks for a new direction there,  we've got it all after this break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Thursday, it is  Thursday, April 26th, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East  Coast.  The busiest day for earnings yet, among the top names reporting  their first quarter this morning, Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, those are  coming out after the bell, tonight.  And Southwest Airlines just reported  mixed results this morning.</p><p> Ford, meanwhile, making major line-up changes, get this, the automaker will  only sell two cars at dealerships as drivers favor trucks and SUVs, find  out which cars are staying on the lot.  Chipotle, in earnings winner, the  struggling restaurant chain is showing signs of a turn around, the  company's profit and same store sales, beating expectations.  </p><p> Broader markets, this morning, looking good, we are expecting a higher  opening for the broader averages, Dow industrials set to open up about 30  points, S&amp;P is up three points and the NASDAQ right now, up a half a  percent, that's 32 points higher.</p><p> The Dow, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday, lifted by a  big beat from Boeing, Boeing stocks was strong as a Dow component, it  lifted the Dow up about 60 points, a quarter percent higher.  The NASDAQ  was lower yesterday by a fraction.  In Europe this morning, we are looking  at money moving into stocks, FT 100, CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are  higher, even if just by a fraction.  </p><p> We are waiting on the European Central Bank decision this morning, that is  due out in the next hour, we will have the news for you as soon as it hits  the tape.  No change on rates expected, but we will be watching the ECB  President, Mario Draghi, comment and his news conference about what he says  about stimulus going forward.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The Shanghai Composite, worst  performer, down one and a third percent.  Targeting Trump supporters, a New  York City bar allowed to throw out patrons wearing Make America Great Again  hats, the outrage, coming up this morning.  And then from ugly to cool,  Adidas unveiling a dead shoe, how much it costs, coming up.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning, but first, this, another sign of  economic optimism, according to a new poll from Fox News, 43 percent of  Americans are happy with the economy, with nine percent calling it  excellent.  A Fox Business exclusive now, a new study from Bank of America  shows growing optimism among small business owners in America, 54 percent  of small business owners expect to see economic strengthening in the coming  year.  Joining us right now to talk more about that is Bank of America Head  of Small Business, Sharon Miller, Sharon, good to see you.</p><p> SHARON MILLER, HEAD, SMALL BUSINESS, BANK OF AMERICA:  Great to see you,  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What were the reasons that they were so optimistic?  Tell us  about this new outlook.</p><p> MILLER:  Well, tax reform was certainly a game-changer, we heard loud and  clear from our small business owners that they were very optimistic  following the tax reform and that's more money to invest back into their  business, whether it's hiring more people, buying more equipment, whatever  it may be, but it is definitely a game-changer.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you wonder how long the runway this has, given the fact  that we've already seen a real impact from the tax cut plan, but it's  expected to keep having an impact over the year.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, I think the stock prices obviously  get revised immediately, but as far as small business, what is the outlook  in terms of how it changes this coming year?</p><p> MILLER:  Well, small business, it's a local business and so what we are  seeing across the United States is optimism.  The headline is that we've  seen more optimistic, people are very positive about the outlook in their  local economies as well as the national economy, and that's a good sign for  business ahead.</p><p> HEGSETH:  How often do you hear about regulation or the reduction thereof  and how significant that's been?</p><p> MILLER:  It is, I mean, it is significant.  The less bureaucracy you have,  the less red tapes, so to speak.  It's better for business and they are  able to be more efficient, they're able to get through and understand what  the impacts are on their business.  So this is a positive for small  business owners, it can be very complex and then trying to understand how  to run your business, on top of that, how to understand the regulations,  it's a lot for one person to take.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How does this optimism, though, translate into ramping up  economic growth in this country whether it's through hiring, raises or  investment in their businesses?</p><p> MILLER:  Well, we are seeing all of that.  The one thing that I would point  to, is there is a war for talent out there.  Small business owners, I talk  to them all the time, across the country, they want to hire, they want to  attract good employees, and the right employees that are quality and that  understand their business and can add value to them.  </p><p> And what's happening is it's just -- because of such a great economy and  the very low unemployment, we are not able to find qualified workers in the  small business camps.  And so you've got to look at benefits, you've got to  look at all sights -- sorts of other things to attract the right workers  into the small businesses.</p><p> FREEMAN:  So, Sharon, we are seeing this surge in confidence and optimism  among the business owners, but generally, we haven't seen, over the last  year, a lot of loan growth or maybe not as much as we'd like to see, do you  see that changing now or are there reasons why we shouldn't be concerned  even if the loan growth isn't off the charts?</p><p> MILLER:  Well, I think there's -- you know, there's different segments with  loan growth.  And so in the small business face Bank of America, we are  seeing demand for lending.  Our lending is strong and I would say that, you  know, when small businesses get started, generally, they will start with  either personal savings, perhaps a credit card, and then they are able to  get more traditional financing.  </p><p> We also partner with community development financial institutions for these  small businesses that may not be eligible for traditional financing.  But  we are seeing demand both in our traditional lines and loans as well as our  health care, so lending to dentists, doctors, veterinarians.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Sharon, but not all small businesses are created equal, some  sectors are struggling, may not feel optimism, where do you see the most  optimism and what places are not?</p><p> MILLER:  Well, I think, in the technology section, and certainly, there was  a question in our survey that was all around, what do you think about  digital payments?  And half of our small business owners felt like over the  next five years, that's all they would be taking.  </p><p> So instead of checks and instead of the way we may pay traditionally today,  especially to small business in the local (INAUDIBLE) landscaper, you know  your dry cleaner.  They are talking about all digital payments which is,  you know, quite -- there's a trickle down there because there's people that  have to build those types of capabilities.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you've got nearly one-third of all small businesses using  smart phones --</p><p> MILLER:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  to process digital payments, that's interesting.  Are the small  businesses having their access to credit?  I mean, how is that going in  terms of business getting the credit that they need?  That was one issue  that Linda McMahon brought up when she joined us, the Small Business  Administrator, earlier in the week.  </p><p> MILLER:  Yes.  And there is access to capital, I mean, that's something  that we want to make sure they were out there, we're teaching people how to  get access to capital and what you need to do when you're starting a small  business, how you have to have revenues that are going to be able to repay  that loan, so access to capital can come in more ways than just a  traditional loan and there's education, there's training.  </p><p> We are very focused on women, we just announced, last week, the Institute  for Women's Entrepreneurship and Bank of America partnership with Cornell  University, this is all about our attempt to make sure that we're giving  the education, the training and the information necessary for people to get  access to capital.  Many people don't know how to do it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, compare women start-ups to male start-ups, what's higher?</p><p> MILLER:  Women are starting businesses at twice the rate of men with half  the capital.  And so, it say, it's definitely a great opportunity for us to  partner.  We will be, in fact, at Times Square, this week.  We are posting  poster love for Small Business.  We want to make sure that, you know, if  you like a small business, go online, give a good review for them because  that's going to help them in the local economy. So there's a lot of  opportunity for us to support small businesses and it's good for the local  communities.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  By the way, what's a small business?  How do you identify that?</p><p> MILLER:  Less than five million in revenues and 100 employees or less, so  these are small businesses.  This is the heart of America.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They have to be sitting there, though (INAUDIBLE) requirement to  provide health insurance to go away which the government has yet to repeal  the employer mandate, we got rid of individual mandate.  Is that -- is that  on their wish list and high on it?</p><p> MILLER:  Listen, health care is the number one concern.  It continues to be  in every report.  We survey and every survey we take of small business  owners across the United States, it was number one concern, this time, too.   So the cost of health care, the complexity and a lot of other things, so  health care is definitely the top of the list.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  By the way, they are using digital.  They are not feeling the  crypto craze, though, right?  That's also something we should point out.   There are two percent of small business owners believe crypto will be  relevant to them but aren't sure how.  Bitcoin has been all the buzz in  Wall Street, obviously, in some quarters.  It's not gaining traction for  small business.</p><p> MILLER:  No, it's not.  It's not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there, Sharon, great to see you.</p><p> MILLER:  Thank you, great to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  We'll keep watching, Sharon  Miller, joining us there.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  supporters of President Trump can get the boot from a bar, that's the  ruling of a New York City judge, the outrage, coming up this morning.  And  then, forget dad jeans, Adidas is launching dad sneakers, but dad might  walk away when he sees the price of these no frills kicks, back in a  minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big news from Ford Motor, the company putting a  big part of its car business in the rear-view mirror.  Cheryl Casone with  the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  OK.  So, if you like Ford Sedans, you better get one before  they're all gone, Martha.  Ford says that they're going to stop making the  Fiesta sub-compact, the Fusion mid-sized Sedan, and the Tourist large  Sedan.  After that, Ford's only going to have two cars left in the line-up  -- the mustang, of course, and a new hatchback of the focus active.  The  plan is to introduce more trucks and SUVs, which have been more popular  with buyers, frankly.  Shares of Ford are down about 12 percent so far this  year.  </p><p> Well, Chipotle is looking at options in an effort to try and turn around  their business.  Brian Nickel, who's the company's news CEO says that  Chipotle is considering a few different things.  Maybe they're going to  franchise, maybe some new menu items, they're thinking about drive-throughs  now.  Shares up more than 10 percent in extended trading after their first- quarter results came in better than expected.  The stock is up 15 percent  so far this year.  They're in recovery mode.  </p><p> Well, get this.  So, this is one of those only-in-New-York-stories.   Supporters of President Trump can legally be thrown out of a bar because of  their political beliefs, that's according to a Manhattan judge who ruled in  favor of a that refuse to serve a man wearing a make America great hat.   The judge says, current laws don't protect against political  discrimination.  This happened just after President Trump's inauguration.   After the guy complained about room service, the Trump supporter says staff  told him that he wasn't welcome there anymore, yes. </p><p> And then there's this, Adidas is getting into the dad shoe craze because,  apparently, there's dad shoe craze out there.  They have a new sneaker  called the young one, which is reminiscent of the 1990s shoe.  It's got a  kind of a chunky design, the sole is thick, it's got suede, it's got nylon.   This is basically all the rage right now, Maria.  So, the retro shoe, if  you want to pay the price, $130.  So, to be a cool dad is not so cool and  cheap, but there you have it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, let's do a survey.  We got some cool dads on the set  right now. </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's not get crazy.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> HEGSETH:  I mean, if you're wearing the dad shoe, I think you've given up  on life.  And it's not a good-looking shoe.  I'm sorry, Adidas.  I like  Adidas.  But all white is just too much for me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, that's not a cool dad shoe.  What do you think, James?</p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't know.  Wearing something that's specifically marketed as  the dad shoe, I'm not sure just how cool that really would be, but -- I  don't need it.  I tend to avoid exercise.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you have an injury -- a running injury, there's a brand of  shoe called HOKA.  Do you know what I'm talking about?  H-O-K-A.  They're  big gigantic, chunky, and hideous.  They're terrific athletic shoes and  they're running shoes but they look kind of like that.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes.  Well, you don't have to choose to wear them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're great shoes, by the way.  I was talking about the trend,  ugly, expensive tennis shoe, I just found a pair of Balenciaga women's  sneakers, they're only $900.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's Balenciaga.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  In case anybody has a bathtub full of cash and is really stupid.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will take a break on that note.  Coming up, the wait is  finally over.  It is NFL draft day on FOX.  We're taking you inside the  private NFL owners' meeting about national anthem protest.  Sports, is  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Lebron James does it again, another highlight to  add to James' real.  Jared Max with highlights.  Wild night in NBA Playoffs  last night, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Maria, the Cavaliers and the Pacers  were tied 2-2, in their first-round playoff series.  Tied 95-95 under 10  seconds to play.  Game five, Lebron, the stage is yours.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (CROWD CHEERING)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  James, two seconds, one second for the win.  </p><p> (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lebron James delivers.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MAX:  Of course, Lebron scores 44, 15 to 15 from the foul line.  The  Pacers' Victor Oladipo said he should've -- gotten a goal-tending call at  the other end.  But you know, Lebron hit the three-point shot at the other  end.  Cavs up, 3-2.  </p><p> Lebron, not the highest scorer in the NBA Playoffs last night.  Russell  Westbrook was -- he had 45.  The Thunder trailed the Jazz by 25 points in  the third quarter, and then outscored Utah, 61-28, over the final 20.5  minutes.  They win by eight.  Thunder still alive, down 3-2.  </p><p> Former President George Herbert-Walker Bush has been moved out of an ICU  unit into a regular hospital room, and he is focused on basketball.  A  statement released says, \"President Bush naturally thanks everyone for  their prayers and good wishes.  He also wants to assure everyone that as  good as he feels now, he's more focused on the Houston Rockets closing out  their playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves than anything that  landed him into the hospital.\"  Well, President Bush should be smiling  today.  Houston Rockets won last night.  They eliminated the Timberwolves  in game five with ease, 122-104; 30 points for James Harden.  </p><p> For the first time, we can say the NFL draft kicks off tonight on Fox 8:00  Eastern Time, AT&amp;T stadium outside of Dallas, the draft will begin, the  Cleveland Browns select Pete Hegseth -- no, you to tune in to see what it's  going to be.  The Browns have the first and the fourth picks.  </p><p> The New York Times obtained an audio recording of a meeting that NFL owners  and select players last fall, after President Trump suggested that any  player who kneeled for national anthem should be fired, well, Bob Kraft,  owner of New England Patriots, who's reported to have given President Trump  a Super Bowl ring apparently isn't entirely on the president's side.  </p><p> According to the New York Times, Kraft was reportedly recorded saying at  the meeting: \"The problem we have is, we have a president who will use that  as fodder to do his mission that I don't feel is in the best interest of  America.\"  Robert Kraft says, \"it's divisive and it's horrible.\"  Over  three hours of audio recordings coming out at that the New York Times have  said to have listened to.  You can imagine some of the comments that, you  know, might've gone on in this meeting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this from a supporter.  I mean, Bob Kraft has been  supporter of the president.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes, yes!  I mean, the whole meeting was supposed to be  confidential which, of course, never happens.  I'm surprised here that Bob  Kraft say that.  He was one of those that you felt like was probably  frustrated with the anthem protest and felt like the solution was to just  stand for the anthem.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, he doesn't want lower ratings.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can tell you one of the problems was though, is fewer and  fewer players week after week were taking a knee during the national  anthem.  President Trump was still tweeting about it and drawing attention  to it and trying to wit people into a frenzy over it, when it was less of a  story if you were actually watching the game.  And I think that the owners  rightfully had problem with that.  </p><p> MAX:  Dagen, I think a lot of owners also found themselves in weird  position because a game of politics, no pun intended, but here's something  important from the president, but now they also have Rosters of 53.  Jerry  Jones found himself kneeling and then standing up -- almost like he didn't  know what to do.  All of a sudden, he was involved.  So, not everybody --  it was a first time for everybody.  Not that I'm giving him a pass, but I  wonder why the Democrat --  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Yet it was (INAUDIBLE) in the off season.  I mean, it still  remains an issue, the NFL won't tackle and hasn't tackled yet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, has Colin Kaepernick gotten a job yet?  </p><p> MAX:  No.  The Seahawks, maybe.  Whoever is the 14th pick of the third  round.  Pie 3-14, gets free pizza for a year from Pizza Hut.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The problem with any owner taking Colin Kaepernick on at this  point is he's got a divisive figure, and it's not just for the fans, it's  even in the locker room -- it's a distraction.  </p><p> MAX:  You're paying more than $25.00 for baggage fees.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's it, it's distraction.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You need to focus on the game.  Again, the owners, what are you  going to do?  Tell all these men that they can't take a knee?  And that  essentially violates their first amendment rights, you can't do that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jared, thank you.  Jared Max.

MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  Here there ladies, good morning to you.  Thanks  so much Gerri.  Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 26thm happy Thursday.  Your top  stories right now 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It is the busiest single day of earnings season so far, industry giants  like General Motors, Starbucks, Amazon, Microsoft all reporting their  quarterly results today.  Ahead of the earning splits, Futures indicating  higher opening for the broader averages.  Check it out, Dow Industrials up  about 30 points right now, it's a fractional move on a percentage basis.   So as is the S&amp;P500, the NASDAQ right now, up half a percent, 33 points  higher.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday lifted by Boeing's big  earnings beat.  Stock was strong.  In yesterday's closing session, the Dow  ended up 60 points, the S&amp;P was up five, and the NASDAQ was down a  fraction, three and a half points lower.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, we've got gains across the board.  Fractional move  but the FT-100 is up 12, CAC Quarante in Paris is up 24 and the DAX Index  up 21 points.  </p><p> Investors are waiting on the European Central Bank decision this morning,  that's due out in the next hour.  No change in rates expected but the focus  will be on the ECB President, Mario Draghi and his comments about the  Future stimulus during his news conference.  We'll bring you all the news  from Europe coming up.</p><p> In Asia Overnight markets were mixed, the Shanghai Composite down one and a  third percent, worst performer in China as you see.</p><p> And Facebook back on Wall Street's friends list, the stock soaring in the  premarket this morning due to strong first quarter results showing an  increase in daily users and monthly users despite the ongoing data scandal.   The stock at 107 and change right now, we're breaking down those numbers,  talk with Dan Niles, his number one position there coming up.</p><p> Another speed bump for Tesla to report, the new trouble for Elon Musk's  electric automaker as the key member of the autopilot team departs amid new  safety questions.  </p><p> Then from flamethrowers to fire breathers, Elon Musk reveals his latest  project, a cyborg dragon.  The first details on the wild new robot coming  up this morning.</p><p> And then walk a mile in dad shoes, Adidas unveils the perfect sneaker for  keeping that dad bod in top shape. </p><p> All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to talk  all about it, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  The Wall Street  Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman along with Iraq  and Afghanistan War Veteran, FOX News Contributor, Pete Hegseth is here.   Great to see you Pete.  </p><p> PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see -- if those are the  world's best sneakers, the world has gone mad.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p> HEGSETH:  They're OK but the best?  I don't know.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  The trend in cool sneakers is the uglier and  the more expensive.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Oh, really.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can find you a pair of $1,200 sneakers that certainly none of  your children would be caught wearing it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But can you press a button and order pizza from it?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  Actually, you know what --</p><p> HEGSETH:  That's true.  That's true.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have no sneakers (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Those shoes -- those -- I'm talking about sneakers so expensive,  they should come with their own brick pizza oven quite frankly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot going on this morning, biggest day in earnings so far.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, I think it's exciting to have the dad bod trend continue  but, yes, you -- expectation is so high for American business and American  business keeps beating them.  So we'll see again today if the Facebook  pattern continues to the rest of the techs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're talking about 18, 19 percent earnings growth for  the S&amp;P500 for the first quarter, same thing for 2018.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But with valuations going into this quarter, it has to be better  than perfect.  There is no such thing as 110 percent in terms of you can  deliver a 100 percent but they need to deliver more than that.  </p><p> One of the things that Facebook did yesterday and we'll get into it is they  up the buybacks.  So they're going to buyback an additional $9 billion in  shares adding to the $6 billion previously authorized.  So I think Facebook  management stepped back and said, \"We need to do something to reduce this  stock.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll see about that.  It is getting juiced this  morning, that's for sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's up pretty big.  Coming up this morning, joining the  conversation, the Chairman of the House Republican Conference and  Washington Congresswoman, Cathy McMorris Rodgers is with us.  California  Congressman, John Garamendi is here along with Alpha One Capital Partners  Founding Partner, Dan Niles who predicted a very good quarter for Facebook  by the way, he's going to weigh in on the numbers.  Plus, Universal Health  Services Founder and CEO, Alan Miller is with us as well.  Don't miss a  moment of it.  </p><p> We kick it off right here this hour with this, the technology earnings  blitz on Wall Street, investors are watching Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel  all ahead of their results after the bell tonight and it's going to be  important given what's been going on with tech.</p><p> Meanwhile, Facebook topped Wall Street expectations yesterday reporting  adjusted earnings of $1.69 a share, revenue coming in $11.97 billion.  It  is the technology titan's first earnings report since the user data crisis,  the stock is trading up this morning.  As you can see, up six and two- thirds percent or $10-1/2 a share, James Freeman, your reaction to the  Facebook news.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think it's probably sometimes difficult for people to  understand why a company can have all of these bad headlines and have its  business performing so well.  And I think it's a couple of things.</p><p> One is that while people are concerned about their data, they obviously  value what they get from Facebook in terms of the ability to communicate  with friends more than they're concerned about having to share information  about themselves.  The other issue is that even if regulation comes, big  incumbent in an industry tend to do fine.  We have a heavy regulated  situation, the barriers to entry, the smaller competitors go up, and the  new side of our paper had a story this week about an E.U. regulator going  out to California talking to the big tech companies about privacy  regulations.</p><p> She thought they were going to freak out and they said, \"No, we're good.\"   This regulation is always a bigger burden for the smaller competitors.  So  if it comes in the U.S., you worry about the next challenger to Facebook  more than Facebook. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting because even the company's total cost in  expenses were up 39 percent year-over-year in the first quarter but the  acceleration of expense growth is driven by other things, the anticipation  of regulation driven by security, content investment, and long-term bets  like IA.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Now they did say to expect higher expenses going forward  and some of that will be I'm sure having to deal with compliance and  political nuttiness side of Washington but the business is very healthy  because people despite their unease welcome the trade.  I give you my data,  you know all about me and then return, I get lots of services for free.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Especially young people.  Especially young people. </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So far, people think that way.</p><p> FREEMAN:  So far.  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he added 70 million monthly, uses a lot of what was  discovered about -- and by the way, people keep referring to this as the  Cambridge Analytica scandal at Facebook --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know, it's ridiculous.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is a scan -- this is a gross misuse and reckless disregard  for people's privacy in data literally for more than the last decade.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.  Let's go back to the Barrack Obama years and what -- he  was a master at mining all of the data.  And Facebook was like, \"Come on  in, here's all of our user information.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's go back --</p><p> HEGSETH:  And (INAUDIBLE) Facebook into the head of the curve.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well the -- it started even before that.  It started even before  President Obama won the White House the first go around.  It started back  in 2007.  The bigger -- so the question is --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But it was really effective for the Obama presidency.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In 2012 for sure.  So will Facebook user stick around?  Will the  user growth continue to go great guns the way it has?  And tell you, what  are the advertisers going to do?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And so far based on just anecdotal information and evidence that  the Wall Street Journal collected, Sheryl Sandberg said yesterday the  company hasn't seen a meaningful trend of advertisers leaving the platform  but it's still a wait and see.  Plus, the stock through yesterday's close  was down 18 percent from the record high in early February.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you get a boost this morning, it's still off nearly 20  percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well the advertisers aren't stupid, they want the 2.2 billion  users on them.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Of course.  And the 2.2 billion users are -- they may have been a  Few bad headlines but if you were logging on to Facebook yesterday, you're  logging on to Facebook today, they have been incredibly effective at  monetizing their business model.</p><p> And as James says, he's exactly right, they get to sit at the table with  the regulators which means they'll benefit and find a way to maneuver any  regulations coming down the pipe.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Diamond &amp; Silk are testifying this morning before the House  Judiciary Committee after saying that their conservative content on  Facebook was censored.  The Congressional panel also inviting  representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter to the hearing on social  media filtering practices and its effect on free speech.</p><p> Bottom line here, this is one of the issues that Congress is most upset  about and that they're going to be pressing --</p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- the fact that they are deciding what we see and what we  hear.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Uh-hmm.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's what Diamond &amp; Silk are going to be testifying about  today.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  It will be great TV I'll tell you that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HEGSETH:  I mean, they don't hold back, set your DVRs, I'm sure it will be  fascinating.  But they -- their finger is on the pulse of what I think is  the biggest concern for many Americans around Facebook, is my content being  blocked based on algorithm I'm not aware of?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> HEGSETH:  And is there an ideological slant to that algorithm and people --  they have a platform to speak out.  Most people who are speaking out don't  and have this sense that their content isn't reaching people, a big concern  for --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's why they don't get sued because they're supposed to be  the area that people from all different areas can talk and exchange ideas.</p><p> HEGSETH:  But they're not.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But they're -- they may not be, that's the issue.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But if you're pro-life and pro second amendment, your content  will be taken down quite frankly in some instances.  I've had friends --</p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's wrong.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've had friends that experience that.  There was an incident  that I believe Mark Zuckerberg was asked about when he testified in front  of Congress, it was a Catholic University's content of Jesus on the cross  was censored.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he did -- and he acted like -- he played dumb.  Maybe he  didn't know about that one instant.  But, again, they're trying to be more  transparent Facebook is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are they trying?  That's what I wanted to see, actually the  effort because I don't know about that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're trying to be -- they're trying to be more (INAUDIBLE)  until the users, what would trigger con -- basically content censorship.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think this is going to be an increasing issue.  I mean,  you celebrate these social media companies because they did disrupt media  in the sense that the New York Times doesn't have the political, cultural  power it used to given that everyone can communicate now.  But this is the  question, are they the new gatekeepers that are going to do what the yield  gatekeepers did in screening out opinions that don't agree with.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you a platform or are you a gatekeeper?  We got to talk  about former FBI Director Jim Comey, did anybody see that interview last  night?  I tweeted this, \"Wow, just wow.\"</p><p> His leaked memos, a catalyst for the special counsel investigation was more  widely shared than previously thought.  Source is telling FOX News that  Comey likely gave his documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald  and possibly another person, along with the Columbia law school professor.   Watch this as Comey tries to defend his actions of leaking the memos to the  professor last night in the CNN Town Hall, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think that there's any credence from the  president's claims that you broke the law when you released your memos?</p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  I don't.  That won't surprise you, I  don't.  In fact, I think he's just making stuff up.  I didn't leak memos, I  asked a friend to communicate the substance of one unclassified --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> COMEY:  I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that it  would be out in the media, I wanted it to get in the media.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p> COMEY:  As a private citizen, I could do that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Just because you say you're not leaking, Dagen, doesn't mean  you're not leaking.  We're not idiots, OK?  We're not morons.  You actually  leaked a memo to your friend who's a professor, now you're saying, \"I  didn't leak it because I told him, \"Oh, get it to the New York Times, just  the content, don't give the actual paper.\"  I mean, this is -- I'm  outraged.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You just defined what the word leak means.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Does he think anyone is buying this?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He doesn't care if they're buy -- he only cares if they're  buying that book that he's written.  I tweeted last night, I said, \"To call  Washington, D.C. a bunch -- a snake pit is an insult to snakes.\"</p><p> FREEMAN:  Uh-hmm.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He -- the -- what did he say, \"That I'm not a weasel\" that was  in the notes that were --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, he came off like such a weasel last night.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I don't know if he told the president I'm not a weasel.  Again,  by his actions, defining what weasel means.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Isn't that extraordinary though that --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's not funny actually.  I'm laughing --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's really not funny because he's taking advantage of this  platform that he has with this book tour and just ignoring facts.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Let him keep speaking.  Please, keep speaking.  Let us see more  documents, let the investigations continue because all it does is exonerate  the collusion and all of the narratives they have and expose the snake pit  for what it is.</p><p> He says, \"I'm a private citizen\" yet the day before you weren't and the  document you created isn't private and you have no right to leak it and the  fact that he did what he did, he's a leaking launderer, right?  He wanted  to launder his leaks through somebody else that he could write his  (INAUDIBLE) it's all absurd.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, the Wall Street Journal has been  writing about what a weasel this guy is --</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- literally since before 2003.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They warned President Obama not to appoint him as the FBI  Director, the y-- the editorial page at the Journal warned President Trump,   nothing (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> HEGSETH:  James, how did you know?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because if you go through the man's history, he abuses power,  there's prosecutorial overreach, he is not a boy scout, he is less than a  snake.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Thank you.  Now, that's the pattern overtime and you saw it with  the e-mail investigation, you saw it with him basically running a rough  shot over longstanding Justice Department policies, acting as if he's a  prosecutor, he's not -- his job, head of the FBI to investigate and a lot  of prosecutors to make the appropriate decisions.</p><p> So it's just over and over again not following the rules but it's funny,  when you play that clip, I haven't seen it before and he started describing  what he was doing --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- thought, \"Gee, that sounds a lot like leaking.\"  What am I  missing here?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But kudos to Anderson Cooper and he did the stick to  the fire on that question and say, \"But isn't that leaking over and over  again?\"  To me, that was such arrogance and then to go on all of these  shows and say the president is unfit to be president.</p><p> You're unfit to be FBI director.  I mean, that's what's really clear.  But  the arrogance is up there with -- remember Shkreli when he was playing  videogames in the courtroom, that's where this arrogance is, I equate the  same.</p><p> FREEMAN:  And confidence, I don't want to change the subject too much.  But  you look at the resources, is FBI devoted to enforcing the rules of college  basketball?  Meanwhile ignoring for example this horrendous scandal in  gymnastics that was going on at the same time.  I mean, there's a long list  of not just the ethical issues but the confidence issues when he was  running the FBI.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure is.  All right, thank you for that.  We're going to take a  break.  When we come back, a manhunt is underway this morning for a suspect  accused of killing a main police officer then stealing his police cruiser.   The latest on the search, plus a startling new statistic about how many of  our heroes have been killed already this year.</p><p> Plus, Tesla's rough ride ahead of the self-driving business quits amidst  continuing safety issues.  Meanwhile, Elon Musk announces a shocking new  robot venture, we've got all the details right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A cop killer is on the loose in Maine this  morning.  An urgent manhunt underway, Cheryl Casone with the details and  headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right Maria.  Police are on the lookout  for this man, this is John Williams.  They say the 29-year-old gun down  Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine, that is just  north of Augusta.  </p><p> Williams then drove the cruiser to a nearby convenient store and robbed it.   Police releasing this photo captured of him from inside of that stolen car.   He then abandoned the car nearby, he has not been seen since.  Deputy Cole  had been on the force for 13 years, he lives behind a son.  </p><p> The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot in a Dallas Home  Depot, one of those officers was killed.  Official Rogelio Santander died  from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him in the back of  the head while trying to make an arrest.  Twenty-two officers have been  shot and killed so far this year, that is more than double from the same  time last year.  On average, at least one officer reportedly has been shot  to death every week so far in 2018.</p><p> Well, Tesla suffering a major lost in its self-driving car program.  The  leader of that division has left the company.  Jim Keller has taken a job  at Intel making him the latest to the string of very high level departures  from Tesla.  The self-driving program under new scrutiny after a Model X  driver died using autopilot in a crash south of San Francisco last month.</p><p> Meanwhile, Elon Musk is already on to his next project, he casually tweeted  last night that he's building a cyborg dragon.  Yes, you heard me  correctly.  He didn't give us any more details, it's unclear what he plans  to do with the sci-fi robot but, yes, the cyborg dragon.  Shares of Tesla  Maria are lower in the premarket but he's going to build a cyborg dragon.   Well, I'll let you sponge on that one.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is that?  What's a cyborg dragon?  </p><p> CASONE:  We don't know, that's all he tweets.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's just a robot.</p><p> CASONE:  Oki-dokie, we'll look for that.  Fix your cars.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  Robots, take it over man.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just have to share this tweet from one of the viewers, Michael  Hutchins related to the Comey discussion.  Remember what George Costanza  told Jerry Seinfeld, \"It's not a lie if you believe it.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, again, it's turned into a Seinfeld episode.  I wanted to  pass that along.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well we'll see what the I.G. report says about Jim Comey and  the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation because that's going to be the  focus in the next I.G. report that's coming out in the month of May.  We  know what the earlier I.G. report, it recommended criminal charges against  Andrew McCabe.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes, absolutely.  And we were talking in between, the vast  difference between how James Comey has treated others and the treatment he  expects themselves, it is offensive on how he looks down to people in a  condescending way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It really is.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, good  news for the president, a new poll shows that Americans believe President  Trump's policies are helping the economy.  We're taking a closer look at  those policies and how they're giving small businesses a big boost.</p><p> Then George H.W. Boost is out of intensive care and his biggest concern,  the health of his beloved Houston Rockets, more on that coming up this  morning, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings alert, Universal Health Services  reporting after the bell last night.  Profit and revenue up from a year  ago.  The company is shy of analyst expectations.  However, the numbers  Universal reporting adjusted earnings of $2.45 a share on revenue of $2.69  billion.</p><p> Joining me right now is the Founder and CEO of Universal Health Services,  Alan Miller.  Alan, great to see you.</p><p> ALAN MILLER, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES:  Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  Characterize the quarter for  us, what went off?</p><p> MILLER:  Well, we have two big segments.  One segment outpace the industry,  the other segment is catching up.  We've had some issues of shortage of  doctors and nurses and a few other incidents, and we're in the U.K. which  is going really well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The hospital segment in general has been struggling because we  see that the needs will get bigger and consolidate within hospitals.  Do  you still see that?</p><p> MILLER:  Yes.  There's consolidation because the insurance companies don't  want to pay and they're finding all kinds of ways to deny payment even  after we provide the service.</p><p> So -- I mean, that's not a good basis for business.  So we're letting them  know about it, we're suing them if we have to.  But the demand is so great  that the business is just a very sound business.  And we are -- and have  been from the outset a pioneer in mental health and mental health now as  you well know, two things are happening, people are recognizing that we  have mental health problems, 20 percent of the people in the country will  have a problem over their lifetime.  So, multiple it out, it's about 60  million people and we understand that half of those people don't get  treatment.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> MILLER:  So, we see results of a lot of it, in the news unfortunately, they  have to treated.  And the other thing that's happening which is good is  that people have gotten over the stigma of having a mental health person in  the family--</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Celebrities are coming forward about their illnesses, that sort  of --</p><p> MILLER:  Yes, the rock just came out --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  --taken some of the stigma away.</p><p> MILLER:  Exactly.  And we work with Herschel Walker, bless him who --  Herschel was a great, great football player and a rock of a man, like the  other Rock who just came out and Herschel like problems.  These are in  people's heads, not in their physical body and you -- and the thing that we  picked up on early was you can't be well, you -- if you're only well  medically unless you're well upstairs --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p> MILLER:  And people have not realized that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What can we do about it now?  I mean, even five-time  Grammy Winner Mariah Carey recently disclosing in People Magazine she  suffers from bipolar disorder.  Other singers and athletes also coming up  like Demi Lovato, Johnny Mandel --</p><p> MILLER:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- you mentioned Kevin Love.  What's the progress?  What can we  do about it?  Are they promising drugs out there?</p><p> MILLER:  It's not really the drugs, they have to -- if they're treated, if  they're seen earlier, then things can happen, psychologists, it's not only  drugs.  By the time you get to the drugs, perhaps they're in a -- they're  in a second stage.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well that's right.  And the drugs can be really harmful by the  way.  Look at opioids, right, a recent study by the Institute for Human for  Human Data Science finds that opioid prescriptions actually fell last year  by 10 percent --</p><p> MILLER:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- but the National Institute on Drug abuse found that 150  people a day are dying from opioid overdoes.</p><p> MILLER:  Yes.  But now there's pressure on doctors, that's the easy way.   People have pain, they give them opioid which does a short-term drug on the  pain but then they'll become addicted, so we can't do that.</p><p> So they're cutting back on that and they're using ibuprofen and Aleve and  this and that and they're finding out that it's helpful, more so than they  thought.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So where does the grow come from at Universal, let's call it  the next years?</p><p> MILLER:  Right.  Well number one, people are aging and we are building,  build a--we build hospital a year in acute care.  And they've been  spectacular.  We build in Southern California, we build in Henderson, in  Las Vegas.  There's tremendous demand.  </p><p> We also build in our psych division behavioral health and there's great  need for that and we're overseas in the U.K.  So we have three legs which I  always wanted --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MILLER:  -- and all of them are growing.  And we have been at is as talked,  this will be our 40th year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congratulations Al.</p><p> MILLER:  Thank you.  So people rely on us, they know that we do the right  thing and I know that we're concerned about the patients.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, because- -</p><p> MILLER:  Patients first is our concern.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're living longer and with that, we're leading more in our  older years for sure.  </p><p> MILLER:  But I'm very happy about the fact that these -- you mentioned  Mandel, Dwayne, \"The Rock,\" we've had Herschel for years, are making it  understood in society now that this is just like a sickness.</p><p> If someone has a gallbladder problem, nobody thinks twice about getting it  treated.  \"Oh, my son had a gallbladder or broke his arm or whatever,\"  mental health should be in that category.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well it's taking a while because I don't know that we've  actually had the treatments out there for mental health as prevalent as  treatment trough other things.  So for example, autism, Alzheimer's, I mean  we're studying the brain right now more and more, to learn more about these  things.</p><p> But we know a lot more about diabetes, we know a lot more about cancer.  I  mean, that's the point.  </p><p> MILLER:  Yes.  But the ones you mentioned are the generative, et cetera.   I'm talking about younger people who are fighting bipolar,  It's a  complicated society, there's a lot of pressures and a lot of people have  all of these pressures and they turn into depression and anxiety.</p><p> And the thing that really troubles me because we're very involved with the  military and think a great deal of them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MILLER:  They used to be two great institutions, one of them is the  military and the other was the FBI.  And so --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Isn't that a shame?  Isn't that a shame?</p><p> MILLER:  It is a shame.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MILLER:  It's a -- it is a shame.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Alan, thank you for coming in this morning.  </p><p> MILLER:  You're very welcome.  Great to see you again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Alan Miller joining us there, Universal  Health Services.  </p><p> Coming up, Ford cars are dead, long live the SUV.  The auto maker is making  big changes that looked to drive the company into the future.</p><p> Plus, drive-through Chipotle after posting better than expected earnings.   The CEO is outlying changes as the band looks for a new direction there,  we've got it all after this break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Thursday, it is  Thursday, April 26th, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East  Coast.  The busiest day for earnings yet, among the top names reporting  their first quarter this morning, Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, those are  coming out after the bell, tonight.  And Southwest Airlines just reported  mixed results this morning.</p><p> Ford, meanwhile, making major line-up changes, get this, the automaker will  only sell two cars at dealerships as drivers favor trucks and SUVs, find  out which cars are staying on the lot.  Chipotle, in earnings winner, the  struggling restaurant chain is showing signs of a turn around, the  company's profit and same store sales, beating expectations.  </p><p> Broader markets, this morning, looking good, we are expecting a higher  opening for the broader averages, Dow industrials set to open up about 30  points, S&amp;P is up three points and the NASDAQ right now, up a half a  percent, that's 32 points higher.</p><p> The Dow, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday, lifted by a  big beat from Boeing, Boeing stocks was strong as a Dow component, it  lifted the Dow up about 60 points, a quarter percent higher.  The NASDAQ  was lower yesterday by a fraction.  In Europe this morning, we are looking  at money moving into stocks, FT 100, CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are  higher, even if just by a fraction.  </p><p> We are waiting on the European Central Bank decision this morning, that is  due out in the next hour, we will have the news for you as soon as it hits  the tape.  No change on rates expected, but we will be watching the ECB  President, Mario Draghi, comment and his news conference about what he says  about stimulus going forward.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  The Shanghai Composite, worst  performer, down one and a third percent.  Targeting Trump supporters, a New  York City bar allowed to throw out patrons wearing Make America Great Again  hats, the outrage, coming up this morning.  And then from ugly to cool,  Adidas unveiling a dead shoe, how much it costs, coming up.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning, but first, this, another sign of  economic optimism, according to a new poll from Fox News, 43 percent of  Americans are happy with the economy, with nine percent calling it  excellent.  A Fox Business exclusive now, a new study from Bank of America  shows growing optimism among small business owners in America, 54 percent  of small business owners expect to see economic strengthening in the coming  year.  Joining us right now to talk more about that is Bank of America Head  of Small Business, Sharon Miller, Sharon, good to see you.</p><p> SHARON MILLER, HEAD, SMALL BUSINESS, BANK OF AMERICA:  Great to see you,  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What were the reasons that they were so optimistic?  Tell us  about this new outlook.</p><p> MILLER:  Well, tax reform was certainly a game-changer, we heard loud and  clear from our small business owners that they were very optimistic  following the tax reform and that's more money to invest back into their  business, whether it's hiring more people, buying more equipment, whatever  it may be, but it is definitely a game-changer.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you wonder how long the runway this has, given the fact  that we've already seen a real impact from the tax cut plan, but it's  expected to keep having an impact over the year.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, I think the stock prices obviously  get revised immediately, but as far as small business, what is the outlook  in terms of how it changes this coming year?</p><p> MILLER:  Well, small business, it's a local business and so what we are  seeing across the United States is optimism.  The headline is that we've  seen more optimistic, people are very positive about the outlook in their  local economies as well as the national economy, and that's a good sign for  business ahead.</p><p> HEGSETH:  How often do you hear about regulation or the reduction thereof  and how significant that's been?</p><p> MILLER:  It is, I mean, it is significant.  The less bureaucracy you have,  the less red tapes, so to speak.  It's better for business and they are  able to be more efficient, they're able to get through and understand what  the impacts are on their business.  So this is a positive for small  business owners, it can be very complex and then trying to understand how  to run your business, on top of that, how to understand the regulations,  it's a lot for one person to take.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How does this optimism, though, translate into ramping up  economic growth in this country whether it's through hiring, raises or  investment in their businesses?</p><p> MILLER:  Well, we are seeing all of that.  The one thing that I would point  to, is there is a war for talent out there.  Small business owners, I talk  to them all the time, across the country, they want to hire, they want to  attract good employees, and the right employees that are quality and that  understand their business and can add value to them.  </p><p> And what's happening is it's just -- because of such a great economy and  the very low unemployment, we are not able to find qualified workers in the  small business camps.  And so you've got to look at benefits, you've got to  look at all sights -- sorts of other things to attract the right workers  into the small businesses.</p><p> FREEMAN:  So, Sharon, we are seeing this surge in confidence and optimism  among the business owners, but generally, we haven't seen, over the last  year, a lot of loan growth or maybe not as much as we'd like to see, do you  see that changing now or are there reasons why we shouldn't be concerned  even if the loan growth isn't off the charts?</p><p> MILLER:  Well, I think there's -- you know, there's different segments with  loan growth.  And so in the small business face Bank of America, we are  seeing demand for lending.  Our lending is strong and I would say that, you  know, when small businesses get started, generally, they will start with  either personal savings, perhaps a credit card, and then they are able to  get more traditional financing.  </p><p> We also partner with community development financial institutions for these  small businesses that may not be eligible for traditional financing.  But  we are seeing demand both in our traditional lines and loans as well as our  health care, so lending to dentists, doctors, veterinarians.</p><p> HEGSETH:  Sharon, but not all small businesses are created equal, some  sectors are struggling, may not feel optimism, where do you see the most  optimism and what places are not?</p><p> MILLER:  Well, I think, in the technology section, and certainly, there was  a question in our survey that was all around, what do you think about  digital payments?  And half of our small business owners felt like over the  next five years, that's all they would be taking.  </p><p> So instead of checks and instead of the way we may pay traditionally today,  especially to small business in the local (INAUDIBLE) landscaper, you know  your dry cleaner.  They are talking about all digital payments which is,  you know, quite -- there's a trickle down there because there's people that  have to build those types of capabilities.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you've got nearly one-third of all small businesses using  smart phones --</p><p> MILLER:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  to process digital payments, that's interesting.  Are the small  businesses having their access to credit?  I mean, how is that going in  terms of business getting the credit that they need?  That was one issue  that Linda McMahon brought up when she joined us, the Small Business  Administrator, earlier in the week.  </p><p> MILLER:  Yes.  And there is access to capital, I mean, that's something  that we want to make sure they were out there, we're teaching people how to  get access to capital and what you need to do when you're starting a small  business, how you have to have revenues that are going to be able to repay  that loan, so access to capital can come in more ways than just a  traditional loan and there's education, there's training.  </p><p> We are very focused on women, we just announced, last week, the Institute  for Women's Entrepreneurship and Bank of America partnership with Cornell  University, this is all about our attempt to make sure that we're giving  the education, the training and the information necessary for people to get  access to capital.  Many people don't know how to do it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, compare women start-ups to male start-ups, what's higher?</p><p> MILLER:  Women are starting businesses at twice the rate of men with half  the capital.  And so, it say, it's definitely a great opportunity for us to  partner.  We will be, in fact, at Times Square, this week.  We are posting  poster love for Small Business.  We want to make sure that, you know, if  you like a small business, go online, give a good review for them because  that's going to help them in the local economy. So there's a lot of  opportunity for us to support small businesses and it's good for the local  communities.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  By the way, what's a small business?  How do you identify that?</p><p> MILLER:  Less than five million in revenues and 100 employees or less, so  these are small businesses.  This is the heart of America.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They have to be sitting there, though (INAUDIBLE) requirement to  provide health insurance to go away which the government has yet to repeal  the employer mandate, we got rid of individual mandate.  Is that -- is that  on their wish list and high on it?</p><p> MILLER:  Listen, health care is the number one concern.  It continues to be  in every report.  We survey and every survey we take of small business  owners across the United States, it was number one concern, this time, too.   So the cost of health care, the complexity and a lot of other things, so  health care is definitely the top of the list.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  By the way, they are using digital.  They are not feeling the  crypto craze, though, right?  That's also something we should point out.   There are two percent of small business owners believe crypto will be  relevant to them but aren't sure how.  Bitcoin has been all the buzz in  Wall Street, obviously, in some quarters.  It's not gaining traction for  small business.</p><p> MILLER:  No, it's not.  It's not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there, Sharon, great to see you.</p><p> MILLER:  Thank you, great to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  We'll keep watching, Sharon  Miller, joining us there.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  supporters of President Trump can get the boot from a bar, that's the  ruling of a New York City judge, the outrage, coming up this morning.  And  then, forget dad jeans, Adidas is launching dad sneakers, but dad might  walk away when he sees the price of these no frills kicks, back in a  minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big news from Ford Motor, the company putting a  big part of its car business in the rear-view mirror.  Cheryl Casone with  the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  OK.  So, if you like Ford Sedans, you better get one before  they're all gone, Martha.  Ford says that they're going to stop making the  Fiesta sub-compact, the Fusion mid-sized Sedan, and the Tourist large  Sedan.  After that, Ford's only going to have two cars left in the line-up  -- the mustang, of course, and a new hatchback of the focus active.  The  plan is to introduce more trucks and SUVs, which have been more popular  with buyers, frankly.  Shares of Ford are down about 12 percent so far this  year.  </p><p> Well, Chipotle is looking at options in an effort to try and turn around  their business.  Brian Nickel, who's the company's news CEO says that  Chipotle is considering a few different things.  Maybe they're going to  franchise, maybe some new menu items, they're thinking about drive-throughs  now.  Shares up more than 10 percent in extended trading after their first- quarter results came in better than expected.  The stock is up 15 percent  so far this year.  They're in recovery mode.  </p><p> Well, get this.  So, this is one of those only-in-New-York-stories.   Supporters of President Trump can legally be thrown out of a bar because of  their political beliefs, that's according to a Manhattan judge who ruled in  favor of a that refuse to serve a man wearing a make America great hat.   The judge says, current laws don't protect against political  discrimination.  This happened just after President Trump's inauguration.   After the guy complained about room service, the Trump supporter says staff  told him that he wasn't welcome there anymore, yes. </p><p> And then there's this, Adidas is getting into the dad shoe craze because,  apparently, there's dad shoe craze out there.  They have a new sneaker  called the young one, which is reminiscent of the 1990s shoe.  It's got a  kind of a chunky design, the sole is thick, it's got suede, it's got nylon.   This is basically all the rage right now, Maria.  So, the retro shoe, if  you want to pay the price, $130.  So, to be a cool dad is not so cool and  cheap, but there you have it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, let's do a survey.  We got some cool dads on the set  right now. </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's not get crazy.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> HEGSETH:  I mean, if you're wearing the dad shoe, I think you've given up  on life.  And it's not a good-looking shoe.  I'm sorry, Adidas.  I like  Adidas.  But all white is just too much for me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, that's not a cool dad shoe.  What do you think, James?</p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't know.  Wearing something that's specifically marketed as  the dad shoe, I'm not sure just how cool that really would be, but -- I  don't need it.  I tend to avoid exercise.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you have an injury -- a running injury, there's a brand of  shoe called HOKA.  Do you know what I'm talking about?  H-O-K-A.  They're  big gigantic, chunky, and hideous.  They're terrific athletic shoes and  they're running shoes but they look kind of like that.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes.  Well, you don't have to choose to wear them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're great shoes, by the way.  I was talking about the trend,  ugly, expensive tennis shoe, I just found a pair of Balenciaga women's  sneakers, they're only $900.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's Balenciaga.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  In case anybody has a bathtub full of cash and is really stupid.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will take a break on that note.  Coming up, the wait is  finally over.  It is NFL draft day on FOX.  We're taking you inside the  private NFL owners' meeting about national anthem protest.  Sports, is  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Lebron James does it again, another highlight to  add to James' real.  Jared Max with highlights.  Wild night in NBA Playoffs  last night, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Maria, the Cavaliers and the Pacers  were tied 2-2, in their first-round playoff series.  Tied 95-95 under 10  seconds to play.  Game five, Lebron, the stage is yours.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (CROWD CHEERING)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  James, two seconds, one second for the win.  </p><p> (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lebron James delivers.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MAX:  Of course, Lebron scores 44, 15 to 15 from the foul line.  The  Pacers' Victor Oladipo said he should've -- gotten a goal-tending call at  the other end.  But you know, Lebron hit the three-point shot at the other  end.  Cavs up, 3-2.  </p><p> Lebron, not the highest scorer in the NBA Playoffs last night.  Russell  Westbrook was -- he had 45.  The Thunder trailed the Jazz by 25 points in  the third quarter, and then outscored Utah, 61-28, over the final 20.5  minutes.  They win by eight.  Thunder still alive, down 3-2.  </p><p> Former President George Herbert-Walker Bush has been moved out of an ICU  unit into a regular hospital room, and he is focused on basketball.  A  statement released says, \"President Bush naturally thanks everyone for  their prayers and good wishes.  He also wants to assure everyone that as  good as he feels now, he's more focused on the Houston Rockets closing out  their playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves than anything that  landed him into the hospital.\"  Well, President Bush should be smiling  today.  Houston Rockets won last night.  They eliminated the Timberwolves  in game five with ease, 122-104; 30 points for James Harden.  </p><p> For the first time, we can say the NFL draft kicks off tonight on Fox 8:00  Eastern Time, AT&amp;T stadium outside of Dallas, the draft will begin, the  Cleveland Browns select Pete Hegseth -- no, you to tune in to see what it's  going to be.  The Browns have the first and the fourth picks.  </p><p> The New York Times obtained an audio recording of a meeting that NFL owners  and select players last fall, after President Trump suggested that any  player who kneeled for national anthem should be fired, well, Bob Kraft,  owner of New England Patriots, who's reported to have given President Trump  a Super Bowl ring apparently isn't entirely on the president's side.  </p><p> According to the New York Times, Kraft was reportedly recorded saying at  the meeting: \"The problem we have is, we have a president who will use that  as fodder to do his mission that I don't feel is in the best interest of  America.\"  Robert Kraft says, \"it's divisive and it's horrible.\"  Over  three hours of audio recordings coming out at that the New York Times have  said to have listened to.  You can imagine some of the comments that, you  know, might've gone on in this meeting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this from a supporter.  I mean, Bob Kraft has been  supporter of the president.  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Yes, yes!  I mean, the whole meeting was supposed to be  confidential which, of course, never happens.  I'm surprised here that Bob  Kraft say that.  He was one of those that you felt like was probably  frustrated with the anthem protest and felt like the solution was to just  stand for the anthem.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, he doesn't want lower ratings.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can tell you one of the problems was though, is fewer and  fewer players week after week were taking a knee during the national  anthem.  President Trump was still tweeting about it and drawing attention  to it and trying to wit people into a frenzy over it, when it was less of a  story if you were actually watching the game.  And I think that the owners  rightfully had problem with that.  </p><p> MAX:  Dagen, I think a lot of owners also found themselves in weird  position because a game of politics, no pun intended, but here's something  important from the president, but now they also have Rosters of 53.  Jerry  Jones found himself kneeling and then standing up -- almost like he didn't  know what to do.  All of a sudden, he was involved.  So, not everybody --  it was a first time for everybody.  Not that I'm giving him a pass, but I  wonder why the Democrat --  </p><p> HEGSETH:  Yet it was (INAUDIBLE) in the off season.  I mean, it still  remains an issue, the NFL won't tackle and hasn't tackled yet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, has Colin Kaepernick gotten a job yet?  </p><p> MAX:  No.  The Seahawks, maybe.  Whoever is the 14th pick of the third  round.  Pie 3-14, gets free pizza for a year from Pizza Hut.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The problem with any owner taking Colin Kaepernick on at this  point is he's got a divisive figure, and it's not just for the fans, it's  even in the locker room -- it's a distraction.  </p><p> MAX:  You're paying more than $25.00 for baggage fees.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's it, it's distraction.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You need to focus on the game.  Again, the owners, what are you  going to do?  Tell all these men that they can't take a knee?  And that  essentially violates their first amendment rights, you can't do that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jared, thank you.  Jared Max.

MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST: Here there ladies, good morning to you. Thanks so much Gerri. Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, April 26thm happy Thursday. Your top stories right now 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is the busiest single day of earnings season so far, industry giants like General Motors, Starbucks, Amazon, Microsoft all reporting their quarterly results today. Ahead of the earning splits, Futures indicating higher opening for the broader averages. Check it out, Dow Industrials up about 30 points right now, it's a fractional move on a percentage basis. So as is the S&amp;P500, the NASDAQ right now, up half a percent, 33 points higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday lifted by Boeing's big earnings beat. Stock was strong. In yesterday's closing session, the Dow ended up 60 points, the S&amp;P was up five, and the NASDAQ was down a fraction, three and a half points lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we've got gains across the board. Fractional move but the FT-100 is up 12, CAC Quarante in Paris is up 24 and the DAX Index up 21 points.</p><p>Investors are waiting on the European Central Bank decision this morning, that's due out in the next hour. No change in rates expected but the focus will be on the ECB President, Mario Draghi and his comments about the Future stimulus during his news conference. We'll bring you all the news from Europe coming up.</p><p>In Asia Overnight markets were mixed, the Shanghai Composite down one and a third percent, worst performer in China as you see.</p><p>And Facebook back on Wall Street's friends list, the stock soaring in the premarket this morning due to strong first quarter results showing an increase in daily users and monthly users despite the ongoing data scandal. The stock at 107 and change right now, we're breaking down those numbers, talk with Dan Niles, his number one position there coming up.</p><p>Another speed bump for Tesla to report, the new trouble for Elon Musk's electric automaker as the key member of the autopilot team departs amid new safety questions.</p><p>Then from flamethrowers to fire breathers, Elon Musk reveals his latest project, a cyborg dragon. The first details on the wild new robot coming up this morning.</p><p>And then walk a mile in dad shoes, Adidas unveils the perfect sneaker for keeping that dad bod in top shape.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to talk all about it, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell. The Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman along with Iraq and Afghanistan War Veteran, FOX News Contributor, Pete Hegseth is here. Great to see you Pete.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see -- if those are the world's best sneakers, the world has gone mad.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really?</p><p>HEGSETH: They're OK but the best? I don't know.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: The trend in cool sneakers is the uglier and the more expensive.</p><p>HEGSETH: Oh, really.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can find you a pair of $1,200 sneakers that certainly none of your children would be caught wearing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But can you press a button and order pizza from it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. Actually, you know what --</p><p>HEGSETH: That's true. That's true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have no sneakers (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Those shoes -- those -- I'm talking about sneakers so expensive, they should come with their own brick pizza oven quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot going on this morning, biggest day in earnings so far.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think it's exciting to have the dad bod trend continue but, yes, you -- expectation is so high for American business and American business keeps beating them. So we'll see again today if the Facebook pattern continues to the rest of the techs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We're talking about 18, 19 percent earnings growth for the S&amp;P500 for the first quarter, same thing for 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But with valuations going into this quarter, it has to be better than perfect. There is no such thing as 110 percent in terms of you can deliver a 100 percent but they need to deliver more than that.</p><p>One of the things that Facebook did yesterday and we'll get into it is they up the buybacks. So they're going to buyback an additional $9 billion in shares adding to the $6 billion previously authorized. So I think Facebook management stepped back and said, \"We need to do something to reduce this stock.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we'll see about that. It is getting juiced this morning, that's for sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's up pretty big. Coming up this morning, joining the conversation, the Chairman of the House Republican Conference and Washington Congresswoman, Cathy McMorris Rodgers is with us. California Congressman, John Garamendi is here along with Alpha One Capital Partners Founding Partner, Dan Niles who predicted a very good quarter for Facebook by the way, he's going to weigh in on the numbers. Plus, Universal Health Services Founder and CEO, Alan Miller is with us as well. Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>We kick it off right here this hour with this, the technology earnings blitz on Wall Street, investors are watching Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel all ahead of their results after the bell tonight and it's going to be important given what's been going on with tech.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook topped Wall Street expectations yesterday reporting adjusted earnings of $1.69 a share, revenue coming in $11.97 billion. It is the technology titan's first earnings report since the user data crisis, the stock is trading up this morning. As you can see, up six and two- thirds percent or $10-1/2 a share, James Freeman, your reaction to the Facebook news.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I think it's probably sometimes difficult for people to understand why a company can have all of these bad headlines and have its business performing so well. And I think it's a couple of things.</p><p>One is that while people are concerned about their data, they obviously value what they get from Facebook in terms of the ability to communicate with friends more than they're concerned about having to share information about themselves. The other issue is that even if regulation comes, big incumbent in an industry tend to do fine. We have a heavy regulated situation, the barriers to entry, the smaller competitors go up, and the new side of our paper had a story this week about an E.U. regulator going out to California talking to the big tech companies about privacy regulations.</p><p>She thought they were going to freak out and they said, \"No, we're good.\" This regulation is always a bigger burden for the smaller competitors. So if it comes in the U.S., you worry about the next challenger to Facebook more than Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's interesting because even the company's total cost in expenses were up 39 percent year-over-year in the first quarter but the acceleration of expense growth is driven by other things, the anticipation of regulation driven by security, content investment, and long-term bets like IA.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Now they did say to expect higher expenses going forward and some of that will be I'm sure having to deal with compliance and political nuttiness side of Washington but the business is very healthy because people despite their unease welcome the trade. I give you my data, you know all about me and then return, I get lots of services for free.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Especially young people. Especially young people.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So far, people think that way.</p><p>FREEMAN: So far. That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And he added 70 million monthly, uses a lot of what was discovered about -- and by the way, people keep referring to this as the Cambridge Analytica scandal at Facebook --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know, it's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is a scan -- this is a gross misuse and reckless disregard for people's privacy in data literally for more than the last decade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No. Let's go back to the Barrack Obama years and what -- he was a master at mining all of the data. And Facebook was like, \"Come on in, here's all of our user information.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's go back --</p><p>HEGSETH: And (INAUDIBLE) Facebook into the head of the curve.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well the -- it started even before that. It started even before President Obama won the White House the first go around. It started back in 2007. The bigger -- so the question is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it was really effective for the Obama presidency.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In 2012 for sure. So will Facebook user stick around? Will the user growth continue to go great guns the way it has? And tell you, what are the advertisers going to do?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And so far based on just anecdotal information and evidence that the Wall Street Journal collected, Sheryl Sandberg said yesterday the company hasn't seen a meaningful trend of advertisers leaving the platform but it's still a wait and see. Plus, the stock through yesterday's close was down 18 percent from the record high in early February.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So you get a boost this morning, it's still off nearly 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well the advertisers aren't stupid, they want the 2.2 billion users on them.</p><p>HEGSETH: Of course. And the 2.2 billion users are -- they may have been a Few bad headlines but if you were logging on to Facebook yesterday, you're logging on to Facebook today, they have been incredibly effective at monetizing their business model.</p><p>And as James says, he's exactly right, they get to sit at the table with the regulators which means they'll benefit and find a way to maneuver any regulations coming down the pipe.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Diamond &amp; Silk are testifying this morning before the House Judiciary Committee after saying that their conservative content on Facebook was censored. The Congressional panel also inviting representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter to the hearing on social media filtering practices and its effect on free speech.</p><p>Bottom line here, this is one of the issues that Congress is most upset about and that they're going to be pressing --</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- the fact that they are deciding what we see and what we hear.</p><p>HEGSETH: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's what Diamond &amp; Silk are going to be testifying about today.</p><p>HEGSETH: It will be great TV I'll tell you that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HEGSETH: I mean, they don't hold back, set your DVRs, I'm sure it will be fascinating. But they -- their finger is on the pulse of what I think is the biggest concern for many Americans around Facebook, is my content being blocked based on algorithm I'm not aware of?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>HEGSETH: And is there an ideological slant to that algorithm and people -- they have a platform to speak out. Most people who are speaking out don't and have this sense that their content isn't reaching people, a big concern for --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's why they don't get sued because they're supposed to be the area that people from all different areas can talk and exchange ideas.</p><p>HEGSETH: But they're not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But they're -- they may not be, that's the issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But if you're pro-life and pro second amendment, your content will be taken down quite frankly in some instances. I've had friends --</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's wrong.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've had friends that experience that. There was an incident that I believe Mark Zuckerberg was asked about when he testified in front of Congress, it was a Catholic University's content of Jesus on the cross was censored.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And he did -- and he acted like -- he played dumb. Maybe he didn't know about that one instant. But, again, they're trying to be more transparent Facebook is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are they trying? That's what I wanted to see, actually the effort because I don't know about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're trying to be -- they're trying to be more (INAUDIBLE) until the users, what would trigger con -- basically content censorship.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I think this is going to be an increasing issue. I mean, you celebrate these social media companies because they did disrupt media in the sense that the New York Times doesn't have the political, cultural power it used to given that everyone can communicate now. But this is the question, are they the new gatekeepers that are going to do what the yield gatekeepers did in screening out opinions that don't agree with.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you a platform or are you a gatekeeper? We got to talk about former FBI Director Jim Comey, did anybody see that interview last night? I tweeted this, \"Wow, just wow.\"</p><p>His leaked memos, a catalyst for the special counsel investigation was more widely shared than previously thought. Source is telling FOX News that Comey likely gave his documents to former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and possibly another person, along with the Columbia law school professor. Watch this as Comey tries to defend his actions of leaking the memos to the professor last night in the CNN Town Hall, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think that there's any credence from the president's claims that you broke the law when you released your memos?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: I don't. That won't surprise you, I don't. In fact, I think he's just making stuff up. I didn't leak memos, I asked a friend to communicate the substance of one unclassified --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>COMEY: I intentionally gave this information to a friend intending that it would be out in the media, I wanted it to get in the media.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>COMEY: As a private citizen, I could do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just because you say you're not leaking, Dagen, doesn't mean you're not leaking. We're not idiots, OK? We're not morons. You actually leaked a memo to your friend who's a professor, now you're saying, \"I didn't leak it because I told him, \"Oh, get it to the New York Times, just the content, don't give the actual paper.\" I mean, this is -- I'm outraged.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You just defined what the word leak means.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does he think anyone is buying this?</p><p>MCDOWELL: He doesn't care if they're buy -- he only cares if they're buying that book that he's written. I tweeted last night, I said, \"To call Washington, D.C. a bunch -- a snake pit is an insult to snakes.\"</p><p>FREEMAN: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He -- the -- what did he say, \"That I'm not a weasel\" that was in the notes that were --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, he came off like such a weasel last night.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know if he told the president I'm not a weasel. Again, by his actions, defining what weasel means.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Isn't that extraordinary though that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's not funny actually. I'm laughing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's really not funny because he's taking advantage of this platform that he has with this book tour and just ignoring facts.</p><p>HEGSETH: Let him keep speaking. Please, keep speaking. Let us see more documents, let the investigations continue because all it does is exonerate the collusion and all of the narratives they have and expose the snake pit for what it is.</p><p>He says, \"I'm a private citizen\" yet the day before you weren't and the document you created isn't private and you have no right to leak it and the fact that he did what he did, he's a leaking launderer, right? He wanted to launder his leaks through somebody else that he could write his (INAUDIBLE) it's all absurd.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's incredible.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to point out, the Wall Street Journal has been writing about what a weasel this guy is --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- literally since before 2003.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They warned President Obama not to appoint him as the FBI Director, the y-- the editorial page at the Journal warned President Trump, nothing (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HEGSETH: James, how did you know?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because if you go through the man's history, he abuses power, there's prosecutorial overreach, he is not a boy scout, he is less than a snake.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: Thank you. Now, that's the pattern overtime and you saw it with the e-mail investigation, you saw it with him basically running a rough shot over longstanding Justice Department policies, acting as if he's a prosecutor, he's not -- his job, head of the FBI to investigate and a lot of prosecutors to make the appropriate decisions.</p><p>So it's just over and over again not following the rules but it's funny, when you play that clip, I haven't seen it before and he started describing what he was doing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- thought, \"Gee, that sounds a lot like leaking.\" What am I missing here?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. But kudos to Anderson Cooper and he did the stick to the fire on that question and say, \"But isn't that leaking over and over again?\" To me, that was such arrogance and then to go on all of these shows and say the president is unfit to be president.</p><p>You're unfit to be FBI director. I mean, that's what's really clear. But the arrogance is up there with -- remember Shkreli when he was playing videogames in the courtroom, that's where this arrogance is, I equate the same.</p><p>FREEMAN: And confidence, I don't want to change the subject too much. But you look at the resources, is FBI devoted to enforcing the rules of college basketball? Meanwhile ignoring for example this horrendous scandal in gymnastics that was going on at the same time. I mean, there's a long list of not just the ethical issues but the confidence issues when he was running the FBI.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure is. All right, thank you for that. We're going to take a break. When we come back, a manhunt is underway this morning for a suspect accused of killing a main police officer then stealing his police cruiser. The latest on the search, plus a startling new statistic about how many of our heroes have been killed already this year.</p><p>Plus, Tesla's rough ride ahead of the self-driving business quits amidst continuing safety issues. Meanwhile, Elon Musk announces a shocking new robot venture, we've got all the details right here. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A cop killer is on the loose in Maine this morning. An urgent manhunt underway, Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: That's right Maria. Police are on the lookout for this man, this is John Williams. They say the 29-year-old gun down Deputy Eugene Cole yesterday morning in Norridgewock, Maine, that is just north of Augusta.</p><p>Williams then drove the cruiser to a nearby convenient store and robbed it. Police releasing this photo captured of him from inside of that stolen car. He then abandoned the car nearby, he has not been seen since. Deputy Cole had been on the force for 13 years, he lives behind a son.</p><p>The attack coming just a day after two officers were shot in a Dallas Home Depot, one of those officers was killed. Official Rogelio Santander died from his injuries after police say Armando Juarez shot him in the back of the head while trying to make an arrest. Twenty-two officers have been shot and killed so far this year, that is more than double from the same time last year. On average, at least one officer reportedly has been shot to death every week so far in 2018.</p><p>Well, Tesla suffering a major lost in its self-driving car program. The leader of that division has left the company. Jim Keller has taken a job at Intel making him the latest to the string of very high level departures from Tesla. The self-driving program under new scrutiny after a Model X driver died using autopilot in a crash south of San Francisco last month.</p><p>Meanwhile, Elon Musk is already on to his next project, he casually tweeted last night that he's building a cyborg dragon. Yes, you heard me correctly. He didn't give us any more details, it's unclear what he plans to do with the sci-fi robot but, yes, the cyborg dragon. Shares of Tesla Maria are lower in the premarket but he's going to build a cyborg dragon. Well, I'll let you sponge on that one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is that? What's a cyborg dragon?</p><p>CASONE: We don't know, that's all he tweets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's just a robot.</p><p>CASONE: Oki-dokie, we'll look for that. Fix your cars.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Robots, take it over man.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just have to share this tweet from one of the viewers, Michael Hutchins related to the Comey discussion. Remember what George Costanza told Jerry Seinfeld, \"It's not a lie if you believe it.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, again, it's turned into a Seinfeld episode. I wanted to pass that along.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well we'll see what the I.G. report says about Jim Comey and the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation because that's going to be the focus in the next I.G. report that's coming out in the month of May. We know what the earlier I.G. report, it recommended criminal charges against Andrew McCabe.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes, absolutely. And we were talking in between, the vast difference between how James Comey has treated others and the treatment he expects themselves, it is offensive on how he looks down to people in a condescending way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really is. We'll take a break. When we come back, good news for the president, a new poll shows that Americans believe President Trump's policies are helping the economy. We're taking a closer look at those policies and how they're giving small businesses a big boost.</p><p>Then George H.W. Boost is out of intensive care and his biggest concern, the health of his beloved Houston Rockets, more on that coming up this morning, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Earnings alert, Universal Health Services reporting after the bell last night. Profit and revenue up from a year ago. The company is shy of analyst expectations. However, the numbers Universal reporting adjusted earnings of $2.45 a share on revenue of $2.69 billion.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Founder and CEO of Universal Health Services, Alan Miller. Alan, great to see you.</p><p>ALAN MILLER, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. Characterize the quarter for us, what went off?</p><p>MILLER: Well, we have two big segments. One segment outpace the industry, the other segment is catching up. We've had some issues of shortage of doctors and nurses and a few other incidents, and we're in the U.K. which is going really well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The hospital segment in general has been struggling because we see that the needs will get bigger and consolidate within hospitals. Do you still see that?</p><p>MILLER: Yes. There's consolidation because the insurance companies don't want to pay and they're finding all kinds of ways to deny payment even after we provide the service.</p><p>So -- I mean, that's not a good basis for business. So we're letting them know about it, we're suing them if we have to. But the demand is so great that the business is just a very sound business. And we are -- and have been from the outset a pioneer in mental health and mental health now as you well know, two things are happening, people are recognizing that we have mental health problems, 20 percent of the people in the country will have a problem over their lifetime. So, multiple it out, it's about 60 million people and we understand that half of those people don't get treatment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MILLER: So, we see results of a lot of it, in the news unfortunately, they have to treated. And the other thing that's happening which is good is that people have gotten over the stigma of having a mental health person in the family--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Celebrities are coming forward about their illnesses, that sort of --</p><p>MILLER: Yes, the rock just came out --</p><p>BARTIROMO: --taken some of the stigma away.</p><p>MILLER: Exactly. And we work with Herschel Walker, bless him who -- Herschel was a great, great football player and a rock of a man, like the other Rock who just came out and Herschel like problems. These are in people's heads, not in their physical body and you -- and the thing that we picked up on early was you can't be well, you -- if you're only well medically unless you're well upstairs --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course.</p><p>MILLER: And people have not realized that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. What can we do about it now? I mean, even five-time Grammy Winner Mariah Carey recently disclosing in People Magazine she suffers from bipolar disorder. Other singers and athletes also coming up like Demi Lovato, Johnny Mandel --</p><p>MILLER: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- you mentioned Kevin Love. What's the progress? What can we do about it? Are they promising drugs out there?</p><p>MILLER: It's not really the drugs, they have to -- if they're treated, if they're seen earlier, then things can happen, psychologists, it's not only drugs. By the time you get to the drugs, perhaps they're in a -- they're in a second stage.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well that's right. And the drugs can be really harmful by the way. Look at opioids, right, a recent study by the Institute for Human for Human Data Science finds that opioid prescriptions actually fell last year by 10 percent --</p><p>MILLER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- but the National Institute on Drug abuse found that 150 people a day are dying from opioid overdoes.</p><p>MILLER: Yes. But now there's pressure on doctors, that's the easy way. People have pain, they give them opioid which does a short-term drug on the pain but then they'll become addicted, so we can't do that.</p><p>So they're cutting back on that and they're using ibuprofen and Aleve and this and that and they're finding out that it's helpful, more so than they thought.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So where does the grow come from at Universal, let's call it the next years?</p><p>MILLER: Right. Well number one, people are aging and we are building, build a--we build hospital a year in acute care. And they've been spectacular. We build in Southern California, we build in Henderson, in Las Vegas. There's tremendous demand.</p><p>We also build in our psych division behavioral health and there's great need for that and we're overseas in the U.K. So we have three legs which I always wanted --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MILLER: -- and all of them are growing. And we have been at is as talked, this will be our 40th year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations Al.</p><p>MILLER: Thank you. So people rely on us, they know that we do the right thing and I know that we're concerned about the patients.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because- -</p><p>MILLER: Patients first is our concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're living longer and with that, we're leading more in our older years for sure.</p><p>MILLER: But I'm very happy about the fact that these -- you mentioned Mandel, Dwayne, \"The Rock,\" we've had Herschel for years, are making it understood in society now that this is just like a sickness.</p><p>If someone has a gallbladder problem, nobody thinks twice about getting it treated. \"Oh, my son had a gallbladder or broke his arm or whatever,\" mental health should be in that category.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well it's taking a while because I don't know that we've actually had the treatments out there for mental health as prevalent as treatment trough other things. So for example, autism, Alzheimer's, I mean we're studying the brain right now more and more, to learn more about these things.</p><p>But we know a lot more about diabetes, we know a lot more about cancer. I mean, that's the point.</p><p>MILLER: Yes. But the ones you mentioned are the generative, et cetera. I'm talking about younger people who are fighting bipolar, It's a complicated society, there's a lot of pressures and a lot of people have all of these pressures and they turn into depression and anxiety.</p><p>And the thing that really troubles me because we're very involved with the military and think a great deal of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MILLER: They used to be two great institutions, one of them is the military and the other was the FBI. And so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Isn't that a shame? Isn't that a shame?</p><p>MILLER: It is a shame.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MILLER: It's a -- it is a shame.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alan, thank you for coming in this morning.</p><p>MILLER: You're very welcome. Great to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you. Alan Miller joining us there, Universal Health Services.</p><p>Coming up, Ford cars are dead, long live the SUV. The auto maker is making big changes that looked to drive the company into the future.</p><p>Plus, drive-through Chipotle after posting better than expected earnings. The CEO is outlying changes as the band looks for a new direction there, we've got it all after this break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Thursday, it is Thursday, April 26th, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. The busiest day for earnings yet, among the top names reporting their first quarter this morning, Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, those are coming out after the bell, tonight. And Southwest Airlines just reported mixed results this morning.</p><p>Ford, meanwhile, making major line-up changes, get this, the automaker will only sell two cars at dealerships as drivers favor trucks and SUVs, find out which cars are staying on the lot. Chipotle, in earnings winner, the struggling restaurant chain is showing signs of a turn around, the company's profit and same store sales, beating expectations.</p><p>Broader markets, this morning, looking good, we are expecting a higher opening for the broader averages, Dow industrials set to open up about 30 points, S&amp;P is up three points and the NASDAQ right now, up a half a percent, that's 32 points higher.</p><p>The Dow, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak yesterday, lifted by a big beat from Boeing, Boeing stocks was strong as a Dow component, it lifted the Dow up about 60 points, a quarter percent higher. The NASDAQ was lower yesterday by a fraction. In Europe this morning, we are looking at money moving into stocks, FT 100, CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are higher, even if just by a fraction.</p><p>We are waiting on the European Central Bank decision this morning, that is due out in the next hour, we will have the news for you as soon as it hits the tape. No change on rates expected, but we will be watching the ECB President, Mario Draghi, comment and his news conference about what he says about stimulus going forward.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed. The Shanghai Composite, worst performer, down one and a third percent. Targeting Trump supporters, a New York City bar allowed to throw out patrons wearing Make America Great Again hats, the outrage, coming up this morning. And then from ugly to cool, Adidas unveiling a dead shoe, how much it costs, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning, but first, this, another sign of economic optimism, according to a new poll from Fox News, 43 percent of Americans are happy with the economy, with nine percent calling it excellent. A Fox Business exclusive now, a new study from Bank of America shows growing optimism among small business owners in America, 54 percent of small business owners expect to see economic strengthening in the coming year. Joining us right now to talk more about that is Bank of America Head of Small Business, Sharon Miller, Sharon, good to see you.</p><p>SHARON MILLER, HEAD, SMALL BUSINESS, BANK OF AMERICA: Great to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What were the reasons that they were so optimistic? Tell us about this new outlook.</p><p>MILLER: Well, tax reform was certainly a game-changer, we heard loud and clear from our small business owners that they were very optimistic following the tax reform and that's more money to invest back into their business, whether it's hiring more people, buying more equipment, whatever it may be, but it is definitely a game-changer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you wonder how long the runway this has, given the fact that we've already seen a real impact from the tax cut plan, but it's expected to keep having an impact over the year.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I think the stock prices obviously get revised immediately, but as far as small business, what is the outlook in terms of how it changes this coming year?</p><p>MILLER: Well, small business, it's a local business and so what we are seeing across the United States is optimism. The headline is that we've seen more optimistic, people are very positive about the outlook in their local economies as well as the national economy, and that's a good sign for business ahead.</p><p>HEGSETH: How often do you hear about regulation or the reduction thereof and how significant that's been?</p><p>MILLER: It is, I mean, it is significant. The less bureaucracy you have, the less red tapes, so to speak. It's better for business and they are able to be more efficient, they're able to get through and understand what the impacts are on their business. So this is a positive for small business owners, it can be very complex and then trying to understand how to run your business, on top of that, how to understand the regulations, it's a lot for one person to take.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How does this optimism, though, translate into ramping up economic growth in this country whether it's through hiring, raises or investment in their businesses?</p><p>MILLER: Well, we are seeing all of that. The one thing that I would point to, is there is a war for talent out there. Small business owners, I talk to them all the time, across the country, they want to hire, they want to attract good employees, and the right employees that are quality and that understand their business and can add value to them.</p><p>And what's happening is it's just -- because of such a great economy and the very low unemployment, we are not able to find qualified workers in the small business camps. And so you've got to look at benefits, you've got to look at all sights -- sorts of other things to attract the right workers into the small businesses.</p><p>FREEMAN: So, Sharon, we are seeing this surge in confidence and optimism among the business owners, but generally, we haven't seen, over the last year, a lot of loan growth or maybe not as much as we'd like to see, do you see that changing now or are there reasons why we shouldn't be concerned even if the loan growth isn't off the charts?</p><p>MILLER: Well, I think there's -- you know, there's different segments with loan growth. And so in the small business face Bank of America, we are seeing demand for lending. Our lending is strong and I would say that, you know, when small businesses get started, generally, they will start with either personal savings, perhaps a credit card, and then they are able to get more traditional financing.</p><p>We also partner with community development financial institutions for these small businesses that may not be eligible for traditional financing. But we are seeing demand both in our traditional lines and loans as well as our health care, so lending to dentists, doctors, veterinarians.</p><p>HEGSETH: Sharon, but not all small businesses are created equal, some sectors are struggling, may not feel optimism, where do you see the most optimism and what places are not?</p><p>MILLER: Well, I think, in the technology section, and certainly, there was a question in our survey that was all around, what do you think about digital payments? And half of our small business owners felt like over the next five years, that's all they would be taking.</p><p>So instead of checks and instead of the way we may pay traditionally today, especially to small business in the local (INAUDIBLE) landscaper, you know your dry cleaner. They are talking about all digital payments which is, you know, quite -- there's a trickle down there because there's people that have to build those types of capabilities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you've got nearly one-third of all small businesses using smart phones --</p><p>MILLER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: to process digital payments, that's interesting. Are the small businesses having their access to credit? I mean, how is that going in terms of business getting the credit that they need? That was one issue that Linda McMahon brought up when she joined us, the Small Business Administrator, earlier in the week.</p><p>MILLER: Yes. And there is access to capital, I mean, that's something that we want to make sure they were out there, we're teaching people how to get access to capital and what you need to do when you're starting a small business, how you have to have revenues that are going to be able to repay that loan, so access to capital can come in more ways than just a traditional loan and there's education, there's training.</p><p>We are very focused on women, we just announced, last week, the Institute for Women's Entrepreneurship and Bank of America partnership with Cornell University, this is all about our attempt to make sure that we're giving the education, the training and the information necessary for people to get access to capital. Many people don't know how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, compare women start-ups to male start-ups, what's higher?</p><p>MILLER: Women are starting businesses at twice the rate of men with half the capital. And so, it say, it's definitely a great opportunity for us to partner. We will be, in fact, at Times Square, this week. We are posting poster love for Small Business. We want to make sure that, you know, if you like a small business, go online, give a good review for them because that's going to help them in the local economy. So there's a lot of opportunity for us to support small businesses and it's good for the local communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, what's a small business? How do you identify that?</p><p>MILLER: Less than five million in revenues and 100 employees or less, so these are small businesses. This is the heart of America.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They have to be sitting there, though (INAUDIBLE) requirement to provide health insurance to go away which the government has yet to repeal the employer mandate, we got rid of individual mandate. Is that -- is that on their wish list and high on it?</p><p>MILLER: Listen, health care is the number one concern. It continues to be in every report. We survey and every survey we take of small business owners across the United States, it was number one concern, this time, too. So the cost of health care, the complexity and a lot of other things, so health care is definitely the top of the list.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, they are using digital. They are not feeling the crypto craze, though, right? That's also something we should point out. There are two percent of small business owners believe crypto will be relevant to them but aren't sure how. Bitcoin has been all the buzz in Wall Street, obviously, in some quarters. It's not gaining traction for small business.</p><p>MILLER: No, it's not. It's not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there, Sharon, great to see you.</p><p>MILLER: Thank you, great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. We'll keep watching, Sharon Miller, joining us there. We'll take a break. When we come back, supporters of President Trump can get the boot from a bar, that's the ruling of a New York City judge, the outrage, coming up this morning. And then, forget dad jeans, Adidas is launching dad sneakers, but dad might walk away when he sees the price of these no frills kicks, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big news from Ford Motor, the company putting a big part of its car business in the rear-view mirror. Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. OK. So, if you like Ford Sedans, you better get one before they're all gone, Martha. Ford says that they're going to stop making the Fiesta sub-compact, the Fusion mid-sized Sedan, and the Tourist large Sedan. After that, Ford's only going to have two cars left in the line-up -- the mustang, of course, and a new hatchback of the focus active. The plan is to introduce more trucks and SUVs, which have been more popular with buyers, frankly. Shares of Ford are down about 12 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, Chipotle is looking at options in an effort to try and turn around their business. Brian Nickel, who's the company's news CEO says that Chipotle is considering a few different things. Maybe they're going to franchise, maybe some new menu items, they're thinking about drive-throughs now. Shares up more than 10 percent in extended trading after their first- quarter results came in better than expected. The stock is up 15 percent so far this year. They're in recovery mode.</p><p>Well, get this. So, this is one of those only-in-New-York-stories. Supporters of President Trump can legally be thrown out of a bar because of their political beliefs, that's according to a Manhattan judge who ruled in favor of a that refuse to serve a man wearing a make America great hat. The judge says, current laws don't protect against political discrimination. This happened just after President Trump's inauguration. After the guy complained about room service, the Trump supporter says staff told him that he wasn't welcome there anymore, yes.</p><p>And then there's this, Adidas is getting into the dad shoe craze because, apparently, there's dad shoe craze out there. They have a new sneaker called the young one, which is reminiscent of the 1990s shoe. It's got a kind of a chunky design, the sole is thick, it's got suede, it's got nylon. This is basically all the rage right now, Maria. So, the retro shoe, if you want to pay the price, $130. So, to be a cool dad is not so cool and cheap, but there you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, let's do a survey. We got some cool dads on the set right now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's not get crazy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HEGSETH: I mean, if you're wearing the dad shoe, I think you've given up on life. And it's not a good-looking shoe. I'm sorry, Adidas. I like Adidas. But all white is just too much for me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. So, that's not a cool dad shoe. What do you think, James?</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't know. Wearing something that's specifically marketed as the dad shoe, I'm not sure just how cool that really would be, but -- I don't need it. I tend to avoid exercise.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you have an injury -- a running injury, there's a brand of shoe called HOKA. Do you know what I'm talking about? H-O-K-A. They're big gigantic, chunky, and hideous. They're terrific athletic shoes and they're running shoes but they look kind of like that.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes. Well, you don't have to choose to wear them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're great shoes, by the way. I was talking about the trend, ugly, expensive tennis shoe, I just found a pair of Balenciaga women's sneakers, they're only $900.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's Balenciaga.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In case anybody has a bathtub full of cash and is really stupid.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will take a break on that note. Coming up, the wait is finally over. It is NFL draft day on FOX. We're taking you inside the private NFL owners' meeting about national anthem protest. Sports, is next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Lebron James does it again, another highlight to add to James' real. Jared Max with highlights. Wild night in NBA Playoffs last night, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER: Maria, the Cavaliers and the Pacers were tied 2-2, in their first-round playoff series. Tied 95-95 under 10 seconds to play. Game five, Lebron, the stage is yours.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: James, two seconds, one second for the win.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lebron James delivers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: Of course, Lebron scores 44, 15 to 15 from the foul line. The Pacers' Victor Oladipo said he should've -- gotten a goal-tending call at the other end. But you know, Lebron hit the three-point shot at the other end. Cavs up, 3-2.</p><p>Lebron, not the highest scorer in the NBA Playoffs last night. Russell Westbrook was -- he had 45. The Thunder trailed the Jazz by 25 points in the third quarter, and then outscored Utah, 61-28, over the final 20.5 minutes. They win by eight. Thunder still alive, down 3-2.</p><p>Former President George Herbert-Walker Bush has been moved out of an ICU unit into a regular hospital room, and he is focused on basketball. A statement released says, \"President Bush naturally thanks everyone for their prayers and good wishes. He also wants to assure everyone that as good as he feels now, he's more focused on the Houston Rockets closing out their playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves than anything that landed him into the hospital.\" Well, President Bush should be smiling today. Houston Rockets won last night. They eliminated the Timberwolves in game five with ease, 122-104; 30 points for James Harden.</p><p>For the first time, we can say the NFL draft kicks off tonight on Fox 8:00 Eastern Time, AT&amp;T stadium outside of Dallas, the draft will begin, the Cleveland Browns select Pete Hegseth -- no, you to tune in to see what it's going to be. The Browns have the first and the fourth picks.</p><p>The New York Times obtained an audio recording of a meeting that NFL owners and select players last fall, after President Trump suggested that any player who kneeled for national anthem should be fired, well, Bob Kraft, owner of New England Patriots, who's reported to have given President Trump a Super Bowl ring apparently isn't entirely on the president's side.</p><p>According to the New York Times, Kraft was reportedly recorded saying at the meeting: \"The problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don't feel is in the best interest of America.\" Robert Kraft says, \"it's divisive and it's horrible.\" Over three hours of audio recordings coming out at that the New York Times have said to have listened to. You can imagine some of the comments that, you know, might've gone on in this meeting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this from a supporter. I mean, Bob Kraft has been supporter of the president.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes, yes! I mean, the whole meeting was supposed to be confidential which, of course, never happens. I'm surprised here that Bob Kraft say that. He was one of those that you felt like was probably frustrated with the anthem protest and felt like the solution was to just stand for the anthem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, he doesn't want lower ratings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can tell you one of the problems was though, is fewer and fewer players week after week were taking a knee during the national anthem. President Trump was still tweeting about it and drawing attention to it and trying to wit people into a frenzy over it, when it was less of a story if you were actually watching the game. And I think that the owners rightfully had problem with that.</p><p>MAX: Dagen, I think a lot of owners also found themselves in weird position because a game of politics, no pun intended, but here's something important from the president, but now they also have Rosters of 53. Jerry Jones found himself kneeling and then standing up -- almost like he didn't know what to do. All of a sudden, he was involved. So, not everybody -- it was a first time for everybody. Not that I'm giving him a pass, but I wonder why the Democrat --</p><p>HEGSETH: Yet it was (INAUDIBLE) in the off season. I mean, it still remains an issue, the NFL won't tackle and hasn't tackled yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, has Colin Kaepernick gotten a job yet?</p><p>MAX: No. The Seahawks, maybe. Whoever is the 14th pick of the third round. Pie 3-14, gets free pizza for a year from Pizza Hut.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The problem with any owner taking Colin Kaepernick on at this point is he's got a divisive figure, and it's not just for the fans, it's even in the locker room -- it's a distraction.</p><p>MAX: You're paying more than $25.00 for baggage fees.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's it, it's distraction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You need to focus on the game. Again, the owners, what are you going to do? Tell all these men that they can't take a knee? And that essentially violates their first amendment rights, you can't do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jared, thank you. Jared Max. Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or in radio SiriusXM 115. Be sure to catch the NFL draft live coverage tonight 8:00 p.m. Eastern.

Facebook shares are up 49% so far this year. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Political matters aren't the only challenge facing Facebook in 2020 however. Below are some of the key themes to watch next year. </p><p><br/>1. New Revenue Sources <br/></p><p>Facebook's core newsfeed isn't the crown jewel of its portfolio anymore, at least where its next wave of growth is concerned. Instagram and Stories, and even WhatsApp, are looking a lot more interesting these days to many growth-seeking investors. </p><p>Accordingly, Facebook's advertising products are evolving. Stories have evolved into a popular medium for sharing content among friends, both on Facebook and Instagram, and advertisers are beginning to better understand how to monetize these emerging forms of communication on Facebook. Interest in Stories will likely remain high next year, and Facebook will need to meet investor expectations on that front.</p><p>Although it's nascent, there is hope among investors that shopping and commerce will turn into a meaningful source of revenue, particularly on Instagram and WhatsApp. Analysts have noted that Instagram, as a visual-first medium that's increasingly popular among advertisers, is a natural fit for shopping. In November, Facebook  , a PayPal-esque peer-to-peer payments system that, if widely adopted, could make shopping through Facebook easier -- and potentially boost monetization potential across all of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. </p><p><br/>2. Problem Content <br/></p><p>Ever since Cambridge Analytica, Facebook has taken pains to inform people how its processes for purging fishy accounts, apps and other types of problematic content are improving. Recently, it said in a blog post that it removed 3.2 billion fake accounts in  It also broke out for the first time its content moderation efforts on Instagram versus core Facebook, saying that it deleted millions of pieces of content depicting child abuse and self-harm. </p><p>Progress on content moderation is a good thing, but it also doesn't come cheap. Facebook spends in the ballpark of $5 billion per year on safety, security and content moderation efforts, and that cost isn't likely to come down significantly anytime soon. On its third quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg told investors that \"I don't foresee any time in the near future that AI is going to make it so that the cost comes down...there's just so much content flowing through the system that we do need a lot of people looking at this. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon.\"</p><p>Relying on humans for content moderation comes with its own host of problems. Months ago, an investigation by The Verge into poor working conditions of Facebook contractors who moderate content sparked a stiff backlash. It's also an imperfect system, a game of whack-a-mole that will likely remain a liability for Facebook well into the future. </p><p><br/>3. Regulatory Headaches <br/></p><p>Facebook's Libra project was supposed to represent its next big innovation in financial services. Instead, it became a flash point for long-simmering ire towards the company for privacy-related infractions, political advertising, content moderation issues, and even its spotty record on civil rights. In two separate hearings, one with Facebook executive David Marcus and the other with CEO Mark Zuckberberg, lawmakers vented their frustrations with the social media firm's impact on society. </p><p>It's uncertain what form Libra will take when, or if, it launches as initially planned in 2020. If it does launch, it'll likely be a drastically scaled-down version of Facebook's original vision of a global digital currency with a large network of partners; after being told by lawmakers they could bear liability for problems with Libra, several major partners, such as PayPal  and Mastercard , withdrew their participation. </p><p>Beyond just Libra, however, regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere are keeping their eyes on Facebook. Facebook is one of several big tech companies facing an antitrust review by the DOJ, FTC and nearly all  , likely focusing on its data practices, acquisitions, and product development. In Europe, it faces potentially even greater pressures, including scrutiny into hate speech, stiff potential penalties for GDPR violations, and a new antitrust probe by the European Commission. Next year, it will have to reassure investors that regulatory pressures won't negatively impact its long-term prospects. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-15192010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR6-DT01-F00X-J2GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.

Investors have been concerned about the social media giant's slowing growth rate in a year when it has been under scrutiny for data privacy violations and its role in the spread of false and divisive messages by fake user accounts traced to Russian agents during U.S. election campaigns.On the strength side of the third quarter report: The company's profit of $5.14 billion, or $1.76 per share, exceeded Wall Street expectations, Reuters reported[3]. Although the number of daily users remained flat at 185 million in the United States and Canada, the company saw a rise of a million monthly users for the region.But Menlo Park, CA-based Facebook's revenue growth followed the pattern of deceleration the company had foretold as it released its second quarter[4] numbers in July, when the market reacted by stripping more than $100 billion from its market capitalization. In the third quarter, revenue rose 33 percent to $13.7 billion compared to the same period a year ago. But that was a decline from the revenue growth rate of 42 percent for the second quarter of this year.The third quarter brought Facebook the loss of a million users in Europe, where strict new data privacy regulations are giving users more control over the personal data collected and shared, and where government investigators have faulted the company for allowing third-party developers to extract user profiles without their consent. </p><p>The U.K.'s data privacy regulatorfined Facebook[5]$645,000 last week for violations that allowed 87 million user profiles to fall into the hands of outside companies, including political marketing firm Cambridge Analytica.In September, Facebook counted an average of 1.49 billion daily active users\u2014a 9 percent rise compared to the preceding year and an advance over the 1.47 billion reported for June. However, Facebook is seeing the most growth in geographic regions that bring in the least revenue. The average revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada is $27.61; in Europe, it's $8.82. For the Asian Pacific user, revenue is $2.67, and users in the rest of the world bring in an average of $1.82.'We may be close to saturation in developed countries while we continue to see growth in less developed countries,' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an earnings conference call Tuesday.Zuckerberg and other executives outlined a number of shifts and transitions that mark this period in Facebook's business trajectory. For one thing, the company has been increasing its expenditures to beef up security and reform its privacy practices. Zuckerberg said the company had lagged behind in such efforts in prior years, and added that he expects it won't be until the end of next year before 'we're as dialed in as we'd like to be.' But he said Facebook is making progress through measures like deploying artificial intelligence software to flag problem content such as terrorist messages and hate speech.Facebook is also trying to move users and advertisers into new formats that don't yet yield as much advertising revenue as its news feeds on Facebook and Instagram. The company is trying to foster growth in messaging and a style of social media sharing known as 'stories,' in which people describe moments in their lives. Facebook is working with advertisers to design ads to blend in with these formats, which Zuckerberg says encourage more social interaction than activities like watching viral videos that don't necessarily reflect the core interests of users.The earnings news comes as Facebook is under a number of other pressures:\u2014The U.K. government announced a new 'digital services tax' of 2 percent on the revenues drawn from the U.K. by search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces that make more than $638 million globally, MIT Technology Review reported[6]. The tax, set to take effect in 2020, might inspire other jurisdictions such as the European Union to impose similar levies.\u2014When U.K. regulators last week fined Facebook $645,000, it was for violations of older privacy codes. But future fines for similar violations under the nation's new privacy laws could far exceed that. Under the U.K.'s Data Protection Act 2018 and the EU's stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies that violate data privacy protection requirements can be fined as much as $21.7 million, or 4 percent of a company's annual global revenue.\u2014Shareholders have been benefiting from Facebook's ability to generate billions in ad revenue by offering advertisers the ability to target ads to selected portions of the population, based on the personal data Facebook has collected about them. But this year, Facebook has lost market cap as well as user growth in high-revenue regions such as Europe and the United States, as its impact on privacy and the public discourse of nations draws increasing scrutiny. And some shareholders are calling the company on the carpet.This week, impact investor Arjuna Capital[7] and New York State's big pension fund filed a shareholder proposal[8] calling on Facebook to lay out in writing how it plans to fend off data breaches and fake users, while better guarding its network from being used to spread misinformation, incite hatred, improperly interfere with elections, and suppress legitimate free speech.New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli joined Arjuna in the shareholder filing, acting as trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which manages the retirement accounts of more than a million state and local government employees and retirees. The fund, which managed assets of $209.2 billion as of June 30, is the third largest U.S. public pension fund. Based on the fund's figures, the pension fund lost roughly $257 million due to the drop in the value of Facebook's shares since the beginning of the year.\u2014An overall bear market: Since Oct. 1, the Nasdaq composite index is down about 12 percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen about 8 percent.Photo 'Money!' by Flickr user Tracy O[9].

It's a big deal because the decline was in Europe, which has just introduced the strict new GDPR privacy regulation. It shows that regulation is capable of curtailing Facebook's massive growth and capping its revenue. The worst is yet to come because the full impact of GDPR is yet to kick in. </p><p>Facebook saw a decline inmonthly active users for the first time in its history, the company reported during its dramatic second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Any decline is significant and bad news for a company generally considered to be a rocket ship of growth. But what should cause some alarm is where the decline happened, and whether it will get worse. According to Facebook, European monthly active users dropped by 1 million between the first and second quarters, falling from 377 million to 376 million.It's the only region where Facebook saw declines, with the biggest region, Asia-Pacific, jumping from 873 million users to 894 million users. The US stayed flat quarter over quarter at 241 million monthly active users. Facebook blamed the decline on \"currency headwinds\" and Europe's new privacy-focused regulation, the GDPR. \"GDPR was an important moment for our industry,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts. \"We did see a decline in monthly actives in Europe, down by about 1 million people as a result.\" GDPR was specifically designed to bring the big tech firms to heel, and regulates how companies use people's data[1]. Executives noticeably dodged talking about the ongoing impact of GDPR beyond the second quarter. \"[We] don't have any update on trends,\" said Wehner. \"We had indicated in the first quarter that we would expect to see a decline. We're not providing any guidance on [monthly active users] and [daily active users] in Europe on this call.\" There are multiple signs that Europe won't recover.Europe only rolled out its new privacy rules in late May \u2014 so Facebook will continue to feel its impact into the next quarterGDPR only kicked in on May 25, two-thirds of the way through Facebook's second quarter. Facebook began showing its privacy notifications around May 24 in order to comply with the new rules.[2] Facebook's thesis is that these notifications turned off its European users, who then spent less time on the platform and have perhaps become more privacy-conscious. Given that GDPR only impacted some of Facebook's second quarter, there could be knock-on effects in the third quarter. The decline shows that Facebook, which seemed to be infallible, isn't completely invincible against regulation. And whether Facebook is even properly complying with GDPR is under some contention[3]. At the moment, Facebook tells users who don't share certain types of data that they won't be able to use parts of its platform. That goes against the spirit of GDPR, which says companies can't penalise users for not sharing information. As Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser put it: \"Our view is that the company is far from 'out of the woods' as the bundling of consent for Facebook to use consumer data with access to the platform appears to be an aggressive interpretation of GDPR, and one that might be more subject to eventual regulatory action. \"While those actions might take time to play out, it is still possible that threatened fines associated with GDPR to Facebook or other sellers of advertising could also have the effect of spooking advertisers into changing how they use data with media owners.\" In other words, a court could find that Facebook hasn't complied with GDPR, fine the company, and then force even stricter privacy measures that impact its European user base even more.Losing money and users in its second-biggest market would be very bad news for FacebookEurope has, up until now, been an extremely stable market for Facebook. It's the second biggest by active users, behind Asia-Pacific, and the second biggest in how much money the company makes per user, behind the US. This is how much Facebook makes per user in its biggest markets: US: $25.91 Europe: $8.76 Asia: $2.62That's why Europe, despite being smaller than Asia-Pacific by user numbers, actually brought in more revenue. Europe made $3.3 billion in revenue, versus $2.3 billion from Asia.This is why any sign of decline in Europe is so drastic. While revenue and average revenue per user looks intact for now, any sign of cratering engagement will scare advertisers away from Facebook's core platform. Facebook appears to know that, with COO Sheryl Sandberg noting that advertisers were still adapting to the new rules. \"GDPR has not had a revenue impact, but we also recognize it wasn't fully rolled out this quarter,\" she told analysts. \"It was very encouraging for us to see that the vast majority of people affirmed that they want us to use information, including from the websites they visit, to make their ads more relevant. But, as we look further out, we recognize that there's still risk, and we're going to watch closely.\"NOW WATCH: What people get wrong about superfoods[4]See Also: Instagram is booming, and investors are salivating over Facebook as a result[5]China has withdrawn approval for Facebook's new venture in the country, where it remains banned[6]'Marvel Powers United' is unlike any other VR game you've played before[7] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-is-gdpr-regulation-explained-2018-4?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-is-gdpr-regulation-explained-2018-4?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-facebook-updates-and-settings-review-means-2018-4?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-facebook-updates-and-settings-review-means-2018-4?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/25/facebook-google-gdpr-complaints-eu-consumer-rights\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/25/facebook-google-gdpr-complaints-eu-consumer-rights</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-people-get-wrong-about-superfoods-nutrition-health-acai-goji-turmeric-quinoa-2018-6?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/what-people-get-wrong-about-superfoods-nutrition-health-acai-goji-turmeric-quinoa-2018-6?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-q2-earnings-preview-what-to-expect-instagram-2018-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-q2-earnings-preview-what-to-expect-instagram-2018-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-government-withdraws-approval-facebook-subsidiary-2018-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-government-withdraws-approval-facebook-subsidiary-2018-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/oculus-marvel-powers-united-thanos-black-panther-captain-america-deadpool-2018-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/oculus-marvel-powers-united-thanos-black-panther-captain-america-deadpool-2018-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BZIN1056451532611574010251764500202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BZIN-5352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWK-SN41-F03R-N4NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1111\"/><timeReceived>1:26 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Insider</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 26, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For decades, the tobacco industry denied that smoking causes lung cancer, that nicotine is addictive and that it targets the young.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In public, the industry presented itself as the supplier of a legal product used by responsible adults for a widely enjoyed social habit. But behind the scenes, this was a predatory industry engaged in what campaigners Clive Bates and Andy Rowell have described as \"the most astonishing systematic corporate deceit of all time\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet its ability to cause public harm pales in comparison to a new threat of unprecedented size and scale that has emerged in recent years, one that we are only just beginning to understand: social media and specifically its negative impact on the mental health of its users.</p><p>Facebook criticised for domination of digital revenues</p><p>I am the founder, CEO and chairman of WANdisco plc, a public software company jointly headquartered in Silicon Valley and Sheffield, and I have spent two decades at the leading edge of the technology industry. </p><p>It saddens me that some of the finest minds of my generation have applied themselves to the creation of a purposefully addictive platform that I'm convinced is driving a new mental health epidemic.</p><p>With nearly three billion active users, it is even bigger than Big Tobacco. The UK government seems to be waking up to the dangers and has just finished consulting on its Online Harms White Paper, which includes plans to crack down on terrorist propaganda, child abuse and bullying online through the creation of a new regulator. I believe we need to go further and look at the effects of social media per se on mental health and wellbeing, especially among young people.</p><p>Most of us have family members and friends who have suffered mental health problems, either caused or made worse by social media. Even Facebook has questioned whether simply spending time on social media might be bad for our mental health. </p><p>Why posting about Brexit on Facebook and Twitter could get you in trouble with the police</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg's colossus had its own Big Tobacco moment in late 2017 when billionaire early investor Sean Parker admitted that Facebook's inventors consciously exploited a vulnerability in human psychology. \"God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains,\" he said.</p><p>The Government has an absolute duty to find out. </p><p>Ministers might have attracted headlines with their White Paper, but Big Tech, like Big Tobacco, has an army of well-connected and expensive lobbyists, including the former UK Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg, who will be working to influence parliament to protect their lucrative business model and water down any proposals in the name of safeguarding innovation, the digital economy and freedom of speech.</p><p>Let us be aware of the damage that is being done. According to the Royal Society for Public Health, 91 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds use the internet for social networking; social media has been described as more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol; rates of anxiety and depression in young people have risen 70 per cent in the past 25 years; social media use is linked with increased rates of anxiety, depression and poor sleep; and cyber bullying is a growing problem with seven in 10 young people saying they have experienced it.</p><p>Regulation is a positive first step in combating these problems but in the case of Big Tobacco, it hasn't stopped smoking from killing an estimated seven million people every year. In spite of everything we now know about smoking, Big Tobacco still wields enormous power and remains a global player with a base of more than one billion customers across the world. </p><p>Like Big Tobacco, Big Tech has a closely guarded business model, which generates billions of dollars in profits. It uses legal loopholes to reduce its tax liabilities. It pleads freedom but evades its responsibilities. </p><p>Its business activities place strain on our cash-strapped NHS.</p><p>We need more research into the correlation between social media and mental health and through the David and Jane Richards Family Foundation, our computer science and ecology charity, we are prepared to help fund it. </p><p>It is time we fully understood the true impact that Big Tech's platforms and secretive algorithms are having on young minds, for the sake of everyone's future.</p><p>David Richards is the founder and chief executive of Sheffield-based technology company WANdisco.

The company plans to demolish five older buildings to make way for the new one. The total project, which will also include a park and a sky bridge to connect the new building with another one, is estimated to cost $303 million. </p><p>Facebook's Silicon Valley campus will soon include another building designed by star architect Frank Gehry. The social networking giant filed permits last month to begin construction of the four-story, 464,000-square-foot building at its Menlo Park, California, headquarters. As part of the development, Facebook plans to demolish five other buildings and construct a 3500-spot parking garage. The company has already begun demolishing those buildings, spokesman Jamil Walker said in an email. Walker also confirmed thepermit applications, which were originally uncovered by BuildZoom[1], a web service that keeps tabs on construction permits and offers building contractor recommendations. Menlo Park's City Council approved Facebook's overall plan for the site in November, Walker noted. \"We value the ongoing partnership with the community as we work together to revitalize an aging industrial site and speed up the delivery of the community benefits promised in our development agreement,\" Walker said. The plan includes a new open space, he said. Facebook also plans to build a bridge that will connect a neighborhood just south of its campus to San Francisco Bay, which is just to its north, he said. The new Gehry-designed building, dubbed Building 22 or MPK 22, will be constructed on the western portion of Facebook's campus one its permit is issued. Facebook estimated the project would cost $303 million, not including furniture and equipment for the building. The plan includes a sky bridge that will connect the new building to the campus' Building 21. That building, which is already under construction, and the main headquarters building on the campus were also designed by Gehry, who is best known for his stainless steel-clad curvilinear buildings, including Los Angeles' Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain. One of the five buildings Facebook plans to demolish will remain standing until it completes Building 22. After the new building is completed, Facebook will replace the old one with a park and recharging facilities for Facebook's shuttle buses and trams.NOW WATCH: How a woman from the 1800s became the first computer programmer[2]See Also: Here's why you should stop using Venmo, and start using Facebook Messenger for paying back your friends[3]London mayor Sadiq Khan ripped into big tech over fake news, online abuse, and regulatory arbitrage[4]Facebook removed a new Android security app that critics said unfairly collects private data[5] SEE ALSO:Facebook is building a village that will include housing, a grocery store and a hotel[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buildzoom.com/property-info/1-facebook-way-menlo-park-ca?utm_swu=5285..._medium=email..._source=reporter..._campaign=permits\">https://www.buildzoom.com/property-info/1-facebook-way-menlo-park-ca?utm_swu=5285..._medium=email..._source=reporter..._campaign=permits</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-first-computer-programmer-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-first-computer-programmer-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-messenger-venmo-pay-friends-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-messenger-venmo-pay-friends-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/sadiq-khan-criticised-facebook-twitter-uber-google-fake-news-abuse-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/sadiq-khan-criticised-facebook-twitter-uber-google-fake-news-abuse-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-onavo-removes-bolt-lock-from-google-play-store-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-onavo-removes-bolt-lock-from-google-play-store-2018-3?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-building-employee-housing-silicon-valley-headquarters-2017-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-building-employee-housing-silicon-valley-headquarters-2017-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BZIN1056451521152867112251766500120</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BZIN-5352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWB-VS61-JCMN-Y050-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"689\"/><timeReceived>10:27 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Insider</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As Bickert pointed out in her Jan. 8 statement to an Energy and Commerce subcommittee, \"Facebook is a community of more than 2 billion people, spanning countries, cultures and languages across the globe.\" That's a quarter of the world's population.</p><p>The firm has massive monopoly power to influence public opinion.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims that Facebook has adopted this policy because it is committed to protecting \"free expression,\" and that the company should not be the arbiter of truth.</p><p>In fact, this policy has nothing to do with protecting free expression. Instead, it is aimed at letting Facebook make hundreds of millions of dollars showing ads on its platform, even if they're untrue.</p><p>Under his policy, for instance, Facebook would presumably allow a candidate to spend hundreds of millions of dollars claiming that his or her opponent ran a pedophile ring in a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C. That outrageous conspiracy theory actually circulated widely about Hillary Clinton in right-wing circles before the last election - but was never circulated as paid advertising. Now, Facebook is saying that if you want to spend a fortune to promote that conspiracy, they are happy to take your money.</p><p>In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi excoriated Facebook: \"They have said very blatantly, very clearly that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people with money from God knows where.\"</p><p>It is true that under federal law, internet platforms like Facebook are not liable for what third parties post on their sites. But Facebook still reserves the right to remove posts that violate its rules, or so-called community standards. In fact, it does serve the cause of free speech for those who post on platforms like Facebook to be subject only to the same limitations on speech that our legal system has determined apply in other arenas of life.</p><p>People should be able to speak freely about their views - but should not be allowed to advocate violence or to cry \"fire\" in a crowded theater, because the exercise of that free speech right impinges on other critical rights. As things stands now, however, the same does not apply to Facebook when it takes money from a person or organization to advertise their points of view. Once Facebook takes money to promote a candidate or cause, the company becomes an agent of the campaign or organization promoting that message. And once it is an agent of a campaign or cause, it should be held responsible and liable for ads that contain provable lies.</p><p>Facebook should be held to the same standards as TV networks like CNN and CBS, since it is really exactly the same kind of broadcast service.</p><p>Its refusal to do so opens a massive opportunity for conspiracy theorists and demagogues to spend fortunes promoting provably false allegations with absolute impunity. And the sad fact is that if even the most outrageous lie is repeated often enough, large numbers of people will come to believe it. Donald Trump understands that.</p><p>Zuckerberg is increasingly concerned about the growing movement to regulate and break up big tech, especially virtual monopolies like Facebook. The president could do a lot to protect Zuckerberg's empire - especially if he is reelected. Democratic candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have openly advocated breaking up Facebook and other big tech companies, cause Zuckerberg special concern.</p><p>All of that makes you wonder what was said in Zuckerberg's private dinner with Trump last fall at the White House.</p><p>It is impossible to overstate the danger that Facebook's policy poses to American democracy. It opens up a gigantic breach in the bulwark of our democratic institutions - and to the integrity of the next election.</p><p>Ordinary citizens need to take matters into their own hands. That's why a number of major progressive organizations are considering a nationwide petition campaign to demand that Facebook refuse to run advertising that contains objectively false statements. We need to join them.</p><p>Robert Creamer, a partner at Democracy Partners, has been a political organizer and strategist for five decades and was a consultant in the last three Democratic presidential campaigns. He is the author of \"Listen to Your Mother: Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can Win.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMREC-wtr-2093086516</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMREC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2M-MGY1-JC3H-01PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Record News (Wichita Falls, TX) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Times Record News (Wichita Falls, Texas)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us live from Cannes this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, June 18th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at just 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook's crypto, the social media giant creates a new digital currency, sending the stock up in the premarket. I'll bet talking live his morning to the head of the new cryptocurrency later this hour. Plus, find out the major companies already on-board with this. Stock is up better than 2 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are higher this morning. Take a look at futures, indicating a higher opening for the broader market ahead of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting. The Dow Industrials now at the high of the morning, up 114 points, S&amp;P futures up 15, and the Nasdaq futures are up 68 points.</p><p>The fed is beginning its meeting today. We are going to be scrutinizing what the Fed says tomorrow, 2:15 Eastern when we get the news from Jay Powell. We're not expecting a rate cut tomorrow but we are expecting some language to suggest maybe we get one later on in the year.</p><p>There's yesterday's close, also firmer. DowIndustrials were up 23 points, S&amp;P was up 2 points and the Nasdaq was up 48 percent. Communications stocks, energy stocks really drove the move yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, money is moving into stocks there as well. Take a look at European indices across the board higher. FT 100 up 57 points, three-quarters of a percent. CAC 40 in Paris up 1.5 percent, 75 points. Dax Index in Germany up 1.25 percent, that is 148 points higher.</p><p>In Asia overnight, Hong Kong did well. Take a look at the Asian indices. It was mostly higher with the exception of Japan. Hang Seng was up 1 percent after all of those protests. We've got more on that this morning as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, tourist deaths, a New Jersey man is the latest to die in the Dominican Republic. This story is a mystery. And we are going to be digging deep into what has gone on.</p><p>Then dozens of Jimmy Buffet fans claimed they were sickened during their trip. Take a look.</p><p>Trouble for Boeing this morning, the aircraft maker recording no new plane orders at the Paris air show. Meanwhile, you've got competitors seeing blood and upping up their game.</p><p>Then the frightening video of a flight hitting major turbulence. All that coming up.</p><p>Plus a real life iron man. Check this out. A look at the bulletproof suit that has been built and it can actually fly. Find out who made it.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Cheryl Casone in New York along with CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.</p><p>Ladies, good to see you this morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>I'll tell you what. The Fed's two-day meeting is starting, oil isn't higher and it's a sunny day in France. What else can you ask for?</p><p>BARTIROMO: This view is like the million dollar view behind me. You've got yachts lined up in the harbor here in Cannes. But we've been focused on marketing and on advertising here at Cannes Lions. They call this, Cheryl, the most creative week of the year for the media industry because you've got the creatives and the chief marketing officers coming to try to drum up business and give us a look at the year ahead in terms of what their advertising platforms look like.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. And how do they get to that younger consumer, that younger viewer, that younger reader, that customer --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>CASONE: -- that's what's so fascinating because obviously digital media has changed everything in our world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You're absolutely right. And it doesn't matter what brand you are -- they're all facing that challenge.</p><p>And Lindsey -- this is another indicator of the economy, right because if businesses are sitting on cash, that means there's some uncertainty over there or if they're spending more ad dollars, that could be a positive indicator. How do you see the broad economy backdrop right now -- Lindsey?</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Right. I think you're getting some great indicators out of all of your interviews yesterday, today and the rest of this week. So (INAUDIBLE) CEO talking about how ad spend is up. We did see some cap ex numbers showing some signs of strength over the last couple of months.</p><p>The economy is doing really well and the consumer, it's being driven by a really resilient consumer here. Retail sales last week were really outstanding. The important thing there was that April numbers were also revised up and May numbers were solid.</p><p>So that is pushing GDP expectations for the second quarter above 2 percent, the Atlanta GDP now estimated is at 2.2 percent, up from 1.4 percent before that report.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and I know that the Atlanta fed changes pretty often in terms of its expectations. But the Fed is beginning the two-day meeting today. We're not expecting a cut in rates today but we'll see what happens down the road.</p><p>You've got to wonder what the 10 year is telling you, right. I mean you've got interest rates continuing at rock bottom levels.</p><p>CASONE: And you know, right now, we haven't seen a lot of action in the 10 year this week but it was certainly a market end indicator of volatility going back about a month ago. And I also think too, if you start to see more interest in the safety of bonds, that could be another sign that the Fed's going to have to look at.</p><p>I'm sure they're going to talk about all this today. You know, Lindsey brought this up to me on set during a commercial break. We're going to have that press conference tomorrow from Jay Powell. So that could be -- the Q&amp;A part -- he's going to be asked about the President, he's going to be asked about the tariffs. I mean I can't wait to see how he responds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. What do you think the messaging out of the Fed, Lindsey, will be when Jay Powell takes the podium tomorrow?</p><p>BELL: I mean it's going to be tough for him. He's going to have to tap dance around a lot of difficult questions, I'm sure. But I think the message is going to be that the Fed is willing to stand by the markets in case the tariff situation escalates and it impacts the global economic environment. So I think the market will be reassured by that.</p><p>You also saw by the way the ECB came out today and Draghi is out there saying that he's willing to stand by and make changes should the economic environment weaken there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. They're all standing by, ready to act, should things turn lower. We'll see that.</p><p>So far, I'm really not seeing evidence that things are slowing down all that much with the exception of the purchasing manager's index, the PMI certainly. We'll keep watching that.</p><p>And joining the conversation this morning, we've got the head of Calibra at Facebook, David Marcus is joining us this morning. They are launching a new digital currency. So you want to hear that. Philip Morris International chief operating officer Jacek Olczak is also with us this morning to give us his sense of the global story. The global chief marketing officer at Lego Julia Goldin joining us. Along with former press secretary under President Trump and America First Action senior advisor Sean Spicer here. The host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO\" weighs in as well, Stuart will join us later on in the show.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've a big two hours right now.</p><p>And President Trump just tweeted, here's what the President is saying this morning. \"Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar, making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the United States. They've been getting away with this for years, along with China and others,\" writes the President.</p><p>And of course this is a key point that the President makes, because oftentimes when there is stress, these countries, whether it is Mario Draghi in the E.U. or the President of China -- Lindsey, they'll devalue their currency.</p><p>BELL: Oh, yes. China has been -- they've been doing this for quite some time now. And you know, it's an offset to the tariffs that we have on Chinese goods coming into the U.S. It makes those goods cheaper for us. So it's a little bit of a relief for the consumer.</p><p>But it is an unfair practice. Currency should really purely be driven by free markets.</p><p>CASONE: And Maria -- we should add that European markets really rose this morning on these comments by Mario Draghi. I mean markets love stimulus and they love low interest rates and he's giving them what they want it seems.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And there's the rally you're seeing in the European indices. No doubt the President will address this at his kickoff to the road to 2020.</p><p>That's our top story right now. President Trump is kicking off his new campaign in Orlando, Florida today. Tens of thousands of people are expected to be at that rally, many waiting overnight for a chance to get into the rally to see the President. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATE JENSEN, TRUMP SUPPORTER: I'm a Trump supporter. I think it's important to come and support him and show him that we are behind him 100 percent and approve of his agenda.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love Trump. I do. I love what he does as far as military families. We have lost some loved ones. So I really appreciate how he has taken care of the family members, the service members, the wounded warriors, the gold star families -- all of them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hopefully he just sticks with the promises that he's made. He continues and just looking for another great four years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former pollster for Trump presidential campaign, pollster at McLaughlin and Associates, president and partner Jim McLaughlin. Jim-- it's good to see you. Thanks so much for being here this morning.</p><p>JIM MCLAUGHLIN, POLLSTER, MCLAUGHLIN AND ASSOCIATES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your take on the President's chances for 2020 as he kicks off his new campaign today?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well, peace and prosperity usually wins elections and right now we've got a lot of prosperity. So I think his chances are really, really good right now.</p><p>And you know what's interesting? Last week, you know, forget about all the polls that are out there because I've got be honest with you, and I say this as a pollster. A lot of those polls right now they're totally irrelevant so far out from election day.</p><p>But the truth is, look at those three economic models including one that was done from an economist that worked for President Obama, they all said they thought not only was Donald Trump going to win, but he was going to win overwhelmingly. So that's very interesting out there and it's a great sign for President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But even though you're seeing all of these attacks on the President daily by the Democrats, they want to impeach him, they're completely ignoring any positive impact of his economic policies, for example.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. And that's why it's so important that the President is doing the announcement now.</p><p>It was perfect timing to be quite honest with you, because it's right before the first Democratic debates and it's going to set up the contrast.</p><p>Because the contrast is going to be Donald Trump, historic economy, wages are going up, jobs are going up, the most recent report where we talked about, it was you actually have -- there were more job openings out there for the 14th straight month than there are jobs to be filled.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: So it's telling you right now how strong that economy is and that's the contrast he wants to take.</p><p>And you look at the Democrats, watch the Democrats at their debates, they're going to be calling for higher taxes. And the average American understands that. Middle class America knows that higher taxes are job killers. And that's the contrast that the President wants from now until Election Day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, I don't get that. You've got to, you know, explain this to me. We know that the President's tax legislation and lower taxes actually put a spark in the economy. We saw 4.2 percent growth last year in one quarter.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're talking about 3.1 percent growth in the first quarter of this year. So how is it that the Democrats think that coming into office, raising taxes, is going to be a positive for the economy when we just saw the impact of the opposite?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: They have a big problem. They have an extreme radical liberal base that thinks this class warfare argument, going after the corporations, going afte3r the job creators, going after the 1 percent, they think helps them.</p><p>And while it may help them in a Democratic primary it hurts them with middle class America. Because people understand, when you talk about -- you know, the Democrats always say they're going to tax the rich. But the truth of the matter is, they get it that it's going to be small businesses and the middle class that are going to get the bulk of those tax increases and that's what's going to hurt the economy. And you know what, that's a great contrast for the President between now and election day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You make a good point. But the Democrats are talking health care. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is vowing that Democrats will fight relentlessly to stop President Trump from repealing Obamacare. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: The President and some on the other side of the aisle have had scores of bills to eliminate the Affordable Care Act and we had to fight it every time to save it and then build it up bigger and grow it.</p><p>Right now, we are in court with the President of the United States. The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. It's a place where the Justice Department is supposed to support the law of the land. Instead, the President has decided that instead of supporting the law of the land, he will overturn the law of the land.</p><p>It just doesn't make sense. It's not even -- it isn't even faithful to our belief as religious people. But nonetheless, we're in this fight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that resonating -- Jim? I mean obviously healthcare is one of the top priorities for 2020. The President says that he's going to be rolling out a new healthcare plan in a couple months but we don't know what that will be. He says it is going to be a key focus of his re-election campaign, though.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: That clip that you just showed shows a real tension within the Democratic Party right now because most of the Democrats that are running for president right now, they're not supporting Obamacare. They're the ones that want to repeal and replace Obamacare with things like Medicare for all, which we all know is going to mean Medicare for none.</p><p>The interesting thing is the Republicans have done really well in the 2010 and the 2014 elections when they ran against Obamacare. And I think you're going to see the President do that again.</p><p>And what he's going to do is introduce some proposals that make healthcare more affordable, more accessible because that's what the American people are looking for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You would think so. Jim -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Thank you. Always a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jim McLaughlin joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, more trouble this morning for Boeing as one of the top competitors, airbus, lays the ground work for its longest-range single aisle plane yet. We will tell you about it.</p><p>And then Crypto craze, Facebook officially announcing the highly anticipated details behind the launch of its digital currency.</p><p>We're going to get into it. I'll be speaking with Facebook's head of Calibra, David Marcus on what's in store for the future of Facebook and digital currency. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Now this. Another American dies in the Dominican Republic. Lauren Simonetti with the details on this mysterious story -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: The State Department Maria -- confirm that the body of a 55-year-old American tourist was found in the Dominican Republic. The New Jersey Man discovered last Thursday in his hotel, the cause of death has not been revealed. He's the ninth American to die in the country within the past year and-a-half.</p><p>Plus, dozens of tourists from Oklahoma say they got sick during a trip to the Caribbean nation back in April. They were part of a Jimmy Buffet fan group. Some of them testing positive for salmonella.</p><p>A scary moments for passengers on a flight to France. Severe turbulence injuring 10 passenger mid-air. 120 people were on-board this rocky ALK (ph) flight as drinks went flying through the air. A flight attendant's head smacked on the plane's ceiling at one point. The plane was heading from Kosovo. It did land safely in France, only minor injuries, believe it or not, reported as you watch that chaotic video.</p><p>Timing is everything especially when it comes to air travel. Forbes is ranking the fastest U.S. airlines in 2018. Finding Hawaiian Airlines had the best on-time record. Southwest number two. Followed by Allegiant Air, Delta and Spirit. But isn't Hawaiian Maria, always number one because the weather's good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: One of the reasons I have to say, yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks -- Lauren.</p><p>Coming up, we're talking crypto -- Facebook crypto. It is coming. The networking giant formally releasing the highly anticipated details behind the digital exchange at Facebook. I'll talk with Facebook's head of Calibra, David Marcus is here an dhow the company is looking to disrupt the space.</p><p>And then targeting tobacco, Philip Morris International COO will join me in Cannes to talk about the FDA crackdown on e-cigarettes, nicotine and how it could hurt -- nicotine and how it could hurt the industry. We'll get a global outlook from him.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting again. Here's what he just said. \"European markets rose on comments unfair to the U.S. made today by Mario D.\" -- of course he's talking about Mario Draghi where we see the currency there going lower, given the fact that Mario Draghi has added stimulus to the European economy.</p><p>We're talking about stimulus this morning because the Federal Reserve kicked off a two-day meeting. And we will hear from Jay Powell tomorrow.</p><p>Meanwhile, tobacco industry has been growing for years. Philip Morris aiming to get out of the smokable tobacco and moving entirely to smokeless alternatives market. This as analysts at Morgan Stanley say an FDA proposal to limit nicotine could cost the industry $165 billion by 2035.</p><p>Joining me right now is the chief operating officer of Philip Morris International, Jacek Olczak. Jacek -- it's great to have you on the show this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>JACEK OLCZAK, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, PHILIP MORIS INTERNATIONAL: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So tell me about this, in terms of the FDA's move and what kind of an impact it's going to have for Philip Morris.</p><p>OLCZAK: Well, I think -- and the reason to, you know, get the smokers out of the combustible cigarette is that is a good reason. It's a good intervention as long as the consumer has alternatives. So our role is to supply the market with a scientifically verified alternative. In our case the heat not burned (INAUDIBLE) which we have to receive the PMPA (ph) authorization from FDA.</p><p>So I mean let it all (INAUDIBLE). I do believe that if all the forces align-- regulatory, consumer, communication, within 10 years we can fully get rid of smoking country by country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>OLCZAK: We never had the opportunity in front of us so close and so materially in what we can do. I mean if I go to the countries where we started three and-a-half years ago, I mean the progress is tremendous.</p><p>I mean the smokers are looking for alternatives. Obviously the best way for them should be to quit smoking. The unfortunate thing is that people don't quit smoking. We provide them the products which today, you know, are vastly better than a conventional cigarettes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me the difference in terms of health, in terms of the impact on a person's body, cigarettes versus the vapes, like a Juul product, or e-cigarettes.</p><p>OLCZAK: I mean the difference is in the level of satisfaction delivered to the smoker, right. There is the (INAUDIBLE) component. There is the taste components. People smoke cigarette for the taste.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But is it a health risk? Is there a health risk on vapes and e-cigarettes as much as a health risk exists for cigarettes?</p><p>OLCZAK: No, they are not the same, none of the alternative products is risk-free. They do have a potential of being much lower risk to a consumer than continuing smoking. So I think at the end of the day, it's all in line with the (INAUDIBLE) reduction concept. You don't have a perfect product but this product is vastly better than this one.</p><p>And I think actually this whole confusion where many people will say that the e-cigarettes are (INAUDIBLE) product -- they're not risk-free. You're passing the wrong message to consumers because it allows them to stay, forces them to stay in a conventional product which is bd for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, this is why I'm asking you. People need to understand the difference. I don't think people have really explained that very well.</p><p>And then you've got this whole story about regulation. Are you expecting even further regulation of the industry? San Francisco officials for example voting today on whether to ban e-cigarette sales.</p><p>OLCZAK: I don't think it's the right thing to do, frankly speaking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It still needs another yes vote before the law but the legislation has been -- it could make San Francisco the first city to ban e-cigarettes.</p><p>OLCZAK: Ok. I think there was a lot of emotional elements in the discussions. I mean they should go back to the facts. I mean e-cigarettes are a better product than the conventional cigarette. So I don't fully understand why on the one hand we're banning the better product while the sales of the other product is allowed. That doesn't really make sense.</p><p>It's about the solving the problem of smoking. And for a company like Philip Morris International to make the statement, they're willing to go smoke-free, that they are willing to solve the problem of smoking. And I put all my resources, marketing, production, R&amp;D, et cetera to go beyond this whole thing. I would expect that, you know, other people who are truly interested in solving the problem of smoking will go with me.</p><p>And I hear from time to time that there are some interventions which don't really, you know, solve the problem. That's where the people -- you have 40 million smoking Americans. I think they do deserve better treatment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. That's a good point. How have you changed your business as a result of all of this pushback on nicotine?</p><p>OLCZAK: We have decided that this is not additional product to our portfolio. If this product is better than cigarettes, let's get rid of cigarettes and we're preferring -- every year we're making progress. Today we sell $40 billion of our products in 48 markets. We are ready to go to the next market, working for the solutions for the market in general degree (ph) because we have to remember smoking is not just the habit if you like of the rich people. It's also you have people with lower income. We need a solution for those people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course. Real quick, before we go. Where is the growth at Philip Morris coming from in the next five years.</p><p>OLCZAK: From a new product. Entirely from a new product. We essentially stopped investing behind old products.</p><p>I mean this year alone, I mean we've now given a full year we already shut down the three factories manufacturing combustible cigarettes. We just truly want to get rid of smoking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's fascinating that you could shift your business in such a significant way.</p><p>Jacek -- thanks very much for joining us to talk about it.</p><p>OLCZAK: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Jacek Olczak joining us there from Philip Morris International.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook crypto is coming. The networking giant releasing the highly anticipated details behind the digital exchange. I'll be speaking with Facebook's head of Calibra, David Marcus, on how the company is looking to disrupt the space. That's coming up next.</p><p>And then I'm talking this morning with the CMO of the iconic children's toy company Lego on the brand's expansion into theme parks.</p><p>Back in a minute with all of that.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo, with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from France at the 2019 Cannes Lions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us as we come to you live from Cannes this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 18th. Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are higher, Futures pointing toward a higher opening as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting kicks off today and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer testifies before the Senate on China trade and USMCA later this morning.</p><p>Dow Industrials right now up 113 points, one half of one percent, S&amp;P Futures up 13-3/4 and the NASDAQ Futures higher by 62-1/2, almost one percent.</p><p>On top of gains yesterday, even though they were fractional, yesterday markets were up at the close, Dow Industrials up 22, the S&amp;P less than two percent away from its record high with a gain of just two points and the NASDAQ was up 48 points at the close yesterday.</p><p>The momentum continues this morning here in Europe, European markets are up after the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled more stimulus for the Eurozone is on the way. The European markets are up, FT- 100 up 60 points, CAC Quarante in Paris up 75, and the DAX Index in Germany up 143 points, better than one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets are mostly higher, take a look, with the exception of Japan. The NIKKEI was down three-quarters of a percent but the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up one percent.</p><p>U.S. Treasury yields are lower this morning, falling, the 10 year yield hitting a 21-month low as the Fed kicks off its two-day meeting. That yield now at 2.03 percent. Falling for a sixth straight session.</p><p>Apple T.V. getting an upgrade. Find out the latest features being added to enhance the viewing experience.</p><p>And a real life Iron Man, check this out, look at the bulletproof suit that has been built and it can actually fly. Yes, find out who made it. We've got all the details coming up.</p><p>First though, President Trump is just tweeting this morning and here's what he just said. The fake news doesn't report it but Republican enthusiasm is at an all-time high. Look what is going on in Orlando, Florida right now. People have never seen anything like it unless you play a guitar, going to be wild. See you later. The president of course is kicking off his 2020 campaign today in Orlando. He's gearing up for a big crowds this afternoon.</p><p>All that coming up this morning. But first, our top story this half an hour, Facebook's cryptocurrency. The social media giant is sharing plans for Calibra, that's a newly formed subsidiary of Facebook that will allow people to actually participate in the new Libra digital currency. The Libra Network expected to launch a digital currency next year called Libra. Dozens of companies like eBay, Spotify, PayPal and Uber have already signed on as partners for this. And we're going to talk more about this coming up.</p><p>You know, when you look at Bitcoin and the success of Bitcoin, Cheryl Casone, you've got to believe that there's a market for this and when you look at what has taken place in terms of the competitors to Bitcoin, you've got to say that another digital currency further legitimizes this market.</p><p>CASONE: Certainly you're going to get more competition likely. It may not be this year, it may not be next year but it could be maybe 10, 15 years out. Well, digital cryptocurrency has got issues. It's got safety issues. There was a huge theft in one of the Bitcoin exchanges over in Asia just about a month ago. So they've got to be able to -- and I think Facebook is going to have to face this, they're going to have to make sure that they've got everything safely in place so that you don't get that kind of theft and I'm sure they do. They do have this big partnerships that you talked about.</p><p>But again, is it going to be Bitcoin, another cryptocurrency, who knows? But whether you're Goldman Sachs or you're J.P. Morgan, all of the big banks here in New York, on Wall Street, they're looking at this market and even Lloyd Blankfein said, initially he was kind of a doubter as was Jamie Dimon. They're now saying, OK, Bitcoin is the kind of market they want to be a part in. And I think that does legitimize the cryptocurrency.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's really funny. I love the Jamie Dimon story. Because Jamie Dimon initially came out saying no way, we're never going to trade Bitcoin, it's not what we do, we don't -- we're not believers, until his daughter made so much money on it. She bought it and then she looked like a genius and he said, well, wait a minute, let me look at that again.</p><p>You know, this is the first time that we're getting the list of companies that are actually participating, Lindsey. So when you see companies like eBay, Spotify, PayPal, you know, Uber, they've signed onto this partnership and there are others, big companies. That's got to give it legs as well.</p><p>BELL: Yes, I think it definitely gives it legs. It legitimizes it as Cheryl said. I think this is really just when you think about cryptocurrency, this is just the next evolution of it. We're still in very early stages within this asset class. So it's very good to see these companies piling on, joining forces with Facebook.</p><p>Again, like I said earlier, this is going to be a cryptocurrency that's actually backed by government securities. Hopefully making it more stable and reliable option if you're looking to get into the crypto space.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it was really the block chain technology that most people said that they believe in that. Now, Facebook built its own block chain, Cheryl, and it's based on that. But for a long time, people were thinking, I'm not sure about digital currencies but I'm definitely a believer in block chain.</p><p>CASONE: Right, block chain really became the story out of the Bitcoin story to your point. But also, you know, you have to look at these companies and ask yourself, especially these large companies like your eBay, your Spotify, your PayPal, if they would be willing to go into this market. If it wasn't more solid and more safe and I think that that -- this news we got today out of Facebook is telling us that it is.</p><p>You did have a guest in the last hour though, on the show talking about the issue of regulation. You've already got the government going after big technology. Not just the U.S. government, but the Europeans, (AUDIO GAP) more regulation on this market. You know, coming in the future as well as (INAUDIBLE) all these calls to break up big tech and Alphabet and everybody else. I mean, it's a little bit of a -- of a question mark right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and you know, they've been building out this cryptocurrency for over a year. I believe it was the Wall Street Journal which first reported that they were building this out and now today we're getting the confirmation. David Marcus is going to join us shortly to talk more about that. So we'll get back to that when David Marcus joins us.</p><p>Meanwhile, in terms of the broad story, lifting markets this morning, it's got to be about the Fed, ladies, right? I mean, the Federal Reserve is probably not going to -- you know, cut rates today, although there is a portion of Wall Street and investors who think they will. But what's behind this rally here is the fact that it looks like whether it's today or in the next couple of months, the next move from the Fed is probably a cut.</p><p>BELL: Yes, I think the ECB's commentary this morning about their willingness to deploy stimulus if necessary really puts pressure on Jay Powell over the course of their meetings today and tomorrow and especially in the -- in the press conference tomorrow.</p><p>So of course, we're expecting the Fed to signal their willingness to be a little more accommodative if their -- the situation arises where economic data starts getting much weaker than what we have seen. But we don't expect a move at this meeting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a short break. You've got to wonder what a 2.03 percent 10 year yield tells us about the broad economy and whether or not we're going to see a slowdown. We're going to talk with Facebook's David Marcus on cryptocurrency when we come back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. And as promised, joining us right now is the Facebook head of Calibra, he is our special guest from Menlo Park, California, David Marcus. And David, it's great to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID MARCUS, HEAD OF CALIBRA, FACEBOOK: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So the Wall Street Journal has been reporting that you've been working on this digital currency for over a year. Can you tell us about Libra and what you're unveiling this morning?</p><p>MARCUS: Well, we are unveiling our plans for a new type of block chain, one that can actually scale to meets the demands of billions of people that we ultimately want to serve when it launches at some point next year. A new cryptocurrency which unlike other cryptocurrencies is not, you know, volatile. So it's not -- it's not an investment asset. It's designed from the ground-up to be a medium of exchange, a great form of digitally native currency.</p><p>And all of that is actually going to be governed by a non for profit association that is going to be managed by its members and we're starting with 27 other companies, this journey. And hopefully by the time this network goes live, over a hundred different global organizations that will help manage and govern this new network and this new currency.</p><p>And then on the other side of that, which you know, the association is something that will just be one of many governing. We will have a digital wallet called Calibra that will both be a standalone app but also be embedded in WhatsApp and Messenger so that anyone can on-ramp and off-ramp to this new digital currency and pay one another across the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, it's interesting, this network of companies that you've already got on-board. Can you explain to us why Libra is better or might be better than what's on the market already, like for example, Bitcoin?</p><p>MARCUS: Well, I think two differences. And so, first of all, the companies, the reason that we couldn't go alone here is because if you want to build an internet of money or a protocol for value on the existing internet, this is not something that should be controlled by one company. It should be controlled and governed, you know, as a public good, the same way the internet is. So eventually, we'll get there.</p><p>But to start, we had to ensure that this was governed by a number of institutions and global organizations and not by Facebook.</p><p>And then we go to your question on how different it is than Bitcoin, I think, you know, the first thing is Bitcoin today, I see it as an investment assets that's decorrelated from all kind of different investment assets, but it's not a great medium of exchange today because you know, good currency is actually very stable. And Bitcoin is volatile which is -- you know, its feature if you're looking at it from an investment standpoint.</p><p>The other difference is the network on top -- on top of which Libra will run and this block chain is designed from the ground-up to be able to process thousands of transactions per second, eventually, so meeting the demands for potentially billions of people that will end up hopefully one day using this new network and asset.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So David, answer the critics because obviously Facebook has faced plenty of criticism over privacy concerns, privacy breaches, that's the business model, selling people's data to advertising. So is that going to be addressed now that money is involved? How do you -- how do you square the circle on this and get people's trust, given the fact that there's been a breach of trust in the last couple of years?</p><p>MARCUS: Well, I mean, that's a really good question. And obviously something we've thought about for a very long time. So first and foremost, to use Libra, you will not need to use a Facebook product if you don't want to. There will be plenty of wallets offering similar services than, you know, Calibra will offer. So you can choose whatever wallet you want. And by the way, all the wallets will be interoperable with one another because they'll run on top of the same network.</p><p>So, you know, if we want people to trust us with this new service, we'll have to basically deserve their trust and the way that we are doing this is that, you know, we've created this separate entity that is going to be a regulated entity, Calibra, and we heard people loud and clear. They don't want their financial data co-mingled with their social data and they certainly don't want their financial data being used for ad targeting and all these things and so that's what we're doing.</p><p>Basically Facebook Inc. will not have access to financial data that you'll have inside of Calibra. So we're clearly separating things and we've create a lot of competition on this network that we've helped start.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, real quick, is this an effort by Facebook to diversify the business, given the issues on the -- on the privacy breach side?</p><p>MARCUS: Sorry, I couldn't hear at the beginning of your question.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is this your effort to diversify the business, given the fact that you faced criticism over the privacy breaches?</p><p>MARCUS: No. I don't think this --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, you look at some of your early investors, like Roger McNamee, right. He was such a fan and remains a huge investor. But he'll say he's been on this program and said, look, this is the company's business model and there's nowhere to go. I mean, this is what they do. So is this your effort to diversify the revenue stream to broaden out so you're not married to that revenue stream only, selling people's data to advertisers?</p><p>MARCUS: Well, first of all, let me just defend our business model for a second because I think it's a great business model, actually, and I don't think that the business model is the issue here. First of all, we're not selling data to advertisers and the ability for us to actually run ads on the platform is the way we offer the service for free to billions of people around the world. This is the way that 90 million small businesses are actually growing their businesses because they have an ability to reach new customers and it powers the economy of small businesses around the world.</p><p>So the business model at Facebook is not the issue. I think that there are number of things that we should have done better over the past few years but you've seen that we've invested and we're continuing to invest a great deal to improve with those things. And now with this new network, we're even going a step further which is basically relinquishing a lot of our governance and a lot of our influence over this network that we've helped create to create a level playing field and basically you know, compete with others.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, well, it certainly is a hot spot. David, great to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>MARCUS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: David Marcus joining us at Facebook.</p><p>Coming up, we're looking at Lego. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Lego, one of the most beloved toy brands ever for decades, kids and adults enjoying those iconic plastic building blocks. And increasing market shares of video games become more and more popular.</p><p>Joining me right now is the chief marketing officer of Lego Global, Julia Goldin. Julia, it's great to have you on the show this morning.</p><p>JULIA GOLDIN, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, LEGO GLOBAL: Thank you. Excited to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. What has been the impact of Lego -- to Lego, rather, when you see things like gaming and other entertainment really rising in popularity as well? Have you seen an impact?</p><p>GOLDIN: Well, kids change all the time. And of course the world has changed a lot and what we see is that kids very much enjoy what they called fluid play. Because we do a lot of insights and investigations with kids, we observe them, we talk to them. And what they like is switching between the different worlds. So that has created a lot of opportunity for them to engage with them in different ways.</p><p>Kids have always loved digital games from Lego. That has already been in existence for a long time. But what we're doing now is also connecting the physical experience with the digital experience. For example, you know, we have a new theme that's coming out this year, just in the couple of months called Hidden Side. And that's where kids are going to be able to build physically and then enjoy n augmented reality experience around their game -- around the set that they build which brings the world to life. So it has created a lot of opportunity for us to tap into new ways in which kids play and also new ways of engaging with them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you've got to sell this in terms of marketing. Tell us how your marketing has changed to engage new audiences.</p><p>GOLDIN: Well, marketing has definitely gone through a big revolution and evolution over the last few years because of the invention of digital and formation of digital platforms. But when it comes to engaging with kids, we tend to be super audience focused. Meaning that we really try to understand what they're into, what passions they have. But we also want to make sure that we engage with them in a very safe way in terms of digital.</p><p>So marketing model has definitely evolved. Whereas before it was much more focused on traditional media. Now, of course we engage a lot more in the digital space. But we also have other ways of engaging, for example, we've launched our own digital platform called Lego Life, it's a completely safe digital platform for kids and they really love it.</p><p>We also have Lego YouTube, we have Lego T.V. So there's a lot of different up ways in which we are now delivering content to them and engaging them on their favorite themes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is so fantastic. I love your business card. It is a little Lego with your name and number on the back. It's just so fascinating. You're still seeing growth continuing to grow at Lego?</p><p>GOLDIN: Absolutely. Well, we have a very strong purpose which is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow. So for us, every child is that opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Julia, thank you so much. Congratulations. Julia Goldin from Lego. We'll be right back.</p><p>GOLDIN: Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019061802cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCD-S8S1-DXH2-627N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7153\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 18, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The US-based internet colossus maintained it has been cooperating with a European Commission antitrust investigation and will continue to do so, but that the wording of commission requests casts a net so wide it will haul in Facebook employees' private messages and more.   The leading social network expects to give the commission hundreds of thousands of documents, according to Facebook associate general counsel for competition Tim Lamb \"The exceptionally broad nature of the commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission's investigations,\" Lamb said in response to an AFP inquiry.   Those documents include \"highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information; personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees.\" Facebook thinks such requests should be reviewed by EU courts, according to Lamb, and is asking the court to weigh in on broad search terms such as \"applause\" or \"for free\" that could easily be found in personal email messages or other exchanges way beyond the scope of antitrust matters.        Regulatory probes can involve requests for messages or documents bearing certain words or phrases, with those seeking information inclined to craft wide nets and those being queried wanting them narrowly targeted.   A highly anticipated US antitrust hearing , including top executives of four Big Tech firms, originally set for Monday was postponed to Wednesday.   The House Judiciary Committee hearing titled \"Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple , Facebook , and Google \" will feature the chief executives of all four companies: Tim Cook of Apple , Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet.   The hearing comes amid rising concerns over Big Tech dominance, which has become even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic and coincides with investigations at the Federal and state levels into the online giants.   The session was postponed due to the memorial service for the late representative and civil rights leader John Lewis, who will lie in state in the US Capitol until Tuesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42706938124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G1-1981-JCSC-J2JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>UrduPoint.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The US-based internet colossus maintained it has been cooperating with a European Commission antitrust investigation and will continue to do so, but that the wording of commission requests casts a net so wide it will haul in Facebook employees' private messages and more.  The leading social network expects to give the commission hundreds of thousands of documents, according to Facebook associate general counsel for competition Tim Lamb.  \"The exceptionally broad nature of the commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission's investigations,\" Lamb said in response to an AFP inquiry.  Those documents include \"highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information; personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees.\"  Facebook thinks such requests should be reviewed by EU courts, according to Lamb, and is asking the court to weigh in on broad search terms such as \"applause\" or \"for free\" that could easily be found in personal email messages or other exchanges way beyond the scope of antitrust matters.  Regulatory probes can involve requests for messages or documents bearing certain words or phrases, with those seeking information inclined to craft wide nets and those being queried wanting them narrowly targeted.

The US-based internet colossus maintained it has been cooperating with a European Commission antitrust investigation and will continue to do so, but that the wording of commission requests casts a net so wide it will haul in Facebook employees' private messages and more.    The leading social network expects to give the commission hundreds of thousands of documents, according to Facebook associate general counsel for competition Tim Lamb    \"The exceptionally broad nature of the commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission's investigations,\" Lamb said in response to an AFP inquiry.    Those documents include \"highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information; personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees.\"    Facebook thinks such requests should be reviewed by EU courts, according to Lamb, and is asking the court to weigh in on broad search terms such as \"applause\" or \"for free\" that could easily be found in personal email messages or other exchanges way beyond the scope of antitrust matters.    Regulatory probes can involve requests for messages or documents bearing certain words or phrases, with those seeking information inclined to craft wide nets and those being queried wanting them narrowly targeted.    A highly anticipated US antitrust hearing, including top executives of four Big Tech firms, was originally set for Monday but has been postponed.    A notice filed by the House Judiciary Committee set no new date for the hearing titled \"Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.\"    The hearing would have conflicted with the memorial service for the late representative and civil rights leader John Lewis, who will lie in state in the US Capitol until Tuesday.    The antitrust hearing was called amid rising concerns over Big Tech dominance, which has become even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic and coincides with investigations at the federal and state levels into the online giants.     Chief executives Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet had agreed to participate in the session.     \u00a9 Agence France-Presse</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42699553024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FV-5HR1-F07F-848F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ABS-CBN News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00052GB</classCode><className>AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Those documents include \"highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information; personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees.\"    Facebook thinks such requests should be reviewed by EU courts, according to Lamb, and is asking the court to weigh in on broad search terms such as \"applause\" or \"for free\" that could easily be found in personal email messages or other exchanges way beyond the scope of antitrust matters.    Regulatory probes can involve requests for messages or documents bearing certain words or phrases, with those seeking information inclined to craft wide nets and those being queried wanting them narrowly targeted.

The US-based internet colossus maintained it has been cooperating with a European Commission antitrust investigation and will continue to do so, but that the wording of commission requests casts a net so wide it will haul in Facebook employees\u2019 private messages and more.    The leading social network expects to give the commission hundreds of thousands of documents, according to Facebook associate general counsel for competition Tim Lamb.    \u201cThe exceptionally broad nature of the commission\u2019s requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission\u2019s investigations,\u201d Lamb said in response to an AFP inquiry.    Those documents include \u201chighly sensitive personal information such as employees\u2019 medical information; personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees.\u201d    Facebook thinks such requests should be reviewed by EU courts, according to Lamb, and is asking the court to weigh in on broad search terms such as \u201capplause\u201d or \u201cfor free\u201d that could easily be found in personal email messages or other exchanges way beyond the scope of antitrust matters.    Regulatory probes can involve requests for messages or documents bearing certain words or phrases, with those seeking information inclined to craft wide nets and those being queried wanting them narrowly targeted.    A highly anticipated US antitrust hearing, including top executives of four Big Tech firms, originally set for yesterday was postponed to tomorrow.    The House Judiciary Committee hearing titled \u201cExamining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google\u201d will feature the chief executives of all four companies: Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet.    The hearing comes amid rising concerns over Big Tech dominance, which has become even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic and coincides with investigations at the federal and state levels into the online giants.    The session was postponed due to the memorial service for the late representative and civil rights leader John Lewis, who will lie in state in the US Capitol until today. \u2014 AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42704778977</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G1-1951-F07F-82R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"498\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Malay Mail</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
