The article said that Simington 'played a significant role in the agency's social media regulation agenda.' Benton Institute suggested that, if confirmed, 'the nomination would represent a significant blow to Republicans who favor a light-touch approach to telecom policy.'Benton Institute added that 'his nomination would be a victory for Republicans who want to see the FCC take a larger role in regulating social networks.' It also noted that 'In Aug, President Donald Trump abruptly withdrew Commissioner O'Rielly's nomination after O'Rielly gave a speech opposing making changes to Section 230.'The Verge[2] echoed this same idea that Simington played a critical role in 'drafting a petition required under the Trump administration's social media executive order issued over the summer.'Indeed, the Trump administration called on the FCC to clarify Section 230[3] of the Communications Decency Act after years of alleged liberal bias among Big Tech companies[4]. The FCC announced a call for public comment for 45 days[5] regarding the Trump administration's petition on August 3.Liberal tech outlet The Verge acknowledged that Simington's nomination would be a game-changer for Big Tech: 'If Simington's nomination is approved in the Senate, the FCC would have two Republican commissioners likely in favor of voting to approve the administration's social media order. </p><p>Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr penned an op-ed in Newsweek[6] last month arguing that the FCC should require social media platforms to submit transparency reports similar to what internet service providers already do.'Conservatives are under attack. Contact the FCC at 1-888-225-5322 or tweet at the official @FCC Twitter account[7] and demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on 'hate speech' and equal footing for conservatives.

The article said that Simington 'played a significant role in the agency's social media regulation agenda.' Benton Institute suggested that, if confirmed, 'the nomination would represent a significant blow to Republicans who favor a light-touch approach to telecom policy.'Benton Institute added that 'his nomination would be a victory for Republicans who want to see the FCC take a larger role in regulating social networks.' It also noted that 'In Aug, President Donald Trump abruptly withdrew Commissioner O'Rielly's nomination after O'Rielly gave a speech opposing making changes to Section 230.'The Verge[2] echoed this same idea that Simington played a critical role in 'drafting a petition required under the Trump administration's social media executive order issued over the summer.'Indeed, the Trump administration called on the FCC to clarify Section 230[3] of the Communications Decency Act after years of alleged liberal bias among Big Tech companies[4]. The FCC announced a call for public comment for 45 days[5] regarding the Trump administration's petition on August 3.Liberal tech outlet The Verge acknowledged that Simington's nomination would be a game-changer for Big Tech: 'If Simington's nomination is approved in the Senate, the FCC would have two Republican commissioners likely in favor of voting to approve the administration's social media order. </p><p>Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr penned an op-ed in Newsweek[6] last month arguing that the FCC should require social media platforms to submit transparency reports similar to what internet service providers already do.'Conservatives are under attack. Contact the FCC at 1-888-225-5322 or tweet at the official @FCC Twitter account[7] and demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on 'hate speech' and equal footing for conservatives.

President Donald Trump may nominate National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) senior adviser Nathan Simington for the role of FCC Commissioner, Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society reported . The article said that Simington \u201cplayed a significant role in the agency\u2019s social media regulation agenda.\u201d Benton Institute suggested that, if confirmed, \u201cthe nomination would represent a significant blow to Republicans who favor a light-touch approach to telecom policy.\u201d    Benton Institute added that \u201chis nomination would be a victory for Republicans who want to see the FCC take a larger role in regulating social networks.\u201d It also noted that \u201cIn Aug, President Donald Trump abruptly withdrew Commissioner O\u2019Rielly\u2019s nomination after O'Rielly gave a speech opposing making changes to Section 230.\u201d    The Verge echoed this same idea that Simington played a critical role in \u201cdrafting a petition required under the Trump administration\u2019s social media executive order issued over the summer.\u201d    Indeed, the Trump administration called on the FCC to clarify Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act after years of alleged liberal bias among Big Tech companies . The FCC announced a call for public comment for 45 days regarding the Trump administration\u2019s petition on August 3.    Liberal tech outlet The Verge acknowledged that Simington\u2019s nomination would be a game-changer for Big Tech:     \u201cIf Simington\u2019s nomination is approved in the Senate, the FCC would have two Republican commissioners likely in favor of voting to approve the administration\u2019s social media order. Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr penned an op-ed in Newsweek  last month arguing that the FCC should require social media platforms to submit transparency reports similar to what internet service providers already do.\u201d   Conservatives are under attack. Contact the FCC at 1-888-225-5322  or tweet at the official @FCC Twitter account and demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on \u201chate speech\u201d and equal footing for conservatives.

The scandal was exposed in part after Utah businessman Jeremy Johnson, who had close ties to Swallow and his predecessor, Mark Shurtleff, was slapped with federal criminal charges that grew out of the FTC's investigation into his online-marketing company's business practices.</p><p>A spokesman for Reyes would neither confirm nor deny the report.</p><p>\"At this time, Sean has not applied for the FTC job, he has not submitted his resume for the FTC job, nor has he been interviewed for the FTC job,\" Reyes' political director Alan Crooks said. \"But the Politico story suggests there are some heavy rumors going around in D.C.\"</p><p>Reyes was at Trump Tower in New York on election night, Nov. 8, 2016. He talked about the experience of being with the Trump family the next day on KNRS Radio's Rod Arquette show and said he'd been asked by many if he wanted, or was angling for, a job in the new administration.</p><p>\"Absolutely not. I love this job,\" Reyes told Arquette. \"It's the greatest job I've ever had being the AG for the state of Utah. I'm passionate about it and I will commit that I want to stay here.\"</p><p>Reyes said there was nothing that would lure him way from Utah, but that if he could see a way for Utah to contribute or help Trump in some way, for example aiding in choosing Supreme Court nominees, he would be \"excited to serve in that capacity.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jdobner@sltrib.com\">jdobner@sltrib.com</email></p><p>@jenniferdobner</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-30733815</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALTLAKMNG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MNG-3R01-DYT4-V298-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"374\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 17, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Oh my god!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: A librarian from Chicago takes down \"Jeopardy\" champ James Holzhauer, ending his $2.4 million run.</p><p>Good morning, and welcome to EARLY START, everyone. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs. It was a strange final game for Jeopardy James. Talk about that shortly.</p><p>I'm Dave Briggs. Tuesday, June 4th, 4:00 in the East. It is 9:00 a.m. in London. And that's where we begin on game two of President Trump's three-day visit to the U.K.</p><p>Over in the next two hours, he and British Prime Minister Theresa May will be spending a lot of time together, first up on the schedule, a business round table at St. James palace. Then the president and prime minister hosts a breakfast attended by the duke of York and prominent U.S. and British business leaders. Talks follow later in the day and it is anyone's guess how this will all go. The two leaders already had a rocky relationship before the president publicly second guessed the prime minister this week on her Brexit strategy.</p><p>Let's go live to London and bring in CNN's Nic Robertson.</p><p>Could be an interesting day there, Nic. Good morning. What's in store? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Good morning.</p><p>Well, right now, Theresa May, P Trump sitting down with five CEO -- or ten CEOs, five from leading British companies, five from leading U.S. companies. You have Barclays Bank. You have GlaxoSmithKline. You have BAE Systems. You have J.P. Morgan to name a few of the companies.</p><p>And what Theresa May is likely to say is, look, we already do a lot of business with the United States, trade between the two countries is usually important. British companies overall employ more than a million Americans. She'll point to this roundtable and say, look at this round table here, these British businesses here employ in the United States and Britain about 176,000 people. BAE systems and employ 60,000 people in the United States, 40 percent of their sales in the United States.</p><p>She is going to amplify that message that trade between the two countries is already very good, but this round table session is really a photo opportunity, if you like, but a way for people to sort of get a sense of the scale of that relationship, which is going to say we can do better than a future outside of the European Union, a free trade agreement with the United States, these companies can do more business together. So, that's going to be the narrative that she has for this meeting this morning -- Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: So from pomp and circumstance yesterday to protests today, what do you expect on that front?</p><p>ROBERTSON: Yes, a couple of hours, big protests getting underway down the street here at Trafalgar Square. It's expected to match past the end of downing street sometime after that. Not clear on the numbers but some big speakers, a leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, no friend of President Trump, he will be there to speak to the people who are gathered. Undoubtedly when they pass here, they will try to do it when President Trump, and Theresa May are meeting together, try to make as much noise as possible.</p><p>This is a very secure street. None of the protesters are going to get within a rock's throw, if you like, of where President Trump will be. So, the environment he'll be in will be a very secure environment. They'll be trying to just make themselves heard so he gets an idea there are people in this city who don't care for his policies, don't care for the way he does business.</p><p>BRIGGS: A 21 percent approval there in the U.K.</p><p>Nic Robertson, live for us in London this morning, thank you.</p><p>The president and first lady attended a state banquet hosted by the queen at Buckingham Palace. The president walking with the queen as Melania Trump chatted with Prince Charles. The queen and Mr. Trump celebrated the relationship between the U.S. and Britain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) [04:05:02] DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: She has embodied the spirit of dignity, spirit and patriotism that beats proudly in every British heart. On behalf of all Americans, I offer a toast to the eternal friendship of our people, the eternal friendship of our people, the vitality of our nations, and to the long cherished and truly remarkable reign of her majesty, the queen.</p><p>QUEEN ELIZABETH II, UNITED KINGDOM: Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you all to rise and drink a toast to President and Mrs. Trump to the continued friendship between our two nations and to the health, prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Prior to that event, the first couple had tea with Charles and Camila earlier in the day. They rolled out the red carpet for president Trump, receiving him with the royal troops salute.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. But back home, congressional Republicans may be planning a revolt to block tariffs on Mexico, and according to \"The Washington Post,\" they could vote to block billions of dollars in border wall funding announced by the president in February when he declared a national emergency.</p><p>Senate Majority Whip John Thune tells the post we have a lot of members concerned about where this is headed. Congress is going to want to be heard from trying to limit Trump's tariff authority.</p><p>The president is threatening to impose a 5 percent tariff on Mexican imports beginning next week, with that rate rising incrementally to 25 percent by October 1st.</p><p>BRIGGS: A setback for Democrats in their bid to stop President Trump from building a border wall. A federal judge ruling the president can transfer funds from appropriate accounts to pay for construction. The judge also says the House lacks standing to challenge the president and he concludes the court should get involved in the fight between the president and Congress.</p><p>The ruling is not expected to impact other lawsuits by House Democrats in various states to block border wall protection.</p><p>ROMANS: White House lawmakers are launching a top-to-bottom antitrust probe of big tech with Google, Amazon, Facebook as some of the targets.</p><p>Rhode Island Democrat Representative David Cicilline is leading the investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): This is a broad investigation of the whole marketplace. So, it involved a whole range of companies. But it's really to look at competition in the digital marketplace, to look at anti-competitive behavior and determine whether our existing antitrust statutes are working, when whether they need to be modernized and updated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: A new era we're entering in tech after scandal after scandal for the tech industry. Critics have called for tough new regulations. They have demanded some of the companies be broken up. The investigation comes as the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission recently agreed to divide oversight of the tech industry.</p><p>Congressman Cicilline says this is the first time Congress has launched a significant antitrust investigation in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CICILLINE: Frankly, you know, I don't have a lot of confidence that this administration has been particularly aggressive in their antitrust enforcement. In fact, they very often have co out on the side of monopolists and big mergers. So, I think, again, they have a responsibility in particular, enforcement actions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Officials have notified Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook of this coming investigation. Amazon and Google declined to comment. Apple and Facebook did not immediately respond to CNN for a request for comment.</p><p>BRIGGS: The House passing a $19.1 billion disaster aid package sending it to the president for his signature. The Senate passed -- the bill rather passed the Senate last week. President Trump has said he supports it. The legislation will speed relief funds to communities hard hit by tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other disaster. The bill also includes money for Puerto Rico which is still rebuilding after Hurricane Maria.</p><p>ROMANS: The long reign of \"Jeopardy\" champ James Holzhauer is over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TREBEK: So, Emma, it's up to you. If you came up with the correct response, you're going to be the new \"Jeopardy\" champion. Did you? You did. What did you wager? Oh, god, $20,000. What a payday? $46,801. What a game?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: That's Emma. She's a librarian for Chicago dethroning the champ. Holzhauer's remarkable run ended after 32 straight wins. He was just shy of $60,000 away from Ken Jennings all-time record for \"Jeopardy\" earnings.</p><p>But don't shed any tears for this professional sports gambler from Las Vegas. He won a total of $2.4 million during his \"Jeopardy\" reign.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. So, it was interesting. He gave her a high five after the loss, which is good. ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: But he only wagered $13,900 on his final \"Jeopardy\" answer, counting on her to lose, but go big or go home.</p><p>[04:10:00] That's what he's done all along. It was a strange strategy.</p><p>ROMANS: All morning, Dave has been second-guessing James Holzhauer.</p><p>BRIGGS: Second-guessing or suggesting --</p><p>ROMANS: Oh, I don't know, I don't know what you're suggesting.</p><p>BRIGGS: Maybe he's ready to go home. Not sure.</p><p>People around the world are publicly marking 30 years since the Tiananmen Square massacre, but not in China. We're live in Beijing with what they're hearing there, next.</p><p>ROMANS: You know, remarkable, 30 years ago today, the world witnessed a massacre in Tiananmen Square.</p><p>[04:15:05] Hundreds of people killed in Beijing as the People's Liberation Army cracked down on pro-democracy protesters. That image there really, I think, captures what happened there that day. The people against a totalitarian regime.</p><p>Events will be held and speeches will be made around the world today, but, of course, not in China. Any coverage of discussion of the event will be tightly censored there.</p><p>I want to go live to Beijing and bring in CNN's Matt Rivers.</p><p>This is an event that the Chinese government doesn't want to talk about, almost won't admit and we don't even know how many people were killed on that day 30 years ago, people who just want human rights and democracy.</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Christine. And it's not just that China's government doesn't want to talk about it, they will actively try and stop anyone in China from talking about it.</p><p>So start with the domestic population, let's say you go on a Chinese search engine, on Chinese Internet, you type in Tiananmen Square. Nothing will come up about the massacre, it's censored.</p><p>On social media platforms here, any protest mentions are censored. State media will report nothing about this today and that is because China's government is terrified of talking about what happened in 1989. They don't want to talk about that, because it makes their party, the communist party, look more illegitimate, and they want to stay in power more than anything else. And it's not just what they do in state media. It's also what they do to Western media. So, CNN.com right now is blocked in China because we're talking about Tiananmen Square. The TV signal right now in China of CNN is cut.</p><p>And earlier today when we were doing live shots out on the street in an area where a lot of the killings happened, we were harassed by police. We were told we couldn't be there because it was unsafe due to traffic conditions, which was a boldfaced lie. They didn't want us on the street talking about this.</p><p>And all of this leads to governments around the world criticizing the government like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. In a statement today, he said, in part, China's one party state tolerates no decent and abuses human rights wherever it serves its interests. China, of course, countered saying human rights have never been better than right now here in China.</p><p>Christine, I have lived here for almost four years now, and I can tell you that human rights not a big thing for the Chinese government.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>RIVERS: It hasn't been 30 years ago, and doesn't appear to be a big right now.</p><p>ROMANS: It's about social cohesion, and social cohesion means keeping people from having those human rights to state or a government, or to question what the government is doing. I think that statement from Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state is remarkable and the smack back from the Chinese government is as well.</p><p>I'm going to tweet out both of those statements so that people can freely choose both sides of that story.</p><p>Matt Rivers, we really appreciate all the hard work you do there, we know it can be under difficult conditions. Thank you, sir.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>OK. Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten will remain behind bars even though a parole board has set her free. California Governor Gavin Newsom overruling the parole board, marking the third time a governor has blocked her release. The 69-year-old Van Houten was convicted of two 1969 murders and conspiracy to kill five others. Governor Newsom said she would pose an unreasonable danger to society if she was allowed to go free.</p><p>ROMANS: Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg separating himself from his Democratic rivals. He says he would not, not have pressured Senator Al Franken to resign in 2017 following allegations of sexual misconduct.</p><p>Here's what he said at an MSNBC town hall Monday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the way that we basically held him to a higher standard than the GOP does their people has been used against us. I would not have applied that pressure at that time before we knew more.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: His remarks drawing a strong response from fellow candidate Kirsten Gillibrand who was the first to call for Franken's resignation in 2017.</p><p>She says in a statement: Eight credible allegation of sexual harassment, two since he was elected senator, and one from a congressional staffer. That is not too high a standard, regardless of how the Republican Party handles its behavior and worse. Yes, it was Senator Franken's decision alone to leave the Senate, a path he ultimately chose, but for many senators, including myself and others in this primary field, that was not too high of a bar to raise our voice and make clear we value women.</p><p>A lot of women are talking about this and cautioning against lowering the bar because of --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Because of the commander-in-chief essentially instead of keeping the bar high, and understanding that there's, you know, behavior that won't be tolerated.</p><p>BRIGGS: Many Democrats agree with Buttigieg, but why pick that to separate yourself in a crowded field? Seems like a strange choice.</p><p>Ahead, Miley Cyrus fan crosses the line. The story behind this video, next.</p><p>[04:24:48] BRIGGS: A notorious YouTube prankster sentenced to prison in Spain for a video that drew outrage on social media. Kanghua Ren known to followers as ReSet filmed himself offering a homeless man in Barcelona an Oreo cookie that he filled with toothpaste.</p><p>[04:25:04] A Spanish court gave Ren a 15-month sentence and ordered him to pay $22,000 in compensation to the victim. He is unlikely to serve time behind bars. Those Spanish law typically allows sentences under two years for first time offenders and nonviolent crimes to be suspended.</p><p>ROMANS: What people do for clicks or views is just beyond me.</p><p>All right. A Miley Cyrus fan getting too close for comfort during the singer's visit to Barcelona this past weekend.</p><p>A video shows the fan grabbing Cyrus and trying to kiss her as she was leaving her hotel along with her husband, the actor Liam Hemsworth. Cyrus security guard quickly jumped into action to get her away, but she was said to be unsettled by the incident but is doing fine now. Cyrus was in Barcelona to perform at the sound festival and promote her new album which dropped the same day.</p><p>BRIGGS: The Stanley Cup Final, a best of three series.

The series goes back to Boston for game five on Thursday night.</p><p>\"Mad Men\" Actor Jon Hamm fired up this crowd, complete with a solid playoff period last night in St. Louis.</p><p>ROMANS: All right.

He's on the wrong battlefield, writes Bruce Wolpe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The day after Twitter had the temerity to fact-check Donald Trump, who has been found to lie and mislead over 18,000 times in the more than 1200 days he has held office, the President was in a Tweet snit: \"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter's calling out of Trump's charges that postal voting is fraudulent - he believes it helps only Democrats - followed his vicious trolling of MSNBC host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough, all but alleging he murdered one of his aides. It is a wholly false, despicable, filthy charge, and Trump has utterly resisted recanting the slander, and prefers to keep it alive: \"It's certainly a very suspicious situation. Very sad, very sad and very suspicious.\"</p><p>What to do with a President who lies continuously from a bully pulpit with over 80 million followers?</p><p>Under US law, Twitter and social media platforms fit somewhere between traditional publishers and broadcasters - which have full control over access to their platforms and the content they present on those media - and public utilities, or common carriers, which are pipes along which anyone can travel with no control by the owner of the content of the flow. If it's electricity or telephony or data bits, the medium carries the message.</p><p>Finding the balance in setting and enforcing content standards between digital platforms, with their unlimited capacity and unlimited access by anyone who wants it, is this century's tech governance issue. Twitter is not legally liable for what appears on its website - the posters of content are. Twitter does have standards against abusive bullying, and Trump's critics want the company to apply it and delete his account - notwithstanding that he is the President. But it is precisely because a president is unique - there is no other - the company has decided it is in the public interest to let the man rip, and let the people decide and hold him to account.</p><p>But on the issue of facts and truth, Twitter has now taken a harder line, and is cautioning Trump posts that are not within factual bounds - provoking his rage. Twitter went further with a warning Trump violated platform standards and masked a tweet on the violence in Minneapolis and the urgency of the National Guard to restore order. Trump wrote: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"</p><p>Can Trump retaliate further? Speech beyond obscenity, fraud, defamation, incitement to lawless activity is protected by the First Amendment and beyond Trump's reach. This is especially true for any attempt by the US government to censor Twitter's platform, or block it - as is done in China.</p><p>Trump can punish certain players. Amazon owns The Washington Post, a publisher Trump loathes. Trump has targeted Amazon's taxes and Postal Service shipping rates. Trump is after Comcast, owner of NBC. His Justice Department brought AT&amp;T, owner of CNN, to court. Trump's railing against media companies as the \"enemy of the people\" is reminiscent of President Nixon seeking to have The Washington Post stripped of its TV licenses during the paper's heroic reporting of Watergate. Nixon resigned in disgrace for his abuses of power. Trump values his Twitter account more than any other soap box - including Fox News. His 80 million followers dwarf the 4.5 million who watch Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson - and Trump has complete control of his message, even if Twitter adds a fact check.</p><p>The executive order Trump has signed seeks to treat internet platforms as publishers, like The Sun-Herald. But that would not solve his problem - because his tweets would still be subject to editorial accuracy by the companies.</p><p>What Trump can do to Big Tech to bring the companies to heel is to break them up. And in the antitrust arena Facebook, Google and Amazon are very vulnerable on substantive grounds. Investigations of their market and anti-competitive power are under way in Congress, at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, and in several US states. These investigations parallel the exceptional work done by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in a landmark report on digital platforms and how these companies are harming media and advertising markets. Politically - and this is crucial - Republicans hate Big Tech because of their perceived \"liberal\" bias, and Democrats are after them because of their immense size and market power.</p><p>Silicon Valley's greed and excesses have brought Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren together, and it is resonating across Washington. Quite a feat.</p><p>The executive order Trump signed will become a pinata in the courts.

A revealing \"New York Times\" report on President Trump's family taxes suggests he's not the self-made millionaire he claims.</p><p>ROMANS: A rising star in the Democratic Party pulls out of a mayoral race citing post-traumatic stress from his military service.</p><p>BRIGGS: Some of the highest rain totals ever for Phoenix as a tropical depression rolls through the desert.</p><p>ROMANS: And an instant classic. It took 13 innings, but the Rockies are heading to Milwaukee. The Cubs are heading home.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: And I'm bloodshot eyes Dave Briggs. It was a four hour and 55-minute game.</p><p>Good morning, everyone.</p><p>As soon as today, the FBI may deliver a report on Brett Kavanaugh to the White House and Capitol Hill. That news coming as sources tell CNN the bureau is expanding its inquiry into sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee. Two sources say the FBI is focusing on other high school friends of Kavanaugh. He listed them as attending a July 1st, 1982, party on a calendar he provided to the Judiciary Committee. It's not clear that the additional interviews will prolong the investigation. ROMANS: Kavanaugh has vehemently denied allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her at a high school party. She has also said she does not remember some of the details. The president seized on that admission at a rally last night, going further than ever in attacking Kavanaugh's accuser.</p><p>Senior White House correspondent Jeff Zeleny was there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Christine and Dave, President Trump in South Haven, Mississippi, on Tuesday night for a campaign rally, the second campaign rally in as many days. And, of course, we're five weeks before the critical midterm elections.</p><p>The president talking about Judge Kavanaugh, the brutal confirmation process. But he did something that he has not yet done during the course of all of this -- he mocked Christine Blasey Ford, the California research psychologist who accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her some 36 years ago. This is what he said --</p><p>TRUMP: I had one beer. Well, do you think -- nope. It was one beer. Oh, good.</p><p>How did you get home? I don't remember. How did you get there? I don't remember.</p><p>Where is the place? I don't remember. How many years ago was it? I don't know.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What neighborhood was it in? I don't know. Where's the house? I don't know.</p><p>Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know. But I had one beer, that's the only thing I remember.</p><p>ZELENY: Now, that comment was met with laughter and applause from the audience of loyal Trump supporters. The president went on to essentially warn mothers in this crowd that their sons and husbands could also be falsely accused.</p><p>One thing not said at all was any mention about women who have come forward to make credible allegations about sexual assault or misconduct, the force of the #metoo movement.</p><p>Clearly, the president believes that this is a rallying point. Some five weeks before the midterm elections. He believes it's unifying Republicans.</p><p>The open question, though, what it's doing to independent voters and Democrats who are so inspired and infuriated by this same movement?</p><p>Dave and Christine?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: Jeff Zeleny, thanks for that.</p><p>Christine Blasey Ford's lawyer outraged by the president's comments, Michael Bromwich, accusing Mr. Trump of a, quote, vicious, vile, and soulless attack on his client. He went on to call the president a profile in cowardice.</p><p>BRIGGS: In the 1983 letter written by Kavanaugh and obtained by \"The New York Times,\" the future judge describes himself and his friends as, quote, loud, obnoxious drunks with prolific pukers. Not exactly the image Kavanaugh tried to project in his Senate testimony.</p><p>ROMANS: Of note, Kavanaugh signed the letter \"Bart.\" You may remember a book written by Kavanaugh's former classmate, Mark Judge, features a character named Bart O'Kavanaugh. The nominee refused to answer last week when Senator Patrick Leahy asked him if he was Bart O'Kavanaugh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), VERMONT: Are you the Bart Kavanaugh that he's referring to?</p><p>[04:35:01] Yes or no? That's it.</p><p>JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: You'd have to ask him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: So how does all this affect Kavanaugh's confirmation vote? Well, Senators Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski say they are waiting to see what the FBI reports before making up their minds. But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insists the FBI report will not be used as another reason to delay a vote which he claims will take place this week.</p><p>Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wants an FBI briefing for all senators before a vote is scheduled. For now, the only people who can read the FBI file are the 100 senators and a handful of staff, although some members are pushing for some or all of the FBI report to be released to the public.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. A blockbuster \"New York Times\" investigation says Donald Trump helped his parents evade taxes for years, quote, including instances of outright fraud, end quote. Now, the 14,000- word story takes up the entire front page above the fold in \"The New York Times.\" It jumps to several full pages inside.</p><p>The reporting wrecks Trump's carefully built image as a self-made man, and it may be at least one reason he's not released his personal tax returns. This months' long investigation by the \"Times\" draws on more than 100,000 pages of financial documents, some public, some confidential, including 200 Trump family tax returns.</p><p>BRIGGS: Some of \"The Times'\" key findings starting at age 3, Donald Trump received at least $413 million from his father's real estate empire, adjusted for inflation. That is a far cry from the $1 million that he claims his father gave him when he started out. \"The Times\" says the president and his siblings helped his parents build their wealth by hiding millions in gifts in a sham corporation. \"The Times\" also reviewed records showing the president helped formulate a strategy to cut his parents' tax bill by systematically undervaluing their real estate holdings.</p><p>ROMANS: The New York state tax authority say they are reviewing the allegations. A lawyer for the president called \"The Times\" story 100 percent false and defamatory, threatened a possible lawsuit. The White House meantime said in a statement this: Many decades ago, the IRS reviewed and signed off on those transactions. \"The Times\" notes that the statute of limitations on possible wrongdoing, if found, has long since expired.</p><p>BRIGGS: Law enforcement officials scrutinizing a letter addressed to President Trump that contained a substance suspected to be the deadly poison ricin. They say it appears to be connected to similar envelopes delivered to the Pentagon Monday. The envelope addressed to the president was not received at the White House and did not enter the building. All mail received at the Pentagon screening facility Monday is now under quarantine. A spokesman says it poses no threat to Pentagon personnel.</p><p>ROMANS: Be prepared to receive a presidential alert on your cell phone today. The government is conducting its first test of a new designed to push an emergency message to nearly all cell phones in the U.S. It will only be used in cases of public peril like a coordinated attack on major cities.</p><p>The alert will be sent starting at 2:18 Eastern Time this afternoon. It will look and sound like other emergency notifications such as Amber and severe weather alerts. One more detail, you cannot opt out. This test was originally scheduled for mid-September but was postponed because FEMA was responding to Hurricane Florence.</p><p>BRIGGS: A rising star in the Democratic Party is ending his campaign for Kansas City mayor to seek treatment for post traumatic stress disorder. Jason Kander served as an army intelligence officer in Afghanistan. He returned home 11 years ago.</p><p>He says he appreciates all the support he's received but says, quote, I'm done hiding this from myself and from the world. When I wrote in my book that I was lucky to not have PTSD, I was trying to convince myself, and I wasn't sharing the full picture. I still have nightmares.</p><p>Kander says he visited the V.A. in Kansas City on Monday. He tends to start getting help there regularly.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. A Chinese actress missing since June is apologizing. She's vowing to pay up after being ordered to pay $130 million.</p><p>BRIGGS: And steep declines in auto sales last month. How the trade war hits home, next.</p><p>[04:43:29] ROMANS: Missing Chinese actress Fan Bingbing ordered to pay nearly $130 million in back taxes and fines. CNN state media report the superstar is being investigated for tax evasion for misrepresenting earnings from various film projects. Tax authorities say they will not file criminal charges if he shakes the payments.</p><p>The actress has not been seen since June. She essentially disappeared from public view. Overnight she posted an apology letter on social media saying she will pay the taxes and fines, and it is unclear if she wrote that or was forced to by the Chinese government.</p><p>BRIGGS: The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami disaster has now jumped to 1,407. President Joko Widodo is meeting with survivors and visiting some of the most devastated areas including a hospital and hotel in Palu. His government taking heat for its slow response as displaced survivors desperately wait for aid and as Indonesia deals with the aftermath. There are reports of volcanic eruptions in the Northern Sulawesi and Java.</p><p>ROMANS: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travels to North Korea this weekend to meet with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. He's expected to lay the groundwork for a second Trump-Kim summit. This will be Pompeo's fourth visit to North Korea. The president canceled his last trip citing a lack of progress on denuclearization. Pompeo will also travel to Japan, South Korea, and China.</p><p>All right. Trade tensions hitting automakers. Car sales saw a steep drop as the threat of auto tariffs loom. Overall car sales fell 7 percent in September, Ford, Toyota, and Nissan all down at least 10 percent.</p><p>[04:45:04] One reason, demand for new cars is lower than last year. That's when Americans rushed out to replace cars destroyed in Hurricane Harvey. So, a tough comparison.</p><p>But also fear of tariffs on car imports prompted many shoppers to buy cars earlier in the year. Car companies face slowing sales just as costs rise. Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are raising those prices. And the new NAFTA, now called the USMCA, creates higher labor and environmental standards for the industry, likely means higher costs. Rising interest rates slowing sales. Interest rates affect borrowing costs like auto loans, auto loans get more expensive.</p><p>BRIGGS: Some industry experts think the result of NAFTA 2.0 is moving more car production out of North America to avoid all of this.</p><p>ROMANS: Could be, could be. It depends.</p><p>BRIGGS: We'll see.</p><p>Ahead, a woman finds a burglar in her garage. Wait until you see what she did to protect her kids and nab the suspect.</p><p>[04:50:37] BRIGGS: The internal watchdog for the Homeland Security Department says DHS was not fully prepared for the rollout of the zero tolerance at the U.S.-Mexico border. The new report says Customs and Border Protection detained at least 861 unaccompanied children beyond the legally allowed 72-hour time period and says DHS provided inconsistent information that left some parents unclear that they would be separated from their children. After three days of unannounced visits to nine detention facilities in Texas that hold immigrant children, inspector general's office found them, quote, mainly in compliance with federal standards.</p><p>ROMANS: The federal government charging four alleged members of a militant white supremacist group with inciting riots, and assaulting counterprotesters at last year's deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Prosecutors described the defendants as serial rioters. The criminal complaint says they were among the most violent individuals at the Charlottesville rally. Photos show some of these men seen kicking and slamming counter-protesters to the ground.</p><p>The four men face riot and conspiracy charges with a maximum five year prison sentence for each count. Three of the four appeared in federal court Tuesday. It's not clear if they have attorneys.</p><p>BRIGGS: Inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration seizing thousands of documents from the San Francisco headquarters of e- cigarette manufacturer Juul. The surprise inspection last Friday focusing on the company's sales and marketing practices. The FDA calls it part of an ongoing effort to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids. Big concern at schools and parents around the country.</p><p>Last month, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb called the teen use of e- cigarettes an epidemic.</p><p>ROMANS: Police in San Jose, California, using a murdered woman's Fitbit to track down her alleged killer. Ninety-year-old Anthony Aiello was arrested for the gruesome murder of his 67-year-old stepdaughter Karen Navarra last month. Navarra's Fitbit recorded a significant spike in her heart rate before a sudden drop off to nothing. The data helped police investigators construct the timeline and they arrested the stepfather. Aiello is being held without bail and is due in court tomorrow.</p><p>BRIGGS: Some beaches in Palm Beach County, Florida, are set to reopen after test results showed a reduction in levels of red tide. Testing by the Florida Fish and Wildlife officials showed very low to medium concentrations at 11 sites. But some nearby beaches from Lake Worth, north to the Martin County line, will remain closed.</p><p>Lifeguards and staff at these locations are reporting continued irritation. Red tide is the overabundance of algae, making it harder to breathe and making affected seafood dangerous to consume.</p><p>ROMANS: Some 400 guns stolen from a UPS facility in Memphis over the weekend have been recovered. The Chicago office of the ATF says the weapons cache was found in Midlothian, Illinois, about 20 miles south of Chicago. Two suspects have been charged, one in custody. Authorities are still looking for the other suspect, 24-year-old Roland Jackson of Chicago.</p><p>BRIGGS: In Arizona, millions of people drenched by the remnants of Tropical Depression Rosa. Watch here as firefighters rushed to rescue at least eight drivers from their flooded vehicles. North Phoenix hit hard by the flooding. People going to work had a hard time getting around.</p><p>This baseball field in Phoenix's park submerged. In south Phoenix, torrential rainfall causing a river to swell. Two full days into the month, it's already the fourth wettest October on record in Phoenix, with 29 days to go.</p><p>ROMANS: A brave mom in California holds a burglar at gun point until police arrived and it's all caught on surveillance video, the 25-year- old suspect caught here stealing a laptop in Brittany Morse's home. Her daughter found the suspect in the family's garage. Morris quickly shuttled her kids into a room and grabbed a gun she bought two weeks ago. She cornered the suspect and called 911.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRITTANY MORSE, HELD BURGLAR AT GUNPOINT: I had told the dispatch, I believe he has a knife on him. And I told him, you come near me, you take one step toward me, I will shoot you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: How terrifying. Taft City police showed up in two minutes. They arrested the suspect who had been in the garage for several hours. He was booked on first-degree burglary charges.</p><p>BRIGGS: It took five hours to decide. The Colorado Rockies outlasting the Chicago Cubs during the National League wild card game, 2-1, in 13 innings. An unlikely hero in the clutch. Third-string catcher Tony Wolters delivering the game-winning hit there.</p><p>[04:55:02] Colorado will now play the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Division series tomorrow. Tonight, the Yankees host the Oakland A's in the American League wild card game. The Rockies played in three time zones in three days.</p><p>ROMANS: Wow.</p><p>BRIGGS: They are, like us, exhausted.</p><p>ROMANS: Exactly. You're exhausted. You'll sleep all afternoon.</p><p>Let's check on CNNMoney this morning.</p><p>Global stocks mixed right now, but on Wall Street, the Dow jumped more than 100 points. A record high. You can thank optimism over getting that trade deal done, that uncertainty out of the way. This week, the U.S., Canada, and Mexico agreed to replace NAFTA. The biggest gains were from Boeing, Caterpillar, and 3M, manufacturers that rely on global trade.</p><p>The big tech stocks dragged on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. Amazon lost 1.6 percent after announcing it would raise its minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour for all employees. Facebook fell 1.9 percent on Friday. Facebook disclosed its largest data breach ever.</p><p>All right. It's been a tumultuous quarter for Tesla but in the end, it delivered on its promise. Tesla delivered 50 percent more, have than last quarter, 83,500, 56,000 were the low-priced Model-3. Tesla has struggled to get the Model 3s into the hands of customers.</p><p>So, this should calm investors' fears just as Tesla was in need of some good news. The CEO Elon Musk, remember, agreed to pay 20 bucks and stepped down as Tesla's chairman, settling SEC claims that Musk misled investors by tweeting that he secured funding to take Tesla private when the SEC says he hadn't.</p><p>In an interview with Vice News, Apple CEO Tim Cook says you should not believe tech companies when you tell this.--</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: The narrative that some companies will try to get you to believe is that I've got to take all of your data to make my service better. Well, don't believe them. Whoever's telling you that, it's a bunch of bong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Cook did not name names but likely means Facebook and Google. Both companies rely on data sharing with third parties. And they face a lot of criticism for how they protect user data. Cook added that he was not pro-regulation but that some is important.</p><p>I'm soul searching in tech about what to do.</p><p>BRIGGS: Does seem some regulation is on the way, even by the deregulation administration, yes?</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, I think so. But you get -- there's nerves in tech land about can Congress do this right.</p><p>BRIGGS: Sure.</p><p>ROMANS: They don't really think so.</p><p>BRIGGS: No proof yet.</p><p>EARLY START continues right now.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: How did you get home? I don't remember. How did you get there? I don't remember. Where is the place? I don't remember. How many years ago was it? I don't know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: President Trump with his most direct attack yet on Christine Blasey Ford. The FBI now expanding the Kavanaugh investigation. Who are they talking to now?</p><p>BRIGGS: Fraud, sham corporations, and more. A revealing \"New York Times\" report on President Trump's family taxes suggests he's not the self-made millionaire he claims.</p><p>ROMANS: A rising star in the Democratic Party pulls out of a mayoral race citing post traumatic stress from military service.</p><p>BRIGGS: Some of the highest rain totals ever for Phoenix as a tropical depression rolls through the desert.</p><p>ROMANS: And an instant classic. It took 13 innings, but the Colorado Rockies are headed to Milwaukee. The Cubbies, they're staying home. Poor Cubbies.</p><p>Good morning, and welcome to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: They got their World Series.</p><p>I'm Dave Briggs. It's Wednesday rock-tober 3rd, that's what they call it in Colorado. It's 5:00 a.m. in the East, 3:00 a.m. in Denver.</p><p>As soon as today, the FBI might deliver the report on Brett Kavanaugh to the White House and Capitol Hill. That news coming as sources tell CNN the bureau is expanding its inquiry into sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee.</p><p>Two sources say the FBI is now focusing on other high school friends of Kavanaugh. He listed them as attending a July 1, 1982 party, and the calendar he provided to the Judiciary Committee. It's not clear that the additional interviews will prolong the investigation.</p><p>ROMANS: Kavanaugh vehemently denied allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her at a high school party. She also said she does not remember some of details. The president seized on that admission at a rally last night, going further than ever before in attacking her.</p><p>Senior White House correspondent Jeff Zeleny was there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Christine and Dave, President Trump in South Haven, Mississippi, on Tuesday night for a campaign rally, the second campaign rally in as many days. And, of course, we're five weeks before the critical midterm elections.</p><p>The president talking about Judge Kavanaugh, the brutal confirmation process. But he did something that he has not yet done during the course of all of this -- he mocked Christine Blasey Ford, the California research psychologist who accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her some 36 years ago. This is what he said --</p><p>TRUMP: I had one beer. Well, do you think -- nope. It was one beer. Oh, good.</p><p>How did you get home? I don't remember. How did you get there? I don't remember.</p><p>Where is the place? I don't remember. How many years ago was it? I don't know.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What neighborhood was it in?

Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump wants to \"remove or change\" a provision of a law known as Section 230 that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users.</p><p>Trump said U.S. Attorney General William Barr will begin drafting legislation \"immediately\" to regulate social media companies.</p><p>On Wednesday, Reuters reported the White House's plan to modify Section 230 based on a copy of a draft executive order that experts said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny. The final version of the order released on Thursday had no major changes except the proposal for a federal legislation.</p><p>\"What I think we can say is we're going to regulate it,\" Trump said before the signing of the order.</p><p>\"I've been called by Democrats that want to do this, so I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation,\" said Republican Trump, who is running for re-election in November.</p><p>Twitter called the order \"a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law\" and said attempts to weaken Section 230 would \"threaten the future of online speech.\"</p><p>A Google spokeswoman said the order would harm \"America's economy,\" while a Facebook spokesman said it would \"encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone.\"</p><p>The order, as written, attempts to circumvent Congress and the courts in directing changes to long-established interpretations of Section 230. It represents his latest attempt to use the tools of the presidency to force private companies to change policies that he believes are not favorable to him.</p><p>\"In terms of presidential efforts to limit critical commentary about themselves, I think one would have to go back to the Sedition Act of 1798 - which made it illegal to say false things about the president and certain other public officials - to find an attack supposedly rooted in law by a president on any entity which comments or prints comments about public issues and public people,\" said First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams.</p><p>Jack Balkin, a Yale University constitutional law professor, said \"the president is trying to frighten, coerce, scare, cajole social media companies to leave him alone and not do what Twitter has just done to him.\"</p><p>Twitter's shares ended over 4 percent down on Thursday. Facebook ended down 1.6 percent and Google parent Alphabet Inc finished slightly up.</p><p>Trump, who uses Twitter virtually every day to promote his policies and insult his opponents, has long claimed without evidence that the site is biased in favor of Democrats.

Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump wants to remove or change a provision of a law known as Section 230 that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users.</p><p>Trump said U.S. Attorney General William Barr will begin drafting legislation immediately to regulate social media companies.</p><p>On Wednesday, Reuters reported the White Houses plan to modify Section 230 based on a copy of a draft executive order that experts said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny.

It represents his latest attempt to use the tools of the presidency to force private companies to change policies that he believes are not favorable to him.</p><p>In terms of presidential efforts to limit critical commentary about themselves, I think one would have to go back to the Sedition Act of 1798 - which made it illegal to say false things about the president and certain other public officials - to find an attack supposedly rooted in law by a president on any entity which comments or prints comments about public issues and public people, said First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams.</p><p>Jack Balkin, a Yale University constitutional law professor, said the president is trying to frighten, coerce, scare, cajole social media companies to leave him alone and not do what Twitter has just done to him.</p><p>Twitters shares ended over 4 percent down on Thursday. Facebook ended down 1.6 percent and Google parent Alphabet Inc finished slightly up.</p><p>Trump, who uses Twitter virtually every day to promote his policies and insult his opponents, has long claimed without evidence that the site is biased in favor of Democrats.

The proposed legislation is part of an executive order Trump signed on Thursday afternoon. Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Trump wants to \"remove or change\" a provision of a law known as Section 230 that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users. </p><p>Trump said U.S. Attorney General William Barr will begin drafting legislation \"immediately\" to regulate social media companies. On Wednesday, Reuters reported the White House's plan to modify Section 230 based on a copy of a draft executive order that experts said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny. The final version of the order released on Thursday had no major changes except the proposal for a federal legislation. \"What I think we can say is we're going to regulate it,\" Trump said before the signing of the order. \"I've been called by Democrats that want to do this, so I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation,\" said Republican Trump, who is running for re-election in November. Twitter called the order \"a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law\" and said attempts to weaken Section 230 would \"threaten the future of online speech.\" A Google spokeswoman said the order would harm \"America's economy,\" while a Facebook spokesman said it would \"encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone.\" The order, as written, attempts to circumvent Congress and the courts in directing changes to long-established interpretations of Section 230. It represents his latest attempt to use the tools of the presidency to force private companies to change policies that he believes are not favorable to him. \"In terms of presidential efforts to limit critical commentary about themselves, I think one would have to go back to the Sedition Act of 1798 - which made it illegal to say false things about the president and certain other public officials - to find an attack supposedly rooted in law by a president on any entity which comments or prints comments about public issues and public people,\" said First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams. Jack Balkin, a Yale University constitutional law professor, said \"the president is trying to frighten, coerce, scare, cajole social media companies to leave him alone and not do what Twitter has just done to him.\" Twitter's shares ended over 4 percent down on Thursday. Facebook ended down 1.6 percent and Google parent Alphabet Inc finished slightly up. Trump, who uses Twitter virtually every day to promote his policies and insult his opponents, has long claimed without evidence that the site is biased in favor of Democrats. He and his supporters have leveled the same unsubstantiated charges against Facebook, which Trump's presidential campaign uses heavily as an advertising vehicle. On Thursday, Trump said there is nothing he would rather do than get rid of his Twitter account but he had to keep it in order to circumvent the press and get his version of events to millions of followers. He took to Twitter again Thursday night to cast doubt around voting by mail, tweeting the practice would lead to \"MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE\" and \"THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY.\" The protections of Section 230 have been under fire for different reasons from lawmakers including Big Tech critic Senator Josh Hawley. Critics argue that they give internet companies a free pass on things like hate speech and content that supports terror organizations. Social media companies have been under pressure from many quarters, both in the United States and other countries, to better control misinformation and harmful content on their services. Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on the company's website late Wednesday that the president's tweets \"may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot. Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.\" After labeling Trump's tweets, Twitter continued to add fact-checking and 'manipulated media' labels on hundreds of other tweets. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's planned order \"outrageous\" and a \"distraction\" from the coronavirus crisis. Under the order, the Commerce Department has 60 days to petition the FCC to adopt new rules and then the agency will review the petition. It could take anywhere from 12 to 24 months for the FCC to propose and adopt final rules. Federal spending on online advertising will also be reviewed by U.S. government agencies to ensure there are no speech restrictions by a company.

It represents his latest attempt to use the tools of the presidency to force private companies to change policies that he believes are not favorable to him.</p><p>\"In terms of presidential efforts to limit critical commentary about themselves, I think one would have to go back to the Sedition Act of 1798 - which made it illegal to say false things about the president and certain other public officials - to find an attack supposedly rooted in law by a president on any entity which comments or prints comments about public issues and public people,\" said First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams.</p><p>Others like Jack Balkin, a Yale University constitutional law professor said \"The president is trying to frighten, coerce, scare, cajole social media companies to leave him alone and not do what Twitter has just done to him.\"</p><p>Twitter's shares were down 4.4% on Thursday. Facebook was down 1.7 percent and Google parent Alphabet Inc was up slightly.</p><p>Trump, who uses Twitter virtually every day to promote his policies and insult his opponents, has long claimed without evidence that the site is biased in favor of Democrats. He and his supporters have leveled the same unsubstantiated charges against Facebook, which Trump's presidential campaign uses heavily as an advertising vehicle.</p><p>On Thursday, Trump said there is nothing he would rather do than get rid of his Twitter account but he had to keep it in order to circumvent the press and get his version of events to millions of followers.</p><p>The protections of Section 230 have often been under fire for different reasons from lawmakers including Big Tech critic Senator Josh Hawley. Critics argue that they give internet companies a free pass on things like hate speech and content that supports terror organizations.</p><p>Social media companies have been under pressure from many quarters, both in the United States and other countries, to better control misinformation and harmful content on their services.</p><p>Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on the company's website late Wednesday that the president's tweets \"may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot.

President Donald Trump nominated National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) senior adviser Nathan Simington for the role of FCC Commissioner, Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society reported . The article said that Simington \u201cplayed a significant role in the agency\u2019s social media regulation agenda.\u201d Benton Institute suggested that, if confirmed, \u201cthe nomination would represent a significant blow to Republicans who favor a light-touch approach to telecom policy.\u201d    Benton Institute added that \u201chis nomination would be a victory for Republicans who want to see the FCC take a larger role in regulating social networks.\u201d It also noted that \u201cIn Aug, President Donald Trump abruptly withdrew Commissioner O\u2019Rielly\u2019s nomination after O'Rielly gave a speech opposing making changes to Section 230.\u201d    The Verge echoed this same idea that Simington played a critical role in \u201cdrafting a petition required under the Trump administration\u2019s social media executive order issued over the summer.\u201d    Indeed, the Trump administration called on the FCC to clarify Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act after years of alleged liberal bias among Big Tech companies . The FCC announced a call for public comment for 45 days regarding the Trump administration\u2019s petition on August 3.    Liberal tech outlet The Verge acknowledged that Simington\u2019s nomination would be a game-changer for Big Tech:     \u201cIf Simington\u2019s nomination is approved in the Senate, the FCC would have two Republican commissioners likely in favor of voting to approve the administration\u2019s social media order. Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr penned an op-ed in Newsweek  last month arguing that the FCC should require social media platforms to submit transparency reports similar to what internet service providers already do.\u201d   Conservatives are under attack. Contact the FCC at 1-888-225-5322  or tweet at the official @FCC Twitter account and demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on \u201chate speech\u201d and equal footing for conservatives.

Experts say that if regulators step up enforcement, companies could be forced to significantly overhaul their lucrative ad-targeting strategies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) surprised tech watchers last week by charging Facebook, one of the world's largest players in online advertising, with encouraging and enabling housing discrimination through its targeted advertising practices. The agency argued that the practices allowed realtors and landlords to exclude certain demographics from seeing housing ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HUD also accused Facebook of excluding women, minorities, disabled populations and other protected groups from seeing certain ads even when the advertiser did not intend to do so.</p><p>A HUD official confirmed to The Hill that the agency at the end of last year sent letters requesting meetings with Google and Twitter to talk about their housing advertisement practices.</p><p>Lawmakers hailed the move and said they would be watching the probe closely.</p><p>\"I think HUD has an obligation to look at all platforms to ensure that these algorithms don't allow, or even accelerate, discrimination,\" Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told The Hill. \"The ability to target ads is essential for their business models but if they're targeting ads in such a way that prevents people from getting a public service, that's not just wrong, it's against the law.\"</p><p>The Congressional Black Caucus, which for years urged regulators to look into whether Facebook's ad-targeting practices were discriminatory, told The Hill that it is \"monitoring\" HUD's probes into Twitter and Google.</p><p>\"We believe all companies should be compliant with any federal law that combats and prevents any form of discrimination,\" said Gabrielle Brown, spokeswoman for the caucus, in a statement.</p><p>The agency's moves surprised many Trump administration critics who say officials have not done enough on civil rights enforcement. And for tech companies, it opened a new front for an industry already under immense scrutiny from Washington.</p><p>But watchdog groups welcomed the actions and noted that alleged discrimination is not a new problem for the tech industry.</p><p>Facebook in recent years has seen a barrage of lawsuits and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints from civil society groups claiming the social media giant allowed advertisers to exclude or target ads based on users' gender, age, race, national origin, familial status and more.</p><p>In response, Facebook earlier this month announced sweeping changes to its targeted advertising practices in housing, employment and credit, three industries protected under federal civil rights laws.</p><p>Advertisers dealing with housing, employment and credit will now be held to different standards on Facebook. They will not be allowed to target users based on age, gender or zip code, and they will have far fewer microtargeting options that could be used as proxies to exclude protected classes.</p><p>\"With Google and Twitter, we definitely would see similar concerns,\" Miranda Bogen, a senior policy analyst with digital civil rights group Upturn, told The Hill. \"Any ad platform that allows this sort of ad-targeting, or that tries to optimize delivery to the right kind of people, will have to grapple with the same sort of issues that Facebook has been called out for.\"</p><p>Twitter allows advertisers to target users based on their gender and zip code, and it does not treat housing, employment and credit opportunities differently.</p><p>The company prohibits ad targeting based on categories including racial or ethnic origin, negative financial status, health, political affiliation, religious background, sexual orientation, gender identity and more.</p><p>But it offers targeting options based on users' familial status, including whether they are single or have children. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on familial status, including against families with children under 18.</p><p>\"That's something regulators have been attentive to,\" Bogen said. \"It's not appropriate to exclude parents with kids from certain types of housing.\"</p><p>If users see an advertisement that could violate the law on Twitter, they are encouraged to report it to the company, but civil rights lawyers argue that is not enough.</p><p>\"There is not a distinction made on those platforms that makes clear that targeting in that manner is unlawful if the advertisements are for opportunities related to employment, housing or credit,\" Galen Sherwin, who helped settle the Facebook case with the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Hill. \"It's left to the advertisers to regulate themselves.\"</p><p>Sherwin and Bogen say there are a number of other, less obvious ways that targeted ads can enable discrimination. For example, they highlighted concerns about using zip codes for targeted ads, which could be a proxy for race due to the country's legacy of racial segregation. Both Twitter and Google offer advertising based on geographic location.</p><p>Google allows advertisers to target users according to their online activity on its platform, particularly their search terms, as well as their location.</p><p>\"Browsing behaviors, and the similarities between them, could end up creating a demographically homogeneous audience without anyone articulating that that should happen,\" Bogen said.</p><p>Google and Twitter also offer advertisers a \"lookalike\" targeting option that targets ads at users that are deemed similar to the advertiser's intended audience.</p><p>HUD is taking issue with Facebook's own lookalike targeting option, claiming it \"uses the protected characteristics of people to determine who will view ads regardless of whether an advertiser wants to reach a broad or narrow audience.\"</p><p>Asked about the HUD probe, a Google spokesman said the company has policies that \"prohibit targeting ads on the basis of sensitive categories like race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, disability status, negative financial standing, etc.\"</p><p>Google does have specific policies around advertising financial products and services, including barring payday loan advertisements, but it does not provide many specifics around its treatment of employment, housing and credit opportunities.</p><p>Google and Facebook together accounted for 58 percent of the $111 billion digital ad market in 2018, with Twitter having a much smaller footprint.</p><p>Deirdre Mulligan, a professor at University of California, Berkeley who has researched ad discrimination, told The Hill that HUD is raising questions about whether these companies \"have a responsibility to think through the ways in which their algorithms on their own might lead to biases in who receives ads.\"</p><p>There are also many questions about the ad practices.</p><p>Google, Twitter and Facebook have not disclosed how many housing, credit and employment advertisements are on their platforms each year. And none of the companies share detailed information about ad targeting by demographics, posing a significant challenge to researchers and regulators.</p><p>Negotiations between HUD and Facebook during the investigation broke down after the agency requested \"sensitive user data,\" Facebook said in a statement following the charges. Similar issues would likely arise during any HUD probe into Google's and Twitter's ad-targeting practices.</p><p>Industry watchers say tech companies should be on high alert. And lawmakers are already calling on regulators to expand their investigations.</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said \"big tech\" should not be shown \"leniency\" when it comes to the landmark Fair Housing Act, which HUD claims Facebook violated.</p><p>\"For too long, big tech has been given a pass on a lot of legal enforcement that applies to other industries,\" Blumenthal told The Hill.</p><p>\"Maybe HUD should be looking at other companies if there are credible allegations.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-40G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

And that Commerce Dept. officials have been meeting with tech giants like Facebook and Google, as well as such Internet providers as AT...ahead of moving forward on any proposal. </p><p>The goal appears to be to craft a set of principles for how companies should collect and handle private consumer information, according to reporting from The Washington Post[1]. Which, of course, goes right to the core of how Facebook and Google operate and gives them plenty reason to worry about the direction that the first comprehensive online privacy law could take, should such a thing materialize. Trump deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters in a statement said that 'Through the White House National Economic Council, the Trump Administration aims to craft a consumer privacy protection policy that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity. We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution consistent with our overarching policy.' Worth pointing out, as the WaPo goes on to note, is that there's no single federal law controlling the way big tech giants collect and monetize data harvested from users. And that it's also getting increasingly difficult to ignore tougher standards coming out of Europe and elsewhere, especially with missteps Facebook keeps making. Of course, even Facebook's CEO has conceded[2] that some degree of new regulation may be in order. Facebook and Google lobbied intensely back in 2012 to block passage of a proposed consumer 'bill of rights' focused on online privacy under the Obama administration. Could things be different now? Momentum is certainly building in this direction. Earlier this summer, for example, California pushed into law the California Consumer Privacy Act, which takes effect in 2020 and is regarded as the toughest such legislation in the country. It lets consumers ask companies who their data has been sold to, among other things. Facebook's response to this will be interesting, especially because the company is starting to talk about itself in a whole new light. Maybe even, dare we say it, admitting that it's becoming an entirely different company. From a Facebook regulatory filing[3] this week, the company makes two things clear: It acknowledges running out of people to slurp up into its big blue empire. And it's also going to be increasingly reliant on less lucrative business models. 'We will continue to invest in our messaging, video content, and global connectivity efforts, as well as other initiatives that may not have clear paths to monetization,' the filing explains. Translation: Even Facebook knows that things are changing. Perhaps that includes legislatively, too.

As President Trump and his administration approach the final year of their term, nearly every citizen on the globe, even in the midst of political turmoil and acrimony, can come to one conclusion-this eventful Presidential will fill the history books of the future. At the core of President Trump's policy, he and his administraiton have placed a key emphasis on an 'America First' economic and military policy, lax monetary policy, the revamping of the American healthcare system, illegal immigration and asserting America's political dominance across the East. From the beginning of his campaign for the 2016 U.S Presidential Election, President Trump always appeared as a bombastic, brazen demagogue who appealed mainly to the non-university portion of the voting population; he expressed an understanding for the rather stereotypical perspective of the average American while living an ostentatious life of private jets and gold walls.</p><p>Some of the highlights of Trump's campaign promises included stripping America's latest healthcare overhaul, the Affordable Care Act, which was enacted during the Obama administration; building a massive border wall on the U.S Mexico border, which would cost the U.S government a whopping USD 21 billion; and enacting economic policies to retain a greater share of manufacturing jobs within the U.S . After three years in office, President Trump and his administration has received mixed results in their promises. Also-and as expected-his Presidential has been rife with controversies, endless media coverage and social media maelstorms. The public deserves a recount of such a lively President and Presidential Term.</p><p>President Trump is likely one of the most eccentric individuals to hold the title of 'Most Powerful in the World'. Contrary to his predecessors, dislikes reading detailed documents to gain an understanding of a particular situation, instead preferring to receive oral briefings from U.S intelligence briefers. In addition, President Trump reportedly allocates a large portion of his day to 'executive time', which is simply unstructured free time where the President does whatever comes to mind. Multiple news and media platforms, such as Axios and CNN, have criticized the President's work routine and his overuse of 'executive time'. Reportedly, President Trump gains most of his world news briefings by watching close to eight hours of television during the day, most of it in the night and early hours of morning.</p><p>The President's eccentric personality is further complemented with a similar Presidential Cabinet and White House structure. By the end of the President's first year in office 34% of White House staff and Cabinet members had either been fired or had resigned. Among some of the more shocking exits were the firing of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and FBI Director James Comey and the resignation of Secretary of Defence James Mattis. Michael Flynn in February 2017 amidst concerns of him lying to Vice President Mike Pence about President Trump's Conversation with the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. This was during the height of media coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential polls. Mr.Comey was then fired in May of that year, with the President claiming he followed the advice for Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Comey was at the time investigating a case of Trump's electoral team colluding with Russian intelligence, and his departure instigated further speculations into President Trump's possible ties with the Russians. Finally, in December of 2018, Mr. Mattis handed his resignation letter to the President after President Trump ordered the removal of the last 2,000 U.S troops in war-torn Syria, defying the suggestions of military advisors and strategists.</p><p>President Trump has always maintained his image as an eccentric populist who has harbored a toxic hate for mainstream media outlets throughout the world. The President has repeatedly described mainstream US media outlets such as CNN, NBC and the New York Times as being creators of 'fake news' and 'among the most dishonest human beings on the planet'; accused media and news agencies have denied accusations of preaching and proliferating fraudulent content. One of the first and most serious incidence of the President accusing these media outlets was right after his inauguration ceremony, where he accused media companies of understating the number of people that had attended the ceremony. Photographs from the ceremony and comparisons with that of previous Presidential inaugurations later disproved the claims of President Trump and his Press Secretary, Sean Spicer. Later during his term, the President Trump engaged in an intense vilification of mainstream media outlets, where he repeatedly mocked and condemned news and media outlets for misrepresentation of his accomplishments and the agenda of his administration. Unsurprisingly, the U.S President hasn't been an ardent supporter of Presidential conferences as he has so far participated in one of them; moreover, President Trump and his administration have blocked press agencies from attending briefings. As recently as June 2019, President Trump threatened to send a Time journalist to jail if Time magazine published a photo of the letter North Korean dictator had given to President Trump. Multiple media outlets, most notable the New York Times, have denounced the President's passionate criticism of mainstream media, branding the accusations as a violation of the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, two key cornerstones of the American constitution and ideology.</p><p>From a policy point of view, President Trump's environmental policy seems to belong to a rather by gone era, as he has often stated his disbelief in the concept for climate change. In alignment with his beliefs, the president first removed the U.S from the Paris Climate Accords, a non-binding agreement signed by over 200 nations to reduce the effects of greenhouse gas and minimize climate change in the coming decades; also, the Trump administration has exercised unprecedented levels of lenience on regulated industries (coal, oil etc) as the US administration referred a record low of 30 commercial pollution cases for prosecution in 2018. Furthermore, President Trump has rolled back on several acts introduced by his predecessors, most notably the Presidential Climate Action Plan. During the length of his term, the President's administration has decreased emission limitations for various industries and removed sea level rise from consideration when developing governmental infrastructure. More notably, plenty of governmental funding for climate research have been held back; this was combined with a gradual dismantling of the EPA (Environment Protection Agency) in the U.S, which critics have accused of 'functioning with the interests of business' rather than environmental conservation. Shockingly enough, a day after the President declared the coldest Thanksgiving festival in recent US history, the U.S government released a 1600 page document detailing the disastrous effects of climate change that would ensue if current levels of emissions were maintained globally.</p><p>From the inception of his campaign, President Trump held a conventional Republican view on immigration-to detain every single illegal immigrant. Consequently, the president's philosophy on immigration has resulted in record numbers of illegal immigrants (mostly Mexican nationals) being detained in the US by ICE forces. However, his administration has still failed to secure funding for an extension of the U.S-Mexico border wall. In addition, the President has enacted several executive orders that prevents citizens from several war-torn middle eastern nations-including Syrian refugees attempting to seek asylum-from entering the U.S. So far the number of detainees detained by ICE has increased a whopping 40% compared President Obama's term. Additionally, President Trump's policies have placed quotas on legal immigrants by embracing the RAISE act of 2017, which seeks to reduce the number of legal immigrants in the U.S by 50%. Several democrats has condemned President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration on the US-Mexico border as it has separated countless young mexican children from their families, who are forced to reutrn to Mexico while their kids are confined inside ICE detainee shelters; media reports have revealed several children dieing as well within these shelters. However, eliminating the DACA policy, signed by President Obama to offer the children of illegal immigrants with a legal working status in the US, caused the most controversy.</p><p>Lastly, it would be incomplete to describe President Trump's first term without delving into his economic policy, which comprises and related to a great deal of U.S foreign policy. President Trump's economic and foreign policy has been characterized by threats, hostility, abruptness and economic sanctions (notably tariffs). As of now, the Trump administration is fighting a major trade war with China, has placed sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Venezuela and plenty of major trading partners and stripped NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) for the USMCA trade agreement- in short, a lot of fighting, threats, political quarrels and rebuilding. At the centre of his economic policy, President Trump has forged ahead with an 'America first' mindset, which favors trade protectionism and attracting big tech dollars into the local economy. Regardless, president twitter hailstorm of tariff declarations and military threats have caused a great amount of tumult in the global financial markets; markets have endured regular bouts of panic selling and periods of extremely high volatility during President Trump's term. While this upset businesses and investors alike, the local U.S economy has forged extremely well, recording impressive YoY GDP growth figures and lowest unemployment levels within the last 50 years. One of President Trump's major campaign promises was to end the U.S trade deficit with China; unsurprisingly, the trade deficit has ballooned along with U.S government debt as the President's administrations rolled out expensive corporate tax benefit programs. In a rather uncanny sequence of events, the US bond yield curves, a key indicator of recessions, has inverted, signalling an impending recession within the next 15 months.</p><p>One of the most recognizable characteristics of the current administration's diplomatic tactics is the rapid implementation and repealing of tariffs and economic sanctions; critics and investors have long since become used to this and have often disapproved of the abrupt announcements of tariffs as they render a business unable to adjust to near term headwinds. President Trump has a nature for strongarming other nations in accepting rather unfavorable economic and political terms, and, as expected, he has been generally met with heated denial from other nations; situations like these have often been addresses with the President threatening to levy taxes on imports from certain nations. While these threats and trade skirmishes often result in little agreement, they have soured U.S domestic relations and disrupted financial markets and economies throughout the world. The U.S President may be the most powerful being on Earth, but tweets that wipe trillions of dollars from national economies and financial markets within a few moments is an absolute misuse of such great power-as a platitude summarizes, 'great power comes with great responsibility'. The judgement of responsibility is rather a heated one, and thus is better left to individual opinions.</p><p>While there were 44 Presidents that came before the current President, Donald Trump has certainly distinguished himself a great deal from his predecessors and managed to break free from the conventions that have defined past US Presidents. From his inauguration, President Trump, albeit, with some heated controversies and debate, has proposed some rather alien and one-sided policies on a variety of issues. His time in office has been characterized with off-script speeches that have use rather colloquial and revealing language (likely in an effort to cater to the general masses) and controversial policy enactments and discussions- a great deal of which were introduced on twitter. In spite of all the dislike President Trump has received his dogged personality and knack of being able to blend with the minds of the masses have challenged the traditional view people have of a president: a suited executive who graduated from an Ivy League college and talks in convoluted, twisted English that seems origin to native ears. Perhaps that is the reason President Trump has rose to the limelight of global politics. Nevertheless, President Trump and his administration have been trailblazers in several regards, beginning with their acceptance of their populist ideology. This serves to support one fundamental truth: the principles and conventions of the world are continuously being repealed and replaced. Who knows what sort of President the U.S could be seeing in 2020- probably not a communist though.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Trump is worried that France's digital services tax, which would place a 3% levy on the French revenues of firms like Amazon, unfairly targets US companies.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] US President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into French plans to slam big tech companies, like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook, with giant new taxes. The probe, known as a Section 301 investigation, was announced on Wednesday night[2] by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. It could culminate in retaliatory tariffs, potentially opening up a new trade war. France's digital services tax, which was approved by the French senate on Thursday[3], would require tech firms with revenues of more than $845 million to pay a 3% tax on their French sales. This could raise about \u20ac500 million, or $563 million, for the French public purse every year, which French Finance Minister Bruno le Maire has said would amount to \"justice.\" Taxing revenue is meant to counter the complex arrangements most US tech firms have in place to avoid paying high taxes on their profits. Lighthizer's office said it has reason to believe that France is \"unfairly targeting the tax\" on US companies. As a result, Trump has called for the investigation.

Action against Europe would not be unprecedented for the US president, who imposed a 25% tariff on European steel and 10% on aluminum imports in May last year. Trump is already fighting trade wars with China and India. \"Trump preps for a trade war with France,\" was the conclusion of New York Times economic policy reporter Alan Rappeport[5]. Le Maire said Thursday that threats for the US are not the answer. \"I profoundly believe that between allies we can and should resolve our differences through means other than threats,\" he said, per Reuters. \"France is a sovereign country which makes sovereign decisions about its tax regime and it will continue to make sovereign decisions about its tax regime.\"UK plans almost identical taxFrance's digital services tax could be seen as a test case for other European countries to introduce similar tax regimes. The UK, for example, has announced an almost identical plan[6], which Boris Johnson, the likely next UK prime minister, has indicated his support for[7]. Trump's call for an investigation marks a change in tone for the president, who has spent weeks attacking America's biggest tech firms[8] over their perceived liberal bias and potential antitrust issues. He has even threatened to sue firms like Google and Facebook.NOW WATCH: 5 things wrong with Apple's lightning cable[9]See Also: Nintendo is moving production of its hit Nintendo Switch game console to

Defenders of the large web companies noted Twitter had removed large numbers of fake accounts, and said algorithms and efforts to address abusive content explained other issues.Trump's allegations of alleged bias typically feature three companies: Twitter, Facebook, and Google.  He cited the three companies by name at the White House on Tuesday.Although publicly critical, Trump recently passed up an opportunity to address his concerns behind closed doors when Google CEO Sundar Pichai visited the White House in December for a discussion about artificial intelligence. A source told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Examiner</emphasis> that Trump discussed his optimism about trade negotiations, including with China, but did not mention alleged bias.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2201230219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSV-X481-JBHT-D463-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"334\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

In fact, major technology companies have shown resilience to the pandemic, which in turn, significantly supported the market momentum this year. The S&amp;#38;P 500 Information TechnologyIndex has gained 26.4% so far (as of Sep 29) in comparison to the broader S&amp;#38;P 500's 3.2% rise.There is no doubt that the technology sector plays a key role in the U.S. economy but it has been under Trump administration's scanner for a long time. In fact, going by experts, the technology space will be subjected to increased scrutiny no matter which candidate wins the presidential election. </p><p>Trump &amp;#38; Technology Sector In his second tenure, Trump is expected to maintain and even expand the broad-scale regulatory scrutiny of technology companies, per the sources. The measures include antitrust investigations of Internet giants such as Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google and Facebook Inc. (FB), allegations of anti-conservative bias online and restricting actions against several China-owned apps such as TikTok and WeChat, per The Wall Street Journal article.Moving on, Trump is expected to emphasize on revoking Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act with the intention to scale back protections social-media companies are entitled to under it (as reported in The Wall Street Journal article). In fact, he tweeted on Sep 8 asking for a repeal of Section 230. Commenting on the issue, Samantha Zager, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said that 'President Trump will continue to advocate for an internet that embraces free speech over censorship,' per The Wall Street Journal article. Biden &amp;#38; Big Tech Joe Biden shares a stance similar to Trump regarding the market power that the major technology companies are enjoying, per the sources. He too advocates the repealing on the Section 230 but for a different reason. Biden wants social media companies to more actively and responsibly take down content that can be spreading rumours and false information, per The Wall Street Journal article. Also, experts believe that the Biden administration will take appropriate action to control and protect the jobs of workers that are potentially under threat due to technological innovations like self-driving vehicles.Biden's running mate Sen. Kamala Harris is believed to have cordial relationships with the technological sector during her previous term as district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general in California.The duo is believed to work on policies that will enhance the accountability and transparency of major technological companies instead of breaking up business units, per a S&amp;#38;P Global Market Intelligence article.It is a widely known fact that the tech industry relies on high-skilled immigrant visas to employ workers. Trump has had a very strict stance on the immigration policies which he considers a threat to the U.S. economy.Experts believe that the Biden administration will relax the immigrations policies to some extent to allow high-skilled foreign nationals to get recruited by big techs. At the same time, Biden will try to balance out the impact of the move on the employment environment and wages in the United States, per the sources. Technology ETFs to Consider Summing the big tech policies of the contestants, experts believe that the technology sector might get a more conducive environment under the Biden administration.

My God, what if he has, like, one of those new ice-makers that can make round ice cubes, you know, those ice balls?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Wow.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Yes, fancy.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 That changes everything.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 Not mundane.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Hey there. It's the NPR POLITICS PODCAST.             </p><p>                I'm Scott Detrow. I cover the presidential campaign.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 I'm Claudia Grisales. I cover Congress.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 And I'm Phil Ewing, election security editor.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And it's Friday. We have collectively made it through another week of 2020, some of us with brand new refrigerators to show for it. Congress is coming back to Washington, D.C., next week after a two-week recess. And, as usual, there is a lot to tackle. Claudia, that includes the National Defense Authorization Act, which, as it often is, seems to be about a lot more than authorizing money for defense.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Exactly. There's a very big scope this year, as there is every year. But this year, they're going to be looking even deeper into issues of racial injustice and concerns of discrimination and even police reform. And this is going to keep both chambers very busy next week. It's kind of creating a traffic jam, actually, because members also are looking at trying to push through another relief bill to address this coronavirus pandemic. And so they're having to try and work on both a little bit, if you will. And then in the meantime, they're going to try and move this defense bill through both chambers maybe as early as next week.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And we're going to talk more about that latest attempt to provide some coronavirus relief in a little bit. Can you talk about how this defense bill has really gotten wrapped up in the national conversation about racism that we've been having all summer?             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Well, it comes on the heels of attempts in both chambers to pass police-reform bills. And this came in the wake of national protests and national outcry for reform of police after the death of George Floyd. He was killed at the hands of police in Minneapolis. And so with that, they came up with some proposals - Democrats in the House did. Senate Republicans had their own, but neither moved out of their chambers. And so this defense bill comes on the heels of that - the heels of that conversation and the heels of the failure of that bill to move. And so what folks see - some Democrats I talked to see this bill as an opportunity for a must-pass legislation to be able to carry some of these concerns that they had when it came to the militarization of police; for example, limiting the kind of, quote, \"weapons of war\" that are passed down to police. Some folks think there should be a limit on that. We're going to see a debate on the Senate floor for that issue.             </p><p>                And on the House side, we're seeing a lot of members moving towards concerns of erasing symbols of the Confederacy and addressing discrimination in the ranks, creating panels to address the demographics among their members, who gets promoted. And on the Senate side, we're also seeing a really big debate as well on this Confederacy issue and trying to erase these tributes, especially when it comes to these 10 Army installations that still carry the name of confederates.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 You know, Claudia, the president has made a really big deal out of this this year in terms of his political messaging about Confederate flags and Confederate statues. Where are Republicans in Congress, more broadly, on those issues as you're looking ahead to this debate with the NDAA that's coming up?             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Yeah, we've seen a lot of twists and turns with this conversation, kind of bouncing off President Trump's reactions to these movements. You're familiar with it. You've reported on it as well. And when, initially, the Senate Armed Services Committee - this is who handles the defense bill - approved their legislation, it included a provision by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to ban these Confederate names. It would remove these kind of tributes within about three years. They negotiated a compromise. She wanted to see it done in about a year - she and other Democrats. And so soon after that, President Trump - he had already raised some concerns about the changing of names. But soon after hearing that Warren, one of his key nemesis on Capitol Hill, was pushing for this and got it in the bill, he threatened to veto it.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So, Phil, one other thing that's going to be happening during this next bout of Congressing (ph) is that there's going to be a high-profile hearing with a lot of big tech companies - the heads of Facebook, Apple, Alphabet, the parent company of Google. It's not like there wasn't a lot to talk about with these groups anyway. You and Miles Parks and our other folks focusing on election security have written so much about the various warning signs coming from the world of social media. But now this week, we've had a massive hack of Twitter that affected lots of high-profile people, including the likely Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. So what's the focus of this hearing?             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 So there are questions about their business practices, about potential antitrust implications from the House Judiciary Committee. And then there are also the things that our team has focused on this year about the way social media, especially on platforms such as YouTube and Facebook, has changed the way Americans talk with each other and created this huge avenue for false information, misinformation, disinformation and social agitation to come into the U.S. information ecosystem in a way that we saw in the 2016 presidential election and which has never stopped, which continues to this day. And these platforms with lower-level officials make regular reports to Congress about how they're doing with that. But this upcoming hearing will be the first time that their CEOs will have appeared together. And these aren't just any CEOs. These are the biggest dogs of all time - Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, which, as you mentioned, is the company that owns YouTube and Google.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So, Claudia, we're, like, two years or so into this new political framework, where it seems like Congress is out to make it clear that they are not approving of all of these big companies, rather than, you know, the decade or so before that, where it was, like, a rush to see who can be the coziest with Apple and Facebook and things like that. But we still haven't had that big sweeping regulation that was - been talked about so much. Is there any sign that Congress has any interest in moving past the confrontational hearing point of this?             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 In terms of addressing this concern, we have seen members here and there try to tackle this issue. But what they're facing right now in an election year is such a long list of to-dos that it's a difficult moment for them to try and tackle it. This is something that we could see maybe more traction come after the election, when they can focus more on these concerns.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 You know, the other thing, Scott, is these companies are popular because they're popular. Americans love Amazon. People love their iPhones. People love talking with the grandmother on Facebook. And how many of us haven't wasted more hours than we'd like to admit watching videos on YouTube? And so the political challenge for Congress is not only for old lawmakers to kind of get what technology is and figure out a way that it might be able to regulate it but overcoming the political barriers that come from their own constituents, from users themselves, for whom these companies and their platforms are actually pretty popular.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 That's a good point. Even as public opinion has changed on things like Facebook and Twitter, for instance, we're still mostly - most of us are on it every single day using it, despite what we tell pollsters and emote on those actual platforms.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 Right. And, you know, the premise for a lot of antitrust law in the United States is harm to consumers. But for those of us who are Amazon Prime members and who can get, you know, paper towels in two days or whatever, it's very hard to demonstrate that Amazon has hurt consumers by making them pay more or limiting the amount of choice that they have. That's a whole other thing that members of Congress and Amazon and Jeff Bezos will litigate. But it just addresses the fact that, as you said, this thread has been playing out in Congress for a long time without any result because, from the perspective of lawmakers, there's a lot of hurdles for them to overcome to actually get to the point of legislating.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So, Claudia, last question on this - in a normal election year, which we have well-established this is not...             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Right.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 You usually have - you know, this is the time of the year in an election year where Congress is trying to get the rest of the big stuff done so that they can spend late summer and fall trying to keep their jobs. And you're basically done legislating effectively from this point forward. Is that the case this year?             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 No. This is such an aberration from what we're used to. This is when things are supposed to be winding down for the year. And it has been quite a year already, but it feels like it's actually winding back up. They're getting closer to this confrontation on whether to provide any more relief to address the pandemic. Meanwhile, they're trying to push through this defense bill, and there is a very long list of concerns that they're trying to tackle as all of these crises are underway. There's even talk of the police-reform bill possibly getting revived. The Republican Senate sponsor - this is Tim Scott of South Carolina - said he has been keeping up with House Democrats over the break. And he says maybe there's a chance they could restart talks when they return, so it's a very busy time. It's only getting busier.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right. We're going to take a quick break. Phil, always nice to talk to you. Thanks for being on the pod.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 Thanks for having me.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Claudia, hang out. You and I are going to talk to Franco Ordo\u00f1ez about a story that he has about how the federal government is trying to snap up the latest round of emergency protective supplies.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And we are back and joined by Franco Ordo\u00f1ez.             </p><p>                Hey, Franco.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 Hey there.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So the coronavirus pandemic has, of course, continued to get worse in the U.S. We have now passed 75,000 new cases a day. That means once again, we're starting to see shortages in protective equipment that health care workers need. And, Franco, you had been doing some reporting on a surprising agency that the president has asked to try to fix this problem. What have you found?             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 That's right. I've been looking into the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. It's also known as the DFC. It's this agency that provides loans for U.S.-supported projects overseas. It's kind of a new agency - really just started rolling in the past year. The idea is to counter China's growing influence in the world. But Trump decided a couple of months ago that it should also be helping with the pandemic. Here's what he said in Pennsylvania.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 This federal agency normally invests in economic-development projects in other countries. I said, how about investing in our country?             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 In this case, it's basically operating as a bank. The DFC is providing loans for projects that help supply the national medical stockpile. That could include loaning money to a company seeking to convert a factory to manufacture items like masks, gloves, or gowns or pharmaceuticals.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So it's interesting - this is this new agency with a specific task. And that task is something a lot of people have worried about, especially in the past year as America really recedes from the rest of the world and China steps in to fill that development role. That seems like a pretty big job already. So what's the response been that the president is now asking this just-off-the-ground group to also tackle this other enormous problem?             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of concern about this agency, particularly in Congress because it took them some work to get this done. And it's got a big job already. And the concern is throwing this additional responsibility, as important as it is, and how it could undercut that main mission that you just discussed - kind of countering these authoritarian governments. That concern includes the attention of the leaders, people, resources - all of that important stuff that an agency needs as it gets started.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Franco, what is the agency's response to your reporting and what their role is here?             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 Well, Adam Boehler is the chief executive of the DFC. He came over from HHS. He's also a good friend of Jared Kushner. He said Trump didn't change the mandate, as some of these members of Congress are concerned about. He says Trump just added a domestic element - and a temporary one - to help fix a critical problem.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)                </p><p>ADAM BOEHLER:                 And, you know, my view on this is these are extraordinary times. Hopefully, it's once in a lifetime. And I think everybody, for the most part, understood why we would look to invest domestically.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 What Boehler says is that the DFC is basically a bank. That's the core function, and that is what's needed right now to get these projects off the ground. And he says the DFC being involved allows the Defense Department to focus on national security, the things that they do best, while the DFC can concentrate on getting the funding for the projects so they can get running.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 The fact that you mentioned that he's somebody who's friends with Jared Kushner jumps out to me. I think Jared Kushner obviously played a big role in the federal government response this spring and got a lot of criticism for big holes in that system.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 And Boehler was part of some of those efforts this spring. He's worn a few different hats in this pandemic because of his HHS health care background. He's been pretty involved with Kushner on these things. And he says that's part of the reason - you know, his background is why it was helpful for him to kind of take on this role in helping out with the funding because that's what the DFC does.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So, Claudia, let's broaden this out a little bit. We mentioned at the beginning of the podcast that obviously, one of the more important things on Congress's plate right now is some sort of next step of relief funding for this ongoing pandemic and the economic crisis that is going along with it. How is that conversation going in Congress, and what are the fault lines at this point for what exactly it should be focusing on?             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Well, right now, they're very far apart, and they're coming up on some critical deadlines. For example, at the end of this month, we're going to see this extra unemployment insurance payment - that is $600 on top of what unemployed workers get - that will go away by the end of this month.             </p><p>                And that was a big struggle between Republicans and Democrats, and it continues to be so. It's part of what's fueling this division between the parties on trying to meet in the middle. Republicans are emphasizing a plan to create a legal shield for businesses impacted by the pandemic. Meanwhile, Democrats want to see some significant aid once again for families, for state and local governments, for businesses. And Republicans are pushing back on that plan.             </p><p>                The Democrats already passed their proposal. The HEROES Act is what they've dubbed it. That is another large bill - about $3 trillion. Meanwhile, Republicans have been pushing back, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, saying, no, let's stick to a trillion. Let's not go past that. And that's going to be a very difficult task for both of these sides to meet in the middle. And we expect as they come back next week, we're going to hear a lot of spinning from both sides. And perhaps they can meet for some sort of negotiation in the days to come after that.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And, Franco, for months now, the Trump administration has tried to downplay any sort of second wave. It is very clearly here. Again, we passed 75,000 new cases a day this week. Have you seen any sort of shift in how the Trump administration is now dealing with this?             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 You know, Scott, I can tell you this. I mean, certainly, the president has pulled back from, you know, kind of leading this effort as he did in the first few months. Vice President Mike Pence is kind of leading the charge in this effort. And I think a big reason why is the politics of it. It is not a happy story.             </p><p>                The president is very focused now on his reelection campaign. His goal is to get things back to normal, and he wants to present that image, that narrative. But it's very hard to do when schools are not open, when people are still working in back bedrooms and there's still just so many challenges and health risks involved, especially as these cases, as you know, continue to rise.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And before we take one more break, some news that happened while we were taping this podcast - in a statement today, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says her cancer has returned and that she has begun a course of chemotherapy. She started it May 19, and she says it's yielding positive results. Obviously, there's a lot more to that story. You can follow along at npr.org. We're going to take a quick break. When we come back, Can't Let It Go.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 We are back, and we're going to end the week like we do every week with Can't Let It Go, the part of the show where we talk about the things we can't stop thinking about, politics or otherwise. So I will go first. Throughout the spring, one of the hallmarks of the coronavirus crisis was New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's daily briefings, which had a lot of information. He got a lot of praise. But to be honest, there were some weird moments where he would just kind of say whatever was on his mind.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And he had paused the daily briefings, but he was back. And this week, Cuomo unveiled something that fits into the weird category for sure. Apparently, Andrew Cuomo likes to design posters for fun.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 What?             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Oh, my gosh.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And he decided to commemorate New York's fight with the coronavirus. And after seeing that enormous spike in cases, New York does seem to really have it under control even over the last month or so. He decided to commemorate it by designing a poster. And it's like, to me, a mix of, like, a Dutch Renaissance painting where there's all sorts of stuff going on and different people in it and, like, a psychedelic '60s rock poster.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 It's very strange. Have either of you seen it?             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 No.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 I just pulled it up on my computer. I think it's kind of neat for a governor.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So I asked my friend - Jimmy Vielkind is the reporter for The Wall Street Journal in Albany. He has covered every single day of the Cuomo administration, which is a long time at this point. He has a physical copy of this poster, and I asked him to roll it out and describe it for us. So he sent this in.             </p><p>JIMMY VIELKIND:                 So Gov. Andrew Cuomo's new poster - it's a takeoff inspired by William Jennings Bryan, the politician from the turn of the century. It's centered around a big mountain, which is based on the curve of coronavirus infections in the state. It's sort of a big peak and then a slope going down.             </p><p>                So in Gov. Cuomo's mind - and he says he designed this poster - there's a rope that represents the curve. It's being pulled on by a group of people, including New Yorkers, health care workers, the governor's daughters, his dog Captain. And also in this poster, there are pictures of the governor, a picture of Donald Trump sitting on the moon, a rainbow, as well as a devil figure blowing the winds of fear and a economy falls waterfall leading to the sea of division.             </p><p>                So it's busy. There's lots going on here in this poster, including some tidbits into Gov. Cuomo's sense of humor. Favorite part is probably boyfriend cliff, which shows a young man with brown hair hanging from a cliff near the governor's daughters.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And the boyfriend cliff, which I don't know if either of you heard this at the time - when Cuomo just started talking at one of those pressers this spring about how his daughter's boyfriend had joined them for dinner.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Yes.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And he was...             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 I love that.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I guess he wasn't wrong, but, like, this whole riff about how as the parent, you need to - if you say you don't like a boyfriend, it'll make them like him more. But he does actually like this boyfriend. And it was, like - it was a lot.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Yeah, it sounded like the boyfriend was in deep trouble, so...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Maybe the boyfriend is not in trouble, or he's still in trouble. I can't tell (laughter).             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 But isn't that something that you would expect from a guy like Cuomo? I mean, he's a New Yorker. I mean, you got to be a little bit New York-ish (ph). I mean...             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I guess I would definitely expect, like, weird mind games with a boyfriend from someone like him but maybe not graphic design of a poster. That threw me.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Yeah. It's a new level.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 It is a new level.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right, Franco. What about you? What can you not let go of?             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 The thing that I can't let go of, which may not be as interesting and colorful but is definitely significant to me, is this question of whether kids are going to go back to school again in the fall and whether my own kids are going to go back to school again in the fall. I mean, just like so many people in the country, I'm waiting on what my school district is going to decide. I'm trying to prepare myself to figure out whether I'm going to be ready for the answer, whichever way it goes.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 There's just so many questions. You know, it's a month away before schools start. It's not that long ago. But, you know, remember when we were thinking about the two weeks to stop the spread, and we thought everything would be completely different after two weeks? Now it's like, man, I just hope we can get through this year or something. I mean, there's just so much uncertainty.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. It's a lot. And it feels like every outcome you've seen school districts announce feels impossible in its own unique way, right?             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Yeah. We had a deadline for our school district to put in whether you want to do in-person or remote. There's a revolt going on with teachers, and students are confused and trying to make decisions in mid-July for what happens in September. It's tough, and everyone's facing some major questions there.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 It's kind of like the can't let go of for the year for a lot of people.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 For the kids.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Claudia, what about you?             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 So my can't let it go is focused on the Twitter hack...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Oh, yeah.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 ...And all of the fallout from the Twitter hack and actually goes to a very dark path for me, which is my struggles - so when I didn't have a blue check mark. And for a year, I complained on Twitter.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 Oh.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 I tweeted at verified. I tweeted at people who were verified, saying, I'm jealous. How come you have a check mark and I don't? I harassed our social media manager...             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 ...And sent her messages. I tried to start a revolt in our newsroom. Finally, within about a year, I got that blue check mark. And I thought, oh, my God. I've made it. My nightmare is over. But no, that nightmare returned...             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 ...This week. And so in the midst of all this confusion Wednesday night, Twitter locked down verified accounts so we couldn't tweet. All these blue check marks were worth nothing at that moment.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 All the people who did not have blue check marks were having the times of their lives (laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 It was like the French Revolution for a while on Twitter. Like, the people rose up.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 Exactly.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 There were moments when that was happening Wednesday night that I thought maybe Twitter will just be over forever, and we can all just go away.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Alas, it was back a few hours later.             </p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES:                 And the haves and the have-nots were switched again.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right.

This is your CQ Cyber newsletter for Friday, Nov. 1, 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOPLINES</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Twitter's ad ban: The reaction to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's announcement that his platform would no longer sell political ads drew condemnation from the Trump campaign and praise from Democrats. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. FCC going after Huawei: At its next monthly meeting, the commission will vote on a proposal to ban the use of telecom equipment made by the Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3. Securing local governments: Senators from both parties are backing legislation designed to bolster cybersecurity by making it easier for state governments to use .gov domain names.</p><p>4. Privacy hearing looms: Ahead of a November hearing, a Big Tech trade group is asking senators not to follow the examples set by California and Europe in crafting privacy legislation.</p><p>5.  Crypto criminals: Law enforcement agencies are bolstering their efforts to detect and stop opioid traffickers from using digital currencies to help move illegal drugs.</p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Trump campaign rages at Twitter ban on political ads, while Biden offers muted praise</p><p>The debate over how technology platforms should handle the truthfulness of political advertisements took a turn on Wednesday when Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey -- in a clear dig at Mark Zuckerberg, his Facebook counterpart -- said the company would do away with political advertising completely. \"This isn't about free expression,\" Dorsey said. \"This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today's democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It's worth stepping back in order to address.\"</p><p>Twitter's position stands in stark contrast to that of Facebook, which has come under fire for a policy of not fact-checking political ads, effectively allowing candidates to pay to lie.</p><p>Zuckerberg has said the policy is an effort not to censor free expression or tell the public whether a candidate's speech is true or false, while critics have accused him of allowing disinformation to flow in order to turn a profit.</p><p>Brad Parscale, who is running President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, reacted to Dorsey's announcement by saying Twitter \"just walked away from hundreds of millions of dollars of potential revenue, a very dumb decision for their stockholders.\" Trump's campaign has already spent millions on Facebook advertising, including videos making false claims about former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>Biden's campaign manager, Bill Russo, praised Twitter for \"recognizing that they should not permit disproven smears, like those from the Trump campaign, to appear in advertisements on their platform.\"</p><p>2. FCC to vote on ban of Huawei, ZTE equipment in U.S. telecom systems</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission will vote this month to ban U.S. telecom companies from using equipment manufactured by the Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE in their systems, a decision that could heighten tensions between Beijing and Washington in ongoing trade negotiations.</p><p>The Chinese tech giants pose a threat to national security because of their ties to the government in Beijing, according to the U.S. intelligence community. But some U.S. telecom providers, especially smaller companies that operate in rural areas, have been reluctant to avoid Huawei and ZTE equipment because it comes at a lower price than similar equipment made by Swedish and Finnish manufacturers.</p><p>The FCC's vote, scheduled for Nov. 19, would force U.S. service providers not to buy from the Chinese companies as they begin to build their fifth-generation wireless networks, known as 5G, using funds provided, in part, by the U.S. government. It would also provide financial assistance for companies already using Huawei and ZTE to remove the equipment and replace it with parts provided by other manufacturers.</p><p>\"When it comes to 5G and America's security, we can't afford to take a risk and hope for the best,\" said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in a statement. \"We need to make sure our networks won't harm our national security, threaten our economic security, or undermine our values. The Chinese government has shown repeatedly that it is willing to go to extraordinary lengths to do just that.\"</p><p>Pai continued: \"We cannot ignore the risk that that the Chinese government will seek to exploit network vulnerabilities in order to engage in espionage, insert malware and viruses, and otherwise compromise our critical communications networks.\"</p><p>3. Bipartisan Senate bill would help local governments migrate to .gov domains</p><p>In an effort to stop cyber criminals from fooling the public by setting up fake government websites, legislation introduced in the Senate this week would instruct the Homeland Security Department to help local governments switch from web domains ending in .com or .org to domains ending in .gov.</p><p>The legislation, authored by Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., the committee's top Democrat, would require the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a component of DHS, to develop a strategy for engaging local governments about the benefits of a .gov domain and helping them make the switch.</p><p>The bill (S 2749) would also allow local governments to use existing DHS cybersecurity grants to cover the costs of the migration to a .gov domain. The legislation is co-sponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and James Lankford, R-Okla.</p><p>\"When official government websites use the .gov domain instead of alternatives like .us or .com, it makes those government websites and email addresses more secure,\" said Klobuchar, who is running for her party's presidential nomination. \"Unfortunately, right now most county and local governments don't use the .gov domain. This allows cybercriminals to more easily impersonate government officials in order to defraud the public and get people to share sensitive information.\"</p><p>4. Big Tech warns Senate not to follow California, Europe on privacy legislation</p><p>A trade group representing large technology companies including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google is urging the Senate Commerce Committee not to replicate \"the costly mistakes of California and Europe\" as it makes a year-end push for a bipartisan compromise on national data privacy legislation.</p><p>The committee is slated to hold a hotly anticipated hearing on privacy in November, Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., told Politico earlier this week. Wicker has been working behind closed doors with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., the panel's ranking member, to craft compromise privacy legislation. It remains unclear how close the pair is to an agreement.</p><p>But the news was enough to rustle Silicon Valley. In a letter to Wicker and Cantwell, the industry group TechNet said the senators should take stock of studies \"that show the harmful economic impact\" of both California's privacy law and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. </p><p>The group said the studies show why California and the EU \"should not serve as models for the entire U.S. and why Congress should forge a different path forward.\"</p><p>One study, prepared by Berkeley Economic Advising and Research, estimated the initial cost to businesses forced to comply with California's privacy law, which goes into effect in January, to be $55 billion, which is equal to about 1.8 percent of its gross state product in 2018.</p><p>The group referenced a separate study that asserts that the EU's regulations have had a negative effect on investment in European technology companies.</p><p>\"Congress should pass federal privacy legislation that promotes interoperability with existing frameworks, while avoiding the costly mistakes of California and Europe,\" TechNet wrote. \"In doing so, we can ensure that consumers' privacy and security are protected while enabling U.S. businesses to continue innovating and providing consumers with the experiences they have come to rely upon.\"</p><p>5. Cryptocurrencies complicate effort to stop opioid dealers</p><p>Criminals are getting better at hiding the cryptocurrency transactions they use to buy drugs online, my colleague Caitlin Reilly writes, adding a layer of growing difficulty to the fight against opioids.</p><p>The opioid crisis, which claims more than 100 lives a day, has been fueled partly by cryptoassets, but law enforcement is ramping up efforts to trace and halt their use in the illegal trade.</p><p>The Drug Enforcement Agency is \"very much concerned\" about the issue, an official from the agency told CQ Roll Call in an email. Criminal use of digital currencies to purchase drugs on so-called darknet websites, and even some publicly accessible ones, is \"widespread,\" the DEA official said last week.</p><p>The main purpose of using cryptocurrencies is to hide the transactions and the identities of those behind them. Of particular concern is fentanyl, which typically travels into the country from China or Mexico. The drug is a synthetic opioid, 50 times more potent than heroin, authorities say.</p><p>Two-thirds of the approximately 70,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2017 involved an opioid, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overdose deaths involving the drugs have increased almost sixfold during the past two decades, the agency said.</p><p>The DEA official said estimates of illicit transactions, including for drugs, conducted in bitcoin reach $76 billion annually, citing a 2019 report from Australian researchers Sean Foley, Jonathan Karlsen and Talis Putnins. </p><p>It is something even rank-and-file police officers must confront.</p><p>Sgt.

We are desperately looking for buyers and look at that market. This is what is driving the day, on Tuesday, November 20th. Yes, and you thought Monday was bad. There seems to be no stopping this market slide. Donald Trump says he is standing by Saudi Arabia, and Renault's board is deciding whether to ditch Carlos Ghosn.

We want to get right to those numbers for you, the Dow is moving back towards the lows of the day, all 30 Dow stocks are now in the red. And the Dow's gains for the year are gone, a distant memory.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has fallen into correction, that's a drop of 10% or more from recent highs. All sectors, and this is key, are in the red at this moment and the NASDAQ is now at a seven-month low. Look at the CNN business fear and greed index. Yes, I know you don't want to see it. We've got to give it to you. It measures volatility, momentum and demand for safe havens.</p><p>It is pointing to extreme fear. Alison Kosik is assessing the damage at the Stock Exchange. It is pretty much fear and loathing. I think a lot of people, Alison are wondering, has the market talked itself into this kind of a slip. The issue is, yes, we see slowing growth into next year, but there really is nothing else in the immediate horizon, is there? What are we all missing?</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, I mean there is negative news about tech stocks. I mean, you think about Facebook, there is negative news about how Facebook has handled the 2016 presidential election. What happened with Facebook, with that, and then you look at Apple, and the news about its marquee product, the iPhones which means we're seeing soft sales there.</p><p>So there is real hard news there driving these tech, these big tech names lower. But what is interesting is that, you look at these tech name, they're the drivers that propel the markets higher into those record highs that we talked about almost month after month, so far this year.</p><p>And they're the ones that are obviously dragging the market lower now. So there is a lot of negativity in the market. I can see a lot of glum faces here. I can't remember the last time during a holiday season I've seen the markets turn into red for the year.</p><p>And now we've still got a good month, month and a half to go before the end of the year, but it has really been a long time since we've seen the major indices turn to the negative. We're seeing that top turn negative, too. You know, 2018, 2019, we're supposed to be strong years, for the economy and now we're seeing analysts tweak their opinions and say no, maybe that recession that we have been talking about could be coming in 2020, it could be coming in 2019, because many analysts are seeing a global slowdown begin, Paula?</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, it is interesting all of that negativity, like you said, I was just there, it doesn't seem very festive at the market today and we are heading into some very low volume which also means more volatility. Alison, thanks so much. Now, we want to do a deep dive on some of these sectors. Tech shares are off as Alison was saying, but they were off the lows of the day.</p><p>The NASDAQ though is still below 7,000 and Goldman Sachs has lowered its price target on Apple and that is significant in terms of drawing down tech. Second, retail, shares of Target and Kohl's are down sharply. That's after earnings, despite that, Target's CEO insists there is no sign Americans are shopping less, and of course, energy. Those shares have tanked, right along with those oil prices, US crude is down nearly 7% for the day. Hanging over all of this, let's talk about those big picture macro factors.</p><p>Fears of an economic slowdown, the end of benefits from that colossal Republican corporate tax cut, higher interest rates, and of course, tariffs still looming. Navigating the market downturn takes an incredible amount of skill. We have two experts to help guide us, Ben Phillips is Chief Investment Officer at EventShares and of course, our own Julia Chatterley. Yes, like take a deep breath, exhale, we all want to be having chocolate at the stock exchange today. There is none of that going on.</p><p>Ben, I had certain people tell me, \"Look, no one should panic. This is not a bear market.\" What do you think?</p><p>BEN PHILLIPS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, EVENTSHARES: Well, the average draw down we've seen I think since 1930 has been a 14% peak to trough draw down. So isn't abnormal. To see we're not even at 10% yet in the S&amp;P. Now and the cues, the technology stocks are seeing more of that. People say they've officially entered bear market territory, but this right now overall is a normal correction, normal pullback that we see.</p><p>NEWTON: You know, Julia you have spoken to dozens of market experts literally. It must be a record by now in terms of what you have been hearing. When you have pulled it all together, are there fears? There are so many buyers on the sidelines right now, they're not piling in. Why not?</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE: I've had a lot of people say, look, we have to think of cash as an asset class now for the first time in a long time and I agree with what you're saying, this is a healthy correction, Ben, as well about this is a healthy correction and the talk has transitioned I think from it being a healthy correction to people saying, \"Look, almost half the shares out there now are in bear market territory, and if you don't have the big tech names as the leaders here, what lifts us higher? And I think that is a valid argument here, too.</p><p>In addition to all the concerns you made. I mean other people pointed at Federal Reserve rate hike in December and says that is really going to be a kicker for these markets at this time, too. So lots to think about.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes, and you saw Powell soften his language, right, so the Fed has softened their stance for the first time really and he is the king hawk, right? So it is good to see them softening the tone a little bit, but overall I think, we are still cautious on markets and we are very cautious on global trade being a catalyst, so we think what is being priced in right now in this correction is really just global trade risks starting to be priced in the market because they are actually affecting supply chains now.</p><p>NEWTON: And the two of you, please do not take it personally. We are on the lows of the day now. The Dow now down 632 points. Julia, when we look at everything that's out there right now, we're talking about growth slowing. Certainly, there is still isn't talk of a recession, what is this impending doom that some people seem to know something about but apparently hasn't actually been - it's starting to the priced into the market, and it's that oil price, right? You look at the deep on oil, and it really tends to be a global slowdown.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, so I think we have to separate what we're seeing in the markets from the fundamentals here, particularly for the US economy and that has played a leadership role in terms of the underlying growth metrics and I do think that's important.</p><p>I think we're finally - as Ben was saying there, acknowledging that there could be bigger trade risks here particularly if we see 25% tariffs applied in January and that's really I think starting to impact investors here, too. But I think we have to bring it back to the fact that this is a holiday week. It is Thanksgiving. US markets are going to be shut for a day and a half this week and I think for investors, even in the really, really short term here, do you want to be sitting on, if you're a short term trader, in particular, do you want to be sitting on risk, or holding stocks at this moment with the holiday for a day and a half? Bear that in mind here, too.</p><p>NEWTON: And Ben, Julia is really getting to the nitty gritty of this. Not only are we talking about this holiday week, but we are also just a few weeks from the end of 2018 and it is important that a lot of people want to show that ends of 2018, in the positive and not in the negative. What do you do? It seems like there is nowhere to hide here?</p><p>PHILLIPS: There is not many places to hide. I mean, we are looking at potentially putting on some more shorts. We haven't put on any shorts yet, we have a quantitative indicator that says when the market is going to take what we think is a bigger leg down. Right, now, it is teetering, it's right on the edge. So it's saying, we're at a point, a very decisive point from the market and the market is on the fence currently about which direction it is going to head.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How important is it here as well that we keep, trying to bring it back to fundamentals, but there are players now in the market, in serious size that don't make choices based on fundamental. They make choices based on price actions and when the market is going up, they buy and when the market is going down, they sell. That's a huge driver, too with the oscillations that we see and not just in stocks, but in other markets, too.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes, that's right. So we're fundamental investors at EventShares first and foremost, but as a portfolio manager, I've gotten more in tune with the technicals just because of how important it is to watch the technicals, that's what the quants are doing, the algos, the systematic trader, whatever you want to call them, the computers are trading, they amplify moves. So when we have a big down move, they pile on and the first down move, we think started kind of in June time frame. It wasn't really January-February, it was really June when we saw a rotation occurring.</p><p>We saw hedge funds de-risking. We saw them take risks down. Instead of running 200 long, 100 short, they took it down to 150, 75; so they cut their risk pretty massively and the quants pick up on that, and they pile on that trade.</p><p>NEWTON: Julia, my finest Prof always told me that look, the market is like Vegas. Don't ever mistake it for anything else, okay, and the point here now, to make that point, when we see those fundamental, perhaps we get good news on trade, maybe we start to see global growth and US growth looking better in 2019, at what point - what is going to settle this market down? Is it the trade issue that we are going to have a trade meeting really in two weeks?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I think you're the right person to answer this question because I would make this point and I have been all day. Silver linings. There is a lot of bad news baked into the cake here. What catalyst? As you said, Jay Powell actually just starting to soften the tone a bit, too. If that happens, if we get some kind of breakthrough on trade, for me these markets look right to be you know, toes back - back in their tippy toes --</p><p>NEWTON: Ben, what can you say with that?</p><p>PHILLIPS: That is probably the right way to think about it. I mean, being a contrarian usually is the most rewarding play to trade, right? So if people are all of a sudden very bearish on trade, we were bearish months ago and now we are seeing a plateau, really, this is the biggest risk for markets. If the trade breaks down, that is the biggest risk for markets.</p><p>NEWTON: And final word to Ben before I let you go. How much can the Fed mess this up if they tighten too much in 2019?</p><p>PHILLIPS: I don't think the Fed wants the blood on their hands for the next recession so I think they are going to be very thoughtful and look at markets and see what's happening in the equity markets and look at bond markets and use those indicators and as we saw, Powell is changing the tone based on live market feedback.</p><p>NEWTON: Lovely. Thank you to both of you, Ben. Have a great thanksgiving.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Thank you, Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: Julia, you're going to be suffering this market with me. I'll see you over the next few days. Appreciate it.</p><p>[15:10:05]</p><p>NEWTON: Now more breaking news tonight, a dramatic declaration from the US President. Donald Trump says the US remains a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia. He is upholding Riyadh, even though the Saudi Crown Prince may now have had knowledge, the CIA knowing that he may have had knowledge of the murder of journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. Now, Mr. Trump released a statement a short time ago saying he has no intention of canceling $450 billion in military contracts with the Kingdom. He stresses, he doesn't want to let Russia and China get those contracts instead.</p><p>He also praises Riyadh for working closely with Washington to keep oil prices lower. Indeed, they are low. And he says Saudi Arabia is spending billions to fight radical Islamic terrorism. CNN's Sarah Westwood is at the White House, for us, and Sarah, listen, there are a lot of people looking at this statement and saying that it is truly unprecedented from the White House. I know that we've said that many times, but if you have had a good inside look at the statement, what possessed the President to do this at this time, when he still didn't have apparently the full CIA report on his desk?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, Paula, I think that the CIA report delivered being delivered to the White House today could have played a role in the timing of the release of the statement. As you mentioned, the President was awaiting to receive that CIA assessment sometime today, even though he has been briefed continuously since Khashoggi's disappearance by the intelligence community.</p><p>This was supposed to be the latest CIA assessment of what went on in that consulate in Turkey. And according to reports, that assessment was going to include the relatively high confidence conclusion from the CIA, that the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman did have knowledge of the fact that Khashoggi was going to be murdered inside that consulate, and that has been a marker that many critics of this administration's response has thrown down, in terms of does this White House need to be tougher on Saudi Arabia, if it turns out that the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman was in fact aware that this murder was going to happen? Then the answer would be yes. If you ask some of the critics of this White House's response.</p><p>And this is coming, as the President is falling under increasing pressure from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill, to take that tougher action against Saudi Arabia. More sanctions, perhaps looking at re-evaluating that multibillion arms deal that the President mentioned in his statement, and what that statement did, Paula, was set himself up to avoid taking tougher action against Saudi Arabia and the Crown Prince, in particular, if he receives the CIA assessment today, and it says what we believe it will say, which is that the Crown Prince was directly involved in that murder.</p><p>The president trying to position himself to be able to avoid taking the path that his critics want him to take, which is imposing stricter measures against Saudi Arabia, Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: And now over to Congress, right, to see if they are going to do anything about this? Sarah, appreciate it. Now, CNN national security analyst Samantha Vinograd is here with now. Sam, thanks so much for hurrying on the set with us as we ended up getting this information from the White House. What's the message here? Because basically, it is as if - if you are an ally of the United States, you can do no wrong. You can basically run around the planet with a gun to anybody, a gun to the head of anyone you consider an enemy, right?</p><p>SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, CNN: Including a legal resident of the United States. Jamal Khashoggi was a Saudi, but he was legally residing in the United States. The message that the President sent today is quite simple. He not only is allowing Mohammed Bin Salman to get away with this murder, he is licensing him and anybody else who pumps oil, agrees to sign a memorandum of intent with the United States to buy US weapons or engages in significant commercial transactions with us to kill whomever they want, wherever they want and whenever they want.</p><p>So the President said this is about putting America first and promoting US national security interests, I think he would be hard pressed to find an American that feels safer knowing that Mohammed Bin Salman and the others feel so emboldened going forward.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet, if we take the contrarian view, some people cynically would say this is something that would have gone on in an Obama White House behind closed doors. So they would have tried to see what kind of leverage they could get out of the Saudis in the meantime, but then ended up to the same conclusion, we cannot afford to lose Saudi Arabia as an ally.</p><p>VINOGRAD: I worked for President Obama for four years and I can tell you that he would not have let - he would not have let, I just want to be clear, I worked for him for four years. I know that Saudi Arabia was an important ally to President Obama. Saudi Arabia engaged in humanitarian abuses, under President Obama, under President Bush, and multiple others. This is a gross escalation of what they previously had done, and I was in National Security Council meetings with President Obama, of course, he weighed all of the factors in the relationship.</p><p>This leader, sanctioned an assassination against a US legal resident, in a consulate in a foreign country. President Obama would not have been okay with that.</p><p>NEWTON: You called it a license to kill.</p><p>VINOGRAD: It is a license to kill. Why wouldn't Mohammed Bin Salman kill somebody again that hurt his feelings or said something nasty? What are the repercussions? Seventeen of his henchmen are sanctioned.</p><p>[15:15:10]</p><p>VINOGRAD: Okay, well, guess what? There are 17 more where those came from.</p><p>NEWTON: And more than that, you and I have discussed this before, Russia is watching very closely, right?</p><p>VINOGRAD: They are and it's exactly what we've done with Russia. We have sanctioned GRU intelligence agents of Vladimir Putin that have perpetrated his operations against the United States. Vladimir Putin clearly is not deterred. He is still attacking us.</p><p>NEWTON: Okay, I don't have a lot of time, but I do want two quick questions with you here. Would you have leveraged this? Because, you know, in terms of me looking at the conflict at Yemen, of someone who has covered Yemen and who's been there, it is heart breaking.</p><p>VINOGRAD: It is.</p><p>NEWTON: Would you have leveraged it to try and get the ceasefire in place or do you have confidence they're doing that right now?</p><p>VINOGRAD: I don't have confidence that they are trying to get a ceasefire in place. How many years are we into the conflict? Today is World Children's Day, and babies are suffering famine in Yemen. I don't think that you can really leverage human rights with oil production or ceasefire in Yemen. I think that you typically would want to treat those separately, because again, otherwise, you really, really just mix all of these different issues together.</p><p>NEWTON: Congress, can they do anything? Will they do anything?</p><p>VINOGRAD: Oh, certainly, I think that they will do something and in the first instance, there are intelligence committees in the US Congress. They can demand access to the intelligence documents and they can hold up these arm sales if the President actually sees them come forward.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, there's so much to talk about here. Sam, thanks for getting with us on the set. We didn't even get to the fact that in the statement, the President actually basically impugned the reputation of Jamal Khashoggi, by saying that he --</p><p>VINOGRAD: He did.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, he did. I encourage everyone to go and look at the statement. Sam, appreciate it so much.</p><p>VINOGRAD: Thank you.</p><p>NEWTON: The downfall of a legend. Carlos Ghosn is accused of pocketing millions of dollars meant for his colleagues and we are waiting to hear the CEO's fate from Renault. And Facebook is under fire. This time, an auction, for a child bride took place on the site. Fifteen days later, 15 days, after she was married, the post was taken down.</p><p>Okay, we of course are keeping an eye on the Dow, which suddenly hit the lows of the day, in the past few minutes. We have recovered somewhat, but that right there, down 558 points, nothing to write home about. We will continue to keep an eye on the markets with 40 minutes left to go.</p><p>Now, the US is, you're going to pardon this term, pigging out on current pork and beef prices as the recent result of Trump's trade war. The country is exporting less pork to both China and Mexico.</p><p>[15:20:02]</p><p>NEWTON: That is bad news for chicken producers such as Tyson Foods, whose quarterly sales are now lower. Dustin Baker is the Director of Economics at the National Pork Producers Council and joins me now live from Washington. I'm really curious to hear from you. I think when a lot of us have been reading about the gyration of these food prices, kind of shocked at how those tariff, even the threat of tariffs kind of shake out when it comes to domestic consumption. What's happened here?</p><p>DUSTIN BAKER, DIRECTOR OF ECONOMICS, NATIONAL PORK PRODUCERS COUNCIL: Well, no, you're exactly right and thank you very much for having me here. Certainly, this year has been very interesting for the US pork industry. At the beginning of the year, we were looking at profits for our farmers, and today, the narrative has changed a little bit.</p><p>As we look at pork prices in the retail space, government data last week showed that October pork prices were 4.5% lower than a year ago. That is coming off of record pork production in 2017. There are certainly opportunities there for consumers in the United States to be able to stock up on pork products as we head into the holiday season.</p><p>NEWTON: We can all only eat so much bacon even me who loves it. We can only eat so much. What are the worries for your industry going forward? Especially if this is a protracted tariff problem?</p><p>BAKER: Well, certainly, the US pork industry is very reliant on export markets because it helps producers derive more value for each hog that they produce. We're currently facing retaliatory tariffs in both Mexico and China, which are two of our largest markets. So right now, 40% of our pork exports are facing retaliatory tariffs.</p><p>Our number one mission all along has been to end these trade disputes that are currently going on in order to open up those markets and make sure that our farmers here in the United States can continue to provide the most healthy and most affordable protein product around the world to consumers. So we are very appreciative that we are included in the Trump administration's trade mitigation package, including a record purchase from USDA of pork products, to serve the most vulnerable in today's society, through food shelters and food banks, but the bottom line is we need those markets open again, so our producers can continue to compete on the international stage.</p><p>NEWTON: How much you there in Washington, how much do you think the administration is listening? Several weeks ago, I spoke to the Agriculture Secretary who just said, \"Look, for you guys, you farmers, this is like a drought or any other piece of adversity you have to put up with.\"</p><p>BAKER: Well, it is certainly true that our producers have to put up with an awful lot of risks out there in the market and I'm confident that the Secretary Perdue over at the USDA, and the Trump administration, for that matter, recognize that our farmers for the most part have been very patient over the last number of months and they've really been patriots, as they have been taking it to the chin in the form of these retaliatory tariffs.</p><p>So hopefully, we have some momentum going in the right direction, as it relates to the USMCA as well as talk about free trade agreements with the Philippines, Japan, the UK, as well as the EU, heading into 2019, and into the new Congress.</p><p>NEWTON: Okay, and trade diversification is certainly will a certainly a good way to go. I will keep eating my bacon. That I can assure you of and we will continue to check in with you especially as we have perhaps some progress on tariffs. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>BAKER: Yes, Happy Thanksgiving to you. Thank you.</p><p>NEWTON: Thank you. European markets moved sharply lower meantime Tuesday, extending the latest wave of global selling. You can see the numbers there, not as bad as what's going on in Wall Street. Tech and bank stocks were the worst performers. The DAX fell the most though.</p><p>Tonight, the Renault board tonight is meeting to decide the future of its CEO, Carlos Ghosn. Nissan is also expected to oust him as Chairman following his shock arrest. New details are emerging about how much company money the auto industry legend allegedly mishandled.</p><p>Ghosn is accused of pocketing millions of dollars destined for other Nissan executives. Prosecutors also say he underreported his income by about $44 million over five years. In France, the Finance Minister says Ghosn has got to go as head of Renault.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNO LE MAIRE, FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER (Through a translator): We need an interim governance, so I will meet this morning, with the appointed administrator, Philippe Lagayette, and the state representatives at the Renault administration board to ask them to immediately set up an interim governance because Mr. Ghosn isn't able to lead the company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Anna Stewart is in London for us. No surprise there that they want to oust him as the head of Renault. Any news on that? We know the board was meeting at this hour.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: So they were due to meet two and a half hours ago. We are expecting fresh lines at any moment now. Of course, the expectation is that he will have to step down as CEO and Chairman given he is under arrest, and his future is looking very uncertain.</p><p>His position at Nissan and Mitsubishi of course, also likely to end rather soon and Nissan CEO proposed he be removed from that board. The Board meeting due on Thursday. Mitsubishi, similar story. So yes, this Renault board meeting is happening now and we wait to hear what happens out of that.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and clearly, probably not too much mystery what's going to happen that. I'm 'm interested to hear though what these companies say they knew and when they knew it as those prosecutors continue to make that case in Japan. Anna Stewart will follow this for us actually throughout the hour.</p><p>[15:25:06]</p><p>NEWTON: So if there's anything new, please come back to us, Anna. Appreciate it. Now, Facebook says it is making strides to clean up its site when a child bride was auctioned off in South Sudan. The post stayed up for a full 15 days and the bidding war ensued before Facebook took it down.</p><p>Hello, I'm Paula Newton, coming up in the next half hour of \"Quest Means Business,\" you will hear from JP Morgan's Chief Global Strategist on how to ride out this market volatility. You'll want to listen to him and another rough day for tech stocks. I will speak to the former US Labor Secretary who says it is time for Facebook to be broken up.</p><p>Before that, though, we now turn to the international headlines. A stunning defense of Saudi Arabia, by US President Donald Trump. Today, he signaled that he will not punish the Kingdom for the killing of journalist and US resident, Jamal Khashoggi. Sources say Mr. Trump's own CIA has concluded the Saudi Crown Prince himself ordered Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>In Afghanistan, officials say at least 50 people are dead after a suicide blast at a celebration marking the Prophet Muhammad's birthday. Scholars have gathered for the occasion at a wedding hall near the Kabul Airport. No group has claimed responsibility.</p><p>Spain's Prime Minister says the country will vote against the United Kingdom's Brexit plan. Pedro Sanchez says the plans don't address future EU regulations, with Gibraltar, a small British territory off the Southern Spanish Coast. Mr. Sanchez says more talks are needed between Spain and the UK.</p><p>And Donald Trump has issued a pardon that all Americans can finally agree on, today the President spared two lucky turkeys that might have otherwise ended up on our Thanksgiving plates. These annual pardons have been a tradition at the White House for decades. Some say back to the time of Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>OK, Facebook is again under fire, this time it's being called a Latter Day Slave Market. It's come to light that a 16-year-old girl in South Sudan was auctioned off -- think about that for a minute, auctioned off for marriage on the site.</p><p>The girl was bid on by five men, and her father reportedly received 500 cows, three cars, and $10,000. David McKenzie has been following the story from Johannesburg.</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Paula, this story has horrified people across the globe. An apparent auction of a young woman in South Sudan on Facebook for marriage. Now, we spoke to a lawyer's group in that country who said that it wasn't in fact, the family itself that put this young girl up for a bidding war on Facebook, but it was community members trying to drive up the price.</p><p>I spoke to the head of Plan International in South Sudan, they've been helping to publicize this awful practice. He said that part of the culture there, that prospective husbands can come in and try and compete of how much dowry they can give to a prospective girl for marriage.</p><p>Now, it's not uncommon for this to happen. More than half of the girls in South Sudan get married under age, before 18, even though technically, it's illegal in that country. Now, Plan International, UNICEF and others say the key to changing this, of course, is that groups like Facebook, if this were to become more prevalent, stop this practice.</p><p>But more importantly, on the ground, to make sure that girls are educated, that they are valued, and they are not bid on like some kind of property. Paula?</p><p>NEWTON: And our thanks to David McKenzie there. Now, Facebook says the sale of a child bride violates its policy against human trafficking. Under community standards, they say the policy is meant to prevent and disrupt real world harm alongside a promise to remove this kind of content.</p><p>Now, they tell us there is a team of 30,000 people around the world working 24/7. The team reviews millions of user reports a week, making decisions about what is allowed. Now there is also a system in place, and to automatically detect content that violates the standards so it can be removed right away, in this instance, the auction was removed a full 15 days after bidding had begun on the 16-year-old girl.</p><p>By that time, as you can imagine, she had already been married off. Samuel Burke is here in London. You know, Samuel, I'm pretty exasperated by all of this, and it's also because, in terms of when you cover countries where child marriages are prevalent, you know what these countries are.</p><p>I can talk to them plain, I can talk to them, anyone who has done these stories on child brides can talk to them. When I say them, I mean Facebook, you've been talking to Facebook, you're with them. Is it really reasonable that this was up for 15 days?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS &amp; TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Of course not. And I think everybody here knows that. And I think more importantly, Paula, investors know that, users know that. Even people within the walls of Facebook know this. As we talked to more and more former Facebook executives, as more and more of them leave, as leadership changes there, we are learning that inside the walls of that company, people are flagging, really, sounding the alarm at every chance they get.</p><p>That it's not just us on the outside criticizing. People inside this company think that the company isn't taking all of these types of issues. Whether it's Russian propaganda or the terrible story at hand here, they're not taking it seriously enough.</p><p>Now, I want to put up on the screen what Facebook has to say about this. Facebook's spokesperson telling us, quote, \"any form of human trafficking, whether post pages, ads or groups is not allowed on Facebook. Remove the post and permanently disable the account belonging to the person who posted this to Facebook.\"</p><p>But Paula, think about this. Fifteen days this was up, you talked about that number, 30,000 moderators -- I just want to contrast that with a different number. Yes, 30,000 moderators, but two-plus billion people. Clearly, it's not enough moderators for the massive amount of users that they have.</p><p>NEWTON: Sam, you've been looking into this and other issues of Facebook, literally, for years. Is the company getting to a point where they think they grasp this, and that they have a solution or is there no solution? They keep acting as if they can do something about it, but really, when it comes down to it, they can't. It is simply for the numbers you just put on screen.</p><p>[15:35:00] BURKE: It's the same story. We can do better, we should do better, we will do better. We will use technology, but I think that there is something bigger happening here. I don't think that this particular story is driving down the price of Facebook today.</p><p>You see on the screen there, the tech market is taking down the stock market at this very moment. But I think, Paula, that there is now a sense, particularly among investors, that enough of these stories have piled up, that they now question whether a platform that can reach almost every human on earth, billions of people.</p><p>So it makes it so the Russians can contact Americans, so that people in a smaller country like South Sudan can maybe get a higher price for their daughter. That maybe the fundamentals of this platform are not going to continue to be popular.</p><p>You have enough of these stories adding up, that really users begin turning on the platform, investors begin turning on the platform. And again, I just want to go back to the fact that we're hearing this from the highest ranks, deep pocket investors and people within the walls of this company really questioning the fundamentals of this platform.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, it will be an interesting debate to come, and as you said, Samuel, so many things to question here, but what can be done, and can it be better? Samuel, thank you for -- very much. We're going to continue this conversation now as Samuel teed up so well for us because former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich says it is time now to break up big tech companies such as Facebook.</p><p>And he's also the author of a book titled \"The Common Good\", he joins me now from Berkeley, California. Mr. Secretary, I've got to tell you, an incredibly provocative point, something that you make, something that Americans really haven't contemplated in decades.</p><p>You want to break up companies like Facebook, and you're saying, while you're at it, throw in Apple, throw in Amazon, throw in Google. What is your argument?</p><p>ROBERT REICH, FORMER LABOR SECRETARY, UNITED STATES: Well, Paula, we haven't seen anything like this since the last decades of the 19th century, in terms of the concentration of economic and political power in these four or five giant high-tech companies.</p><p>And the problem is, and we learned this more than a 100 years ago, but we forgot the lesson. The problem is, when you have this degree of concentrated economic and political power, you are inviting abuses. And the abuses are piling up, and we can see the \"New York Times\" did an expose of Facebook just last week, showing how long Facebook knew about the Russians actually manipulating Facebook in the 2016 election.</p><p>Also that Facebook went to the extraordinary lengths of hiring a political opposition firm to dig up dirt on congressional critics or potential critics of Facebook during the hearings over Facebook. Well, you know, you get to a point where you've got to do two things.</p><p>And in the United States, we have done two things, and we did them in the 20th century, in response to that huge aggregation of economic power. One is regulate, the other is break up big monopolies that have too much power. And those two responses by the public to make sure that these giant companies are comporting with the public interest are the only ways of actually getting them to do so. You can't just trust that they're going to suddenly --</p><p>NEWTON: No --</p><p>REICH: Stop making profits.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, we've learned a lesson that we definitely cannot trust them. I want to distill two of the points. First, you're saying that these companies stifle innovation and that's because big tech sweeping patents, the data, their growing networks actually are dominant platforms and do not encourage innovation.</p><p>And second, you're saying this problem is also political. Too much political power in the hands of the tech companies.</p><p>REICH: Yes, and those are -- those two problems are very similar to the problems we faced in the 1880s, 1890s. That is you have giant railroads and oil companies and steel companies, they were keeping competitors at bay. And what we're seeing now with the giant tech companies is that they are actually stifling innovation because they're keeping smaller companies out of the technology space.</p><p>And secondly, as we saw in the late 19th century, when big companies corrupted politics, these giant companies and Facebook, the expose about Facebook make it very clear, they are funneling huge amounts of money into Washington, they are potentially intimidating legislators with their power --</p><p>NEWTON: Mister --</p><p>REICH: And that kind of power has a very negative political --</p><p>NEWTON: Mr. Secretary --</p><p>REICH: Effect --</p><p>NEWTON: I'm going to hold you right there only because the president is speaking. We're going to listen in.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Florida was a tremendous success with both the Governor Ron DeSantis, he'll be a great governor and the Senator Rick Scott. And as you know, Ohio was a great victory and a lot of great victories.</p><p>[15:40:00] So we're very happy about that. We put out a statement on Saudi Arabia, which I guess most of you have seen, and we'll see how that all works out. It's a very complex situation, it's a shame, but it is what it is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Because it's America first for me, it's all about America first. We're not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars it orders and let Russia, China and everybody else have them. It's all about -- for me, very simple, it's America first. Saudi Arabia, if we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof, I've kept them down, they've helped me keep them down.</p><p>Right now, we have low oil prices or relatively. I'd like to see it go down even lower, but I think that it's a very simple equation for me. I'm about make America great again, and I'm about America first.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you basically telling us, Mr. President, that human rights are too expensive?</p><p>TRUMP: That what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That human rights are too expensive?</p><p>TRUMP: No, I'm not saying that at all. If you look at Iran, just take a look at Iran, and you look at what they're doing, they are a terrorist nation right now, although I must tell you, they're a lot better right now than they were when I took office.</p><p>When I took office, they were heading in a very bad direction. And at some point, things very positive frankly could happen with Iran, but we also need a counter-balance, and Israel needs help also. If we abandon Saudi Arabia, it would be a terrible mistake.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>TRUMP: I really can't understand what you're saying, sorry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The \"Washington Post\" in a statement, put out a statement, they said that you're putting your personal interests, your commercial interests --</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I have nothing to do with -- just so you understand, I don't make deals with Saudi Arabia, I don't have money from Saudi Arabia, I've nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. I couldn't care less, and I will tell you, and as most of you know, being president has cost me a fortune and that's OK with me. I knew that a long time ago.</p><p>But being president has cost me a fortune, a tremendous fortune like you've never seen before, but some day I will tell you what that is, but -- and I knew that a long time ago because I don't do deals. I don't -- all I do is focus on this country and making great deals for this country.</p><p>I don't focus on making great deals for myself because I don't care anymore. So Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with me. What does have to do with me is putting America first.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Wait, they're buying hundreds of billions of dollars worth of things from this country. If I say we don't want to take your business, if I say we're going to cut it off, they will get the equipment, military equipment and other things from Russia and China.</p><p>Russia and China would be very happy because right now, we're doing very well against China, we're doing very well against everybody, including Russia, and I'm going to keep it that way. And I'm not going to tell a country that's spending hundreds of billions of dollars, and has helped me do one thing very importantly, keep oil prices down so that they're not going to $100 and $150 a barrel.</p><p>Right now, we have oil prices in great shape. I'm not going to destroy the world economy, and I'm not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>So I think the statement -- wait a minute, I think the statement was pretty obvious, what I said, it's about America first, yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: Say it again.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why was it appropriate for your daughter's personal e- mail --</p><p>TRUMP: Just so you understand early on, and for a little period of time, Ivanka did some e-mails, they weren't classified like Hillary Clinton, they weren't deleted like Hillary Clinton, who deleted 33 -- she wasn't hiring, she wasn't doing anything to hide her e-mails.</p><p>I looked at it just very briefly today, and the presidential records, they're all in presidential records, there was no hiding. There was no deleting like Hillary Clinton did. There was no service in the basement like Hillary Clinton had. You're talking about a whole different -- you're talking about all fake news.</p><p>So what Ivanka did, it's all in the presidential records, everything is there. There was no deletion, there was no nothing. What it is, is a false story. Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 e-mails, she had a server in the basement, that's the real story.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you still be acting is the fact that your asylum policy has been put on hold.</p><p>TRUMP: Which policy?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your asylum policy has been put on hold.</p><p>TRUMP: Well, you go to the Ninth Circuit and it's a disgrace. And I'm going to put in a major complaint because you cannot win if you're us, a case in the Ninth Circuit.</p><p>[15:45:00] And I think it's a disgrace when people file -- every case gets filed in the Ninth Circuit because they know that's not law, that's not what this country stands for. Every case that gets filed in the Ninth Circuit, we get beaten, and then we end up having to go to the Supreme Court like the travel ban and we won.</p><p>The Ninth Circuit, we're going to have to look at that because every case, no matter where it is, they file it, practically, I mean practically, for all intents and purposes, they file it in what's called the Ninth Circuit. This was an Obama judge.</p><p>And I will tell you what? It's not going to happen like this anymore. Everybody that wants to sue the United States, they file their case in almost -- they file their case in the Ninth Circuit, and it means an automatic loss. No matter what you do, no matter how good your case is, and the Ninth Circuit is really something we have to take a look at because it's not fair.</p><p>People should not be allowed to immediately run to this very friendly circuit and file their case, and you people know better than anybody what's happening, it's a disgrace. In my opinion, it's a disgrace what happens with the Ninth Circuit. We will win that case in the Supreme Court of the United States.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I saw that raid on bin Laden, is he a hero and when (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>TRUMP: Go ahead, what do you have?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Will you answer my question?</p><p>TRUMP: I can't hear your question. I can't hear you, your voice -- your voice is not -- I don't know Admiral -- I don't know Admiral McRaven --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>What?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Robert Mueller.</p><p>TRUMP: But they're all finished. The written answers are finished. I don't know. The lawyers have them. I don't know. They will. They will.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>The written answers to the witch hunt that's been going on forever, no collusion, no nothing. They've been finished, finished them yesterday, the lawyers have them. I assume they'll turn them in today or soon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you afraid to go to a war zone?</p><p>TRUMP: No, I'm going to a war zone, yes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>What?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you happy with the sanctions on Iran?</p><p>TRUMP: Yes, the sanctions on Iran are very strong, very powerful, they're sanctions I think that have had a tremendous impact, more sanctions are going on. We have a lot of tremendous support, and Iran is not the same country it was when I became president.</p><p>It's a much different country, and hopefully, at some point, we'll be able to make a fair deal and help Iran and help the people of Iran.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, do you really believe --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should Julian Assange be able to go free?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I know that Schumer's daughter works for Facebook which I just found out today, and if you look at what Facebook has been doing, you know, they have some real explaining to do, how they're so Democrat- oriented, all of them. But I hear Schumer's daughter works for Facebook and I was very surprised and disappointed to learn that because nobody knew that until now. Yes, go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should Julian Assange go free? (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>TRUMP: I don't know anything about him, really, I don't know much about him. I really don't. Go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you want Pakistan to do?</p><p>TRUMP: Say it --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you want Pakistan to do in the fight against terrorism?</p><p>TRUMP: I want Pakistan to help us. We're no longer paying $1.3 billion to Pakistan, we're paying them nothing because that's what they've done to help us, nothing. And I cut those payments off a long time ago, we're not paying Pakistan any money because they're not helping us at all, and we'll see where it all goes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: I hope to have a good relationship with Pakistan, but right now, we're paying Pakistan nothing. I cut them off. They were getting $1.3 billion a year, they're not getting anything now.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You aren't spending Thanksgiving holiday, Mr. President --</p><p>TRUMP: Oh, you don't worry about Thanksgiving, these are tough people. They know what they're doing and they're great, and they've done a great job. You're so worried about the Thanksgiving holiday for them, they are so proud to be representing our country on the border.</p><p>Where if you look at what's happening, Mexico, the people from Tijuana are saying wow, these are tough people, they're fighting us, they're in fist fights all over the place. These are tough people that are coming in, now I understand they have 500 people that have been designated as let's put it in a nice word, criminals, and these are the people that are coming in.</p><p>No, you don't have people coming in. The order today is not, we can get around that very easily. What I do say, Ninth Circuit is very unfair when everybody files their case in the Ninth Circuit, they file it for a reason. As far as the troops, they are proud to be on the border.</p><p>They are proud to be defending our nation, and we're not letting people in. It's called Catch and Detain. It's not called Catch and Release like it has been for many years.</p><p>[15:50:00] For many years, they called it Catch and Release. They don't call it that anymore. And our soldiers are doing an incredible job, and if you look at the walls that they're building, and if you look at all of the barricades that they're putting up, they've done a great job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you have any reaction to Michael Avenatti being arrested for domestic violence?</p><p>TRUMP: No, I wish him the best of luck. I wish him the best of luck.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What about the markets? Do you agree with Larry Kudlow that we're not headed to a recession?</p><p>TRUMP: No, I think we're doing great. I mean, as a country, we're doing great. Our unemployment is at a record low, you look at all of the different statistics, I think the tech stocks have some problems, but that will come back, but no, I think we're going to do very well.</p><p>I'd like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate. I think the rate's too high, I think we have much more of a Fed problem than we have a problem with anyone else. We're doing very well with China, China wants to make a deal very badly. They might not say that to you, but they want to make it very badly.</p><p>I have another $250 billion worth of tariffs to put on, if we don't make a deal, and believe me, I will be putting them on. Because China has been ripping off our country for many years. And they don't rip us off with me. We made a great deal with Canada, we made a great deal with Mexico, I appreciate the help that Mexico is giving us at the border.</p><p>You see that people are not coming through, all of the fist-fights and the fighting that you see are done on the Mexico side. They're not coming in here, but I appreciate what Mexico is doing. They can do more, but I appreciate what they're doing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How can you say for sure that all of Ivanka's e-mails were preserved. Find the server --</p><p>TRUMP: Well, they were preserved. The lawyer told me they're all preserved. Historically, they're preserved.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Trump, what about the CIA assessing the company (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>TRUMP: They didn't make a determination. And it's just like I said, I think it was very -- maybe he did, maybe he didn't. They did not make that assessment. The CIA has looked at it, they've studied it a lot, they have nothing definitive. And the fact is maybe he did, maybe he didn't.</p><p>If you look at Iran, what they've done, they've been a bad actor, you look at what's happening in Syria with Assad, with hundreds of thousands of people killed -- we are with Saudi Arabia, we're staying with Saudi Arabia. And by the way, just so everybody -- I have no business whatsoever with Saudi Arabia. Couldn't care less.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are the Saudis to be blamed for the murder?</p><p>TRUMP: No, this is about America first, they're paying us $400 billion- plus to purchase and invest in our country. That's probably the biggest amount ever paid to the United States. This is over a long period of time, it means hundreds of thousands of jobs, billions of dollars of investment and product.</p><p>And if you think I'm going to let Russia have that money or those things -- if you think I'm going to let China make the military equipment -- hey, China and Russia would love to make $100 billion worth of military equipment from Saudi Arabia.</p><p>We have the contracts. They wanted those contracts. That would be a big, fat beautiful gift to Russia and to China. They're not going to get that gift. Just so you understand, it's about make America great again, it's about America first.</p><p>We're going to stay with Saudi Arabia. The other thing, Saudi Arabia is probably the second biggest oil producer. They've worked with us very well, we've kept oil prices down. If you want to see oil prices go to $150 a barrel, like by the way, Russia would love to see that, all you have to do is break up our relationship with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>What?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you mean what the Saudi Consulate did was more --</p><p>TRUMP: I don't know that he's going to be there, but if he is, I would.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cindy Hyde, are you concerned about or --</p><p>TRUMP: So Cindy Hyde-Smith is a spectacular woman. She's a great senator. She came in, she's done a fantastic job in a short period of time. She made a statement which I know that she feels very badly about it, and it was just sort of said in jest, as she said, and she's a tremendous woman.</p><p>And it's a shame that she has to go through this. I think she's going to do very well, I really believe she's going to do very well. I've gotten to know her well, she is a person that loves the people of Mississippi. She loves the people of this country.</p><p>She is going to be a great senator -- I'm going to do two events in Mississippi on Monday. I'm doing one near -- let's see, I'm doing one near Jackson and I'm doing one in the Gulf Coast, and we're going to do one in Tupelo, so we might even do three, but we're going to do two.</p><p>[15:55:00] I think Tupelo probably is definite, and I think Gulfport is definite. Cindy Hyde-Smith is a tremendous woman who truly loves the people of Mississippi and our country.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Were you ever --</p><p>TRUMP: And I think -- and I think she is going to win third day.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why don't you ever allow Ivanka be interviewed by a Democrat about the e-mails?</p><p>TRUMP: Oh, Ivanka can handle herself. Ivanka can handle herself. These are all in the historical records, there was no deletion whatsoever. Unlike Hillary Clinton who deleted 33,000 e-mails. Unlike Hillary Clinton, who had a server in the basement, Ivanka didn't.</p><p>This was just early on when she came in. These calls were not classified, unlike Hillary Clinton's calls which were classified, and it's all fake news.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>I love the pardons for the turkey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>I have a daughter, but not --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You shouldn't follow -- you shouldn't follow Assad, why are still supporting his position?</p><p>TRUMP: No, I think what Assad has done is horrible. I mean, really horrible.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A question about reaching the online polls, would you feel, obviously, I can assume who do you think deserves first place, who do you think deserves the second place?</p><p>TRUMP: It's called person of the year, right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: It's no longer man of the year, right? I don't know, that's up to \"Time Magazine\". I've been there before, I can't imagine anybody else other than Trump. Can you imagine anybody other than Trump? Have a good time, everybody, thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018112001cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSR-BMR1-JB20-G52V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9069\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Thank you so much. And we are on. And good morning to you, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, November 30th. Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All eyes on Buenos Aires this morning and the G20 meeting. President Trump meeting with the President of Argentina this morning already. Next hour, he will sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, that's USMCA, with the leaders of Mexico and Canada. We're going to take you there live when the signing happens. The focus, of course, is on trade. And at the President's Dinner with China's President Xi Jinping, President Trump says he's open to a deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think we're very close to doing something with China, but I don't know that I want to do it because what we have right now is billions and billions of dollars coming into the United States in the form of tariffs or taxes, so I really don't know. But I will tell you that I think China wants to make a deal. I'm open to making a deal. But frankly, I like the deal we have right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Markets this morning expected to open lower. Take a look at futures indicating a decline in the triple digits on the Dow Industrials, down about a hundred points on the Dow, one-half of one percent. Down 12 points on the S&amp;P 500, down 30 points on the NASDAQ right now. This, after stocks edged lower yesterday, erasing gains in final hour of trading. It was a wild one at the end of the day there.</p><p>Down 27 points at the close on the Dow, down six on the S&amp;P 500 and down 18 on the NASDAQ yesterday. It is the last trading day of the month. It has been a mixed month; the Dow and the S&amp;P are on track for gains for the month with the NASDAQ down half of one percent for the month of November.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we're seeing a similar story. Declines across the board, FT-100 down 50 points, three quarters of one percent, CAC Quarante down 25, half a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany down two-thirds of one percent, 73 points lower. In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, actually, with the exception of Korea. Best performer was China, up almost one percent on the Shanghai Composite.</p><p>Well, there is chaos on the border, a high-speed chase with Border Patrol in California ends in a deadly crash. We have the very latest coming up this morning. And a harrowing escape from the California wildfire, new video in this morning from a body camera showing the desperate moments an officer thought he may not make it out of that blaze.</p><p>Staying in detention, Carlos Ghosn will reportedly be held for an additional 10 days after a ruling from a Japanese court. We've got the very latest there. Plus, Steph curry's response, the Warriors star responding to a nine-year-old's request to make his popular shoes available for girls, not just boys. The heartwarming story coming up later this hour. All those stories coming up this Friday.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The King's College Professor of Business and Economics, Brian Brenberg, and Independent Women's Voice CEO, Heather Higgins. Good to see you this morning.</p><p>HEATHER HIGGINS, CEO, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE: It's nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMICS, THE KING'S COLLEGE: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Morning.</p><p>BRENBERG: Can't think of a better place to be in a morning like this, so much big news coming out of Buenos Aires. We'll see what happens. I think it's big question marks all around now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a lot of fast-moving news this morning out of the G20. The President's waiting for these meetings, first Argentina, and then of course China, Dagen, which is going to be the big one.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. And I -- there's really no way to know what kind of good news just this market need to see because, again, there's that front page story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that looking to try and defuse tensions and boost the markets, that it's possible we're looking at a trade deal to hold off on further tariffs through the spring in exchange for new broad talks based on --</p><p>They want to look at a kind of widespread trade architecture with China, but, again, President Trump seemed today indicate earlier in the week that a 10 percent to 25 percent increase in the existing tariffs with China is still in play.</p><p>BRENBERG: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it's unlikely to be postponed, so there've been a lot of mixed signals --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- coming out based on reporting in the markets.</p><p>HIGGINS: But it has to be still in play because there's no way the Chinese are going to come to the table if he takes it off before there's a deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HIGGINS: All right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he's negotiating something (INAUDIBLE) we know what.</p><p>HIGGINS: He's negotiating at all times.</p><p>BRENBERG: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. But it -- so they -- they're negotiating, but it remains to be seen how good does the good news need to be in order to move these markets higher because we had that incredible jump in the market -- not yesterday, day before yesterday, because of the Jay Powell speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HIGGINS: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're talking about that 600-point --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- move in the Dow the other day. We got a lot coming up this morning. Joining the conversation this morning is the Founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, is here with us this morning in studio. Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Honduras, Mexico, and the Philippines, and Former Deputy Secretary of State, John Negroponte, will be here as well to talk G20.</p><p>California Congressman and House Armed Services Committee Member, John Garamendi, is here with us again. And Rocco Forte, hotels Chairman and Catholic Herald's owner, Sir Rocco Forte stopping by as well. A lot to come in these three hours. Don't miss a moment of it. We kick it off here with our top story.</p><p>And that is President Trump on the world stage. The Commander-in-Chief arriving in Buenos Aires last night for Annual G20 Summit. His arrival coming amid rising tensions, as he prepares to sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a crucial dinner in hopes of settling the trade differences.</p><p>World leaders will begin gathering for the Summit in just over two hours from now. Next hour, we are expected to hear from President Trump, as he signs the USMCA trade pact, alongside Mexican President Pe\u00a4a Nieto, and Canadian President Justin Trudeau. We will take you there when that signage begins.</p><p>Joining us right now from Buenos Aires live is the \"COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL\" Anchor, Liz Claman. She'll be doing her show there live. Liz, good morning to you. What can you tell us?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. We are here at the Park Hyatt in the room where it will happen, so to speak, the signing of U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, all three leaders will be here in just about an hour or two, put pen to paper, but the word is that we are hearing there was haggling late into the night, still a bit of horse- trading and the ink wasn't even yet dry.</p><p>So, it will be a very interesting moment to see the expressions, to see the perception of what we have behind us, and that is the desk where both President Trump, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Mexico's President Pe\u00a4a Nieto, is going to be there. And, you know what, there was a -- supposedly a side letter agreement that would show a preserve the right to impose 25 percent global tariffs on auto, so that would give the U.S. a little bit of an upper hand. And we also got, according to the reports, more of an open area for access to the Canadian dairy market.</p><p>So what we're looking at here is a lot of energy and a lot of buzziness about the signing and it sort of kicks off the big G20 moment. However, President Trump, who will stand right there, already had a very early morning breakfast with Mauricio Macri, the President of Argentina, and, you know, it's more than just the signing of the USMCA or that big meeting tomorrow night with China's Xi Jinping. Here's the President this morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're going to be talking about lots of good things for Argentina, and for the United States, including trade, including military purchases, and other things, but we have a lot to talk about, a little bit old times, about 95 percent business, I would say.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAMAN: But this morning, you will see leadership come together to sign that USMCA deal, also known as NAFTA 2.0. Boy, Maria, it has really been a long road coming here. Back during the candidacy, President Trump said he we wanted to rip it up, or that it needed to be modernized. The tweaks, according to all of the reports, are rather small, but we won't know exactly what's in it. Whether we will see the dropping of the tariffs on the Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum because those two countries really wanted to see that.</p><p>And watch the markets, Maria, that's what'll really tell you if the markets and stocks liked this deal. 3:00 p.m. Eastern, I'm live from Buenos Aires for \"COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL\" and that's when we spin it forward to the big meeting between China and the U.S. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Liz. We'll be watching. Thanks so much. Liz Claman is live in Buenos Aires this morning. Your expectations for the Summit, Brian Brenberg.</p><p>BRENBERG: Well, it's interesting that they're going to be signing the USMCA. Remember, just a day or two before that deal came together, the word on the street was the President's not going to do it, he's very mad at Trudeau, lo and behold, the deal happens. We're in the same situation with China here. Who knows where it's going to go? People are saying he doesn't want to do a deal, people are saying he does want to do a deal. The fact iu only he knows and we'll only find out when he speaks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, we got to see --</p><p>BRENBERG: But the question mark are big --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- what China's going to do, right? I mean -- I mean we're in the same place, unless we see a change in China's behavior.</p><p>BRENBERG: And I don't think he's not in any hurry to take away some of the tools he has in his tool belt, especially the $200 billion in tariffs that could go to 25 percent January 1.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, China, according to \"The Journal\" that President Xi has been pressing for a deal. He is worried that the economy in China could be impacted even more with growing at just six and -- just six and a half percent in the third quarter of this year, but I -- but it's still -- you do have these warring factions within the White House.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That you have a Larry Kudlow who is worried about heightened -- increasing trade tensions, even trade tensions where they are hurting the economy and the stock market. And President Trump clearly looks at the stock market as a barometer of his popular support. He used to tweet about it and quote --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- about it when it was hitting one record after another. And then you have Bob Lighthizer, the trade -- the Chief of Trade in the White House who has a very different position. I just want to point out, when we talk about a truce --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- that we got a truce, remember, back in May of this year with Steve Mnuchin saying the U.S. is putting a trade war on hold while the two sides will not assess tariffs on one another as talks continue. Well, we got tariffs --</p><p>BRENBERG: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- on $200 billion with the Chinese import, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We sure do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- President Trump and say Bob Lighthizer won over Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't think that's anything priced into the market in terms of a positive. So, I mean anything that --</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is appearing to be positive, I think, would be a positive upside surprise. What do you think, Heather?</p><p>HIGGINS: Well, I think that you've got markets that are always trying to look for tealeaves and Trump is always the source of drama, which makes for much more exciting story. But the reality is, is that what really matters is what the fed does. And we now know that Powell seems to be more sensitive to what the markets are doing,</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS: -- then he may have been before as much as he is data driven. So, if something doesn't happen with China, and remember, there's this tension. You now have Navarro going to the meeting and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS: -- Navarro is very much of the school that agendas and architectures mean more China traps of endless discussions that never actually lead to deals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. We have -- we have the President tweeting from Argentina this morning about the meeting he canceled with the President of Russia, he canceled the meeting with Vladimir Putin. He says, \"Oh, I get it, I am a very good developer, happily living my life when I see our country going in the wrong direction, to put it mildly. Against all odds, I decide to run for President and continue to run my business, very legal and very cool, talked about it in campaign trail. Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia, but put up zero money and zero guaranties and didn't do the project. Witch hunt.</p><p>So, once again, he's referring to the Mueller probe, and Michael Cohen's guilty plea about lying. He's a real estate developer, Heather. Do you see anything here in terms of him considering putting a building in Russia and deciding against it?</p><p>HIGGINS: Last I checked, investing in Russia is legal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HIGGINS: Discussing investing in Russia is legal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is legal, yes.</p><p>HIGGINS: The crimes for which people have been indicted by Mueller are things like the timing of the recollection that they had. The Russians who were brought to heel were not for crimes having nothing to do with Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>HIGGINS: There is a -- this is something that ought to concern everyone, is what happens when you have the unbridled power of a Special Prosecutor trying to ring a -- at the -- at the threat of peril of extraordinarily disproportionate sentences, some sort of information that advances their political agenda.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, anything that -- anything that says anything about Russia is sort of --</p><p>HIGGINS: Can we call him Anthrax Bob? Because he is so revered, this is the man who, for 5 years, pursued somebody who clearly was not the cause of anthrax and wasted all of these taxpayer money on an investigation, bob</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) Robert Mueller, Anthrax Bob.</p><p>HIGGINS: Anthrax Bob. Oh my God.</p><p>BRENBERG: You could test that one out and see how it goes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, let's not, you know, let's not forget what happens when you have no checks on prosecutorial discretion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a fair point, Heather.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but Bob Mueller is there in part because of mistakes that the Trump administration made, by putting Jeff Sessions as the Head of the Department of Justice --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and not knowing he was going to recuse himself. So, there's a lot of blame to go around about what Bob Mueller's there in the first place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. All right. We'll take a short break. When we come back, deadly crash near the California border, we've got the latest. A pickup truck flipping after a high-speed chase with Border Patrol agents, the story is next. Then remaining in jail, a Japanese court reportedly approving an extension on Carlos Ghosn's detention, he will be there up to 60 days. We've got the fallout, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, a high-speed chase near the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego turned deadly. Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. Police say a Chevy Pickup attempted to flee an enforcement stop. It had a spike strip and it rolled into an embankment. This happened on I-8, Southern California, the pickup carrying 11 people, three of them were killed, the other eight were injured. The driver was speeding at more than a hundred miles per hour.</p><p>As they went through traffic, he's believed to be a U.S. citizen and is now in Border Patrol custody, not immediately at this point where the passengers were part of the migrant caravan, currently awaiting entry into the United States. Or if they were legal or illegal in general. So, we're trying to get more details in the story this morning.</p><p>Also this, a deputy, U.S. Marshal shot and killed while trying to serve a warrant. The suspect, Ryan Schlesinger, shooting the officer while barricaded inside a home in Tucson, Arizona, listen to the tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my God.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get over here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get behind the car. Hurry up, go. Go inside.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some frightening moments there. Schlesinger eventually surrendered. He was already wanted for stalking law enforcement. The name of the Deputy Marshal has not been released as of yet.</p><p>And then there's this, the Japanese Court has reportedly extended the detention of Former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn for 10 more days without charge. Prosecutors requested the extension to have more time to investigate his alleged financial misconduct. Nissan ousted Ghosn as its Chairman following his arrest on November 19. Shares of Nissan down 14 percent so far this year. So, Maria, he's still in custody.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know how I feel about this, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think this is just extraordinary that -- I don't understand this Japanese Judiciary System, holding somebody, Brian Brenberg when you don't even have the charge. They say that they're going to keep him another 10 days as they decide what to charge him with.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes. He's had very limited access to lawyers, there's absolutely no transparency, and we don't really know the details, which is one thing. But the fact is he hasn't even been charged yet.</p><p>HIGGINS: Terrible.</p><p>BRENBERG: How in the world are you holding him for this period of time?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we know that there was a movement within Nissan to take him down because they do not want to be acquired by a French company.</p><p>BRENBERG: They do not like this deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the Japanese government doesn't want a French company acquiring one of its jewels, Nissan.</p><p>BRENBERG: But this, there's no transparency here and this looks like a lot of backroom dealing to set somebody up and now detain him with no end? I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is a guy who was an icon at one point, a comic book character named after him. What do you think about this?</p><p>HIGGINS: I think he should have been Japanese, because obviously not being Japanese in Japan is really not helping him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. But they loved it when Nissan was almost bankrupt and he came in and rescued the company.</p><p>BRENBERG: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But now, clearly, they're treating him quite differently.</p><p>HIGGINS: It's kind of a \"what have you done for me lately\" deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, they obviously won't -- trying to prevent him from leaving the country, that they see him as a flight risk because he's a Brazilian citizen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>BRENBERG: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But he lives in places around the world, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he's French citizen as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it's a -- but it's a violation of what we consider to be someone's rights to jail someone, detain someone just to investigate alleged activity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alleged activity --</p><p>BRENBERG: We're going to out if anything's wrong, but in the meantime, you stay here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's terrible. It's terrible. And apparently, he's been told, \"You can't speak to your family, you're sleeping on the floor on a cot, you're going to eat porridge.\" I mean it's just -- it's just been horrible. I mean it's totally foreign to us live -- in America.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We might expect it from --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Russia?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, or --</p><p>HIGGINS: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even China?</p><p>HIGGINS: Even China. But now Japan.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By Japan who call themselves capitalists --</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) I don't think so. Really unfortunate. We'll keep following that. Coming up, incredible video from a California Deputy's body camera as he navigated through most destructive wild fire in the State's history. Then slashing jobs, Bayer's plans to cut workers and shed iconic brands like Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's, we'll tell you about it, back in a moment right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now to the battle at the border, Tijuana's Mayor taking aim at the organizers of the migrant caravan, saying that he's never seen a situation like this. FOX News' Griff Jenkins joins us live from Tijuana, Mexico, with the very latest. Griff, good morning to you.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. Yes, Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum calls this a humanitarian crisis. And just look behind me in the last 24 hours. We've had torrential downpours in the '50s. They're soaking clothes. Tarps over tens. But look at this shot, because we're outside of this 6,000 strong (INAUDIBLE) but if you look in there, the weather has just destroyed it. On top of that, they're suffering from over 60 percent have infections. There's cases of TB, chickenpox, it's infestations of lice, HIV/AIDS cases.</p><p>But, you know, when Gastelum talks about who he blames for it, he says the organizers are truly criminals, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN MANUEL GASTELUM, MAYOR OF TIJUANA, MEXICO: They're dealing with lives, they're dealing with people. It's a federal crime. If you -- they ask me, \"Do you know who they are?\" \"No, I don't know, but just look at the films. Look at them and you'll find who are they.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS: And when he talks about films, part of that is referring to Sunday's mayhem when the migrants rushed the border and he talked about the impact that it had financially on the people of Tijuana, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GASTELUM: People from San Diego cross the border to work in Tijuana, people from Tijuana cross the border to work in the United States, and those six hours that the border was closed. We lost about approximately a hundred and twenty-nine million pesos. That's not fair. So, how do you think people from Tijuana feel towards those people who are making problems?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS: Hundred twenty-nine million pesos is over six million U.S. dollars. The mayor worries that they'll another rush like that. And he also is footing the bill for this at $30,000 a day and he says he can't do it past this weekend. He's going to need federal help, so far he's got en none, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. Thirty thousand dollars a day because there's all of this sickness as well, Griff.</p><p>JENKINS: That's right. And the Tijuana people are worried about that in fact they want to help these migrants. The Mayor says, \"This is a migrant town,\" but at the end day, unless there's new President who will be inaugurated tomorrow steps in with federal funds, he is in a real difficult spot. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll keep following, Griff. Thank you. Griff Jenkins on the ground there in Tijuana. Coming up, crypto crime, Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled hit with huge fines over not disclosing payments to promote cryptocurrencies. Got those details next up. Then the smell of fear -- one production company offering movie genre scented candles, like western and horror. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is, Friday, November 30th. Your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. The G20 summit is on. President Trump meeting with the President of Argentina this morning in Buenos Aires. He is set to sign the USMCA deal. That is the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement. He will sign that coming up with the leaders of Mexico and Canada.</p><p>The real focus, of course, on this trip is trade at the President's highly anticipated dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Markets this morning are lower. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading of about a hundred and twenty points. That's down one-half of one percent. S&amp;P is also down, one-half of a percent as is the NASDAQ. Thirty-two points lower on NASDAQ.</p><p>This after the major indices closed marginally lower yesterday. Take a look. Dow Industrials down a fraction, 27 points, as was the S&amp;P 500 down six points, quarter of a percent. NASDAQ was down 18, another quarter of a percent lower on the NASDAQ. The Dow, the S&amp;P, and the NASDAQ still on track to finish the week higher.</p><p>In Europe this morning, similar story, take a look at the indices in European markets today, down across the board, FT-100 down two-thirds of a percent, 48 points lower. CAC Quarante in Paris down a half a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, 69 points lower, two-thirds of one percent, lower.</p><p>Asian markets, meanwhile, closed mostly higher, overnight, as you can see there.</p><p>The very latest on the California wildfires, this morning, including authorities ending their search for remains, in Paradise, and incredible body cam footage just released, of a deputy, in the middle of the Camp Fire. We will bring it to you, coming up.</p><p>Meanwhile, breaking news this morning, a beach -- a breach, rather, at Marriot, the hotel chain reporting a security incident with the guest registration database, for its Starwood chain, Marriott says that there has been unauthorized access to that database, going back to 2014. Marriott shares are down, this morning. We've got more on that, coming up.</p><p>Plus, crypto trouble, why boxer, Floyd Mayweather and D.J. Khaled are in hot water, this morning, over their crypto currency dealings.</p><p>And a kick in the right direction, basketball star, Stephen Curry's response to a 9-year-old girl, wanting to know why his sneakers are only sold to boys, he responds.</p><p>All those stories coming up, this Friday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, the G20 summit is on, President Trump holding a breakfast bilateral meeting this morning, with the president of Argentina.</p><p>In roughly, 30 minutes time, the President will sign the USMCA deal. The leaders of Mexico and Canada will be with him to sign that deal, joining us right now, Former Trump Presidential Campaign Communications Director, Bryan Lanza, along with Former Press Secretary for House Democrats, Rochelle Richie, good to see you both, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY FOR HOUSE DEMOCRATS: Good morning.</p><p>BRYAN LANZA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MERCURY: Good morning. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bryan, let me kick it off with you here, this deal is important, the Mexico-Canada deal, but we'll watch them sign it, but then, it has to be ratified by Congress, in the New Year. Do you see any impediments to this deal, closing?</p><p>LANZA: Yes, a Democratic House. You know, it's partisan politics, I think you look at the Democratic Party who spent the last two years trying to derail this economy. They now have a foothold on the government that actually gives them more opportunities to do that.</p><p>So, the uncertainty of, you know, however long the votes take, the more criticism that comes through it, just because of partisan politics, I think that sort of -- that sort of tries to rock to this agreement. But I expect a feverish pushback from the administration, because this is a great achievement for the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LANZA: I mean, let's remember, nobody said. Everybody said this was not possible, and the President, along with Jared, proved to the American people that an outside perspective, you know, a sort of business approach, rather the typical political approach, can resolve problems.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rochelle, what do you think about that? Are we going to see the next two years of just fighting back and forth, just because the Democrats don't want to agree with President Trump, even though we know that the U.S. is in a better position in this deal versus NAFTA?</p><p>RITCHIE: Well, look, I think we're going to see a lot of fighting, regardless in the next two years, but I think this is a win for the President. I mean, he also said that he was willing to rip up the NAFTA deal, if we all recall that, but now, he is signing it. And I think, it is a step in the right direction.</p><p>Obviously, there is going to be some mudslinging, as we head into January, with the Democrats, controlling the House. And it'll be interesting to see exactly what happens there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the real mudslinging is going to come over this Russia investigation, right?</p><p>RITCHIE: Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got new developments this morning, President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, is pleading guilty, to lying to Congress about President Trump's business dealings in Russia.</p><p>Cohen said he tried to downplay, then-candidate Trump's involvement in building a project in Moscow, during the 2016 election. Here's what the President had to say about those claims.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: He's a week person and what he's trying to do is get a reduced sentence. So he's lying about a project that everybody knew about. I mean, we were very open with it. We were thinking about building a building. I guess we had (INAUDIBLE) it was an option.</p><p>I don't know what you would call it. We decided -- I decided ultimately not to do it. There would've been nothing wrong if I did do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rochelle, your reaction to this?</p><p>RITCHIE: Well, look, all of the President's men are being exposed for the liars that they are, and Michael Cohen is included in that. And I think it's just a matter of time before all of them turn on President Trump.</p><p>And the fact that Mueller has 70 hours of additional testimony, really should concern the President, right now. And I just think that with Michael Cohen and all the President's men, as I mentioned, I think that this is going to really expose the fact that there was collusion between the President and Russia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rochelle, where's the collusion? This is something that we've been covering for a year, and we know that there's absolutely no evidence - -</p><p>RITCHIE: We don't know because the investigation isn't done yet, so how do we know there's no collusion, because the President said so?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's been going on for two years, where do you see collusion exactly, then?</p><p>RITCHIE: Well, I think that there's collusion when you think about the fact that he was dealing with Russia at that time, he did not expose that. And also the fact that we haven't seen --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITCHIE: He does build buildings all around the world, but why hasn't he released his tax returns to prove that he has not dealt with Russia in that capacity? I don't understand --</p><p>LANZA: Here we go again.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes, here we go again. I mean, this is your president, so here we go again.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's try to have credibility here and just speak facts. Go ahead, Bryan.</p><p>LANZA: Yes. First of all, let's talk about tax returns. The American people don't care about the tax returns.</p><p>RITCHIE: I care.</p><p>LANZA: Oh, you're one of them, but the vast majority --</p><p>RITCHIE: One of many.</p><p>LANZA: elected him for president, said they didn't care. They actually cared about the guidance and the separate ship of this economy, going forward. And so, when we look at, you know, what Michael Cohen -- you know, Michael Cohen sense a Michael Cohen sense. Paul Manafort sense a Paul Manafort sense.</p><p>At the end of the day, this investigation has been going on for over two years. Let's remember, it started a lot sooner than we all knew about. And there is yet to be a determination of an actual crime that took place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>RITCHIE: I don't understand why --</p><p>LANZA: There seems like there is an investigation -- seems like there's an investigation to find the crime (INAUDIBLE) opposition research --</p><p>RITCHIE: I really don't understand why there's such this rush with Mueller's investigation. I mean, when we look what happened with Watergate --</p><p>LANZA: What's the crime?</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the rush?</p><p>RITCHIE: We're figuring that out once the investigation happens.</p><p>LANZA: That's not how investigation works.</p><p>RITCHIE: Let the investigation happen. This is how it works.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The investigation is happening, Rochelle, it's ongoing -- it's ongoing.</p><p>RITCHIE: Right. But everyone saying, oh, there's no collusion, we don't even know that yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we do.</p><p>RITCHIE: No, we don't.</p><p>LANZA: Rochelle, there's speculation about what might be in the 70 hours and there's public evidence of conspiracy. We've got a lot of speculation. We've got basically nothing when it comes to public evidence of conspiracy.</p><p>Yes, but the speculation is being treated as evidence of collusion. You cannot make that bridge until you have some public evidence. Can you not at least admit --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LANZA: It is.</p><p>RITCHIE: OK. But we still don't know if there's not any collusion. We don't know that. We do not know that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Michael Cohen filing, specifically, let's get the facts straight, it says if there's no impeachable evidence in it and there is hardly a crime. It says Michael Cohen looked at a hotel deal in Moscow, for 6 months, in 2016.</p><p>Russians with ties to the kremlin, wanting to get Mr. Trump to visit Russia and meet Mr. Putin, the deal fell through, Trump never made the trip. That's what we know from the filing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What we also know is that Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier. Do you want to see that investigated, because we know that for a fact?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITCHIE: I think that -- for what? I'm an independent, so yes, investigate her too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>RITCHIE: Investigate all of them. That's how I really feel. I am not a Democrat, for one. I'm an independent register. And so, when I see these things happening on both sides of the aisle, both sides should be held accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: But what I'm not going to do is sit here and say that something did not happen when there's an investigation still going on. And maybe Mueller is not laying all of his cards out on the table just yet. We don't know. We really don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I would say, based on all the leaks, if there was collusion, it would've been leaked a long time ago.</p><p>LANZA: Yes. Adam, he's representing the Schiff, would've leaked it last year and that guy's going to leak everything. And nothing has come out. There's no collusion, guys.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The fact that there was -- the report has all in all likely have been drafted, and that there has been no leaks of anything damning, coming out of it. It's pretty indicative that there isn't any there, there.</p><p>There's going to be a little bit that people will try to spin, but there's a difference between a legal standard and what somebody did, politically. Most of these are political actors, who had lousy reputations, because they're political actors. This is not the high ethics floor, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Alan Dershowitz was alluding to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He could be a political disaster for the President but not criminal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And I don't think it will be a political disaster because --</p><p>RITCHIE: I know that a lot of people look at this, like, well, you know, they're looking at this as an opportunity to impeach the President. Well, even if he is impeached, he's still going to be in the White House. I mean, Bill Clinton was impeached and he was still there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, not by the Senate, by the House, but not by the Senate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LANZA: Let's distract this just because we can. I mean, the President has a country to run.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick, we've got to jump. Bryan Lanza.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He is the leader of the free world, why are we -- just throw the investigation because we can, because why not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you, guys. Bryan Lanza, Rochelle Ritchie, thank you so much. Stay with us all morning as we cover more from the G20 in Argentina. We'll take you live to President Trump signing the USMCA deal with Mexico and Canada, top of the hour, back in a moment.</p><p>First though, in case you missed it, it was a busy week here, certainly, with the top moments from the program right here, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS: It was nothing extraordinary, he said. He was just acknowledging that by now, after several rate hikes over two or three years, the Fed is close to neutral. Clearly, there's going to be some head winds for the next year economy.</p><p>There's clearly going to be some head winds from, you know, the effects of the tax reductions in fiscal reports in U.S. are starting to ban. Market gross is going to be more normalized but, there's no reason to worry. I don't see an imminent recession on the horizon.</p><p>JOHN KOUDOUNIS, CEO, CALAMOS INVESTMENTS: They're saying that they might do another three interest rate hikes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're not buying that?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS: I'm not buying that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're not buying.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS: I think they will be accommodated.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Has there been any conversation in terms of Academia and what Academia can do in terms of China, and Chinese students coming here, going to our universities and taking the best of the best, back to China.</p><p>BETSY DEVOS, SECRETARY OF EDUCATION: Well, I think that's an issue that we have to have a lot further conversation about. It's good to have international exchanges. I think that's important for our students from America and for students around the world.</p><p>But I think we need to also do it with our eyes wide open about the potential for abuses in that -- in that -- in that regard.</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA: The impact is going to certainly hurt U.S. consumers because these are not going to be as targeted as the first $250 billion. But the point is, the Chinese are probably not going to cave in on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What you think might get accomplished at the G20 in the next couple days, are you optimistic about a deal with China?</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN: What I think is important, do a sit-down and have a face to face conversation about what are we doing in regard to trade, and let's be clear, Donald Trump doesn't impose tariffs because he's trying to protect the American worker or the American economy.</p><p>He's doing it because he wants trade barriers to go away, because if we have a fair playing field, we, and he knows that the American worker and American business will thrive and grow.</p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA: Russia, really, in my opinion, doesn't owe any claim to that land and shouldn't be defending who we decide our ally is, and it shouldn't be decidedly Ukraine, in this instance.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R), TEXAS: People are getting hurt because they feel that this fence is something they can slide through and achieve their goal, that the wall needs to be there as a matter of public safety.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you want to see happen within big tech?</p><p>MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), SENATOR-ELECT, TENNESSEE: What I would like to see happen, is passage of the browse (INAUDIBLE) which is privacy regulation to put to one template in place for the entire ecosystem, whether it is your internet service provider, which is your ISP, or it is one of the edge providers.</p><p>BILL RUDIN, CO-CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, RUDIN MANAGEMENT: Submitted along with the city, to try to get them to go to Brooklyn. But we are very happy that they've decided to go to Long Island City.</p><p>ROGERS HEALY, REAL ESTATE OWNER, ROGERS HEALY &amp; ASSOCIATION: It has (INAUDIBLE) a little bit before interest rates to get closer to five percent. It's more expensive for the house, the person thought they could afford, now, they really can't. So, you know, that has definitely slowed us down, but the market is still fine.</p><p>JOHN PAUL DEJORIA, CO-FOUNDER, JOHN PAUL MITCHELL: I like to start a business, why not change the dynamics? First thing we did was before it was sold, we gave away free to homeless veterans that were on the street.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How do you figure out what satisfies you? What rewards you? For me, it's working with somebody brilliant, harder working than anyone I've ever known.</p><p>KEN COLEMAN, HOST, THE KEN COLEMAN SHOW: I can use my talent to develop skills and use those to do work that gives me great meaning. This is what people are looking for. And when you step into that role, it really -- it really will be a dream job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the wildfires are out, thankfully, but California is now facing dangerous flooding with possible mudslides. Cheryl Casone with the headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's the concern, Maria. Heavy rain is expected in cities like Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and Sacramento. Mandatory evacuations already have been issued for people living near where the holy fire broke out because of the potential for flooding and as you said, Maria, mudslides. Well, those in Malibu, near the Woolsey Fire, also had been put on alert for potential evacuation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the search for bodies in the town of Paradise has come to an end. Authorities say, they have now looked everywhere that they can for identifiable remains. They expect to reopen parts of the town. The death toll stands right now at 88.</p><p>Then, this incredible body cam video shared by a sheriff, attempting to rescue four nurses during the campfire in Paradise. Aaron Parmley's car broke down forcing him to get on foot, he turned on his body camera to capture what he thought would be his dying moments. Parmley eventually found those nurses he was able to luckily escape that fire.</p><p>Well, Marriott International has disclosed a major data breach saying its Starwood guest reservation database was targeted. This incident which Marriott discovered on November 19th potentially exposed information on about 500 million people, that included names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, e-mails and in some instances, passport numbers. Marriott is taking steps to address the issue. Shares of Marriott are lower in the pre-market, down more than 5-1/2 percent, that new breaking this morning.</p><p>Finally, Christmas candles are always popular at this time of year. Who doesn't love the smell of a pine tree but how about the smell of a horror movie? H24 is releasing a series of cinema scented candles based on genres like adventure, musical, horror, even romantic comedy. If you want a western candle that smells like subtle leather, firewood, and bourbon vanilla, OK. The candles are selling for $48.00 each, burn time 50 or 60 hours, 33 movies -- since we did the math -- to kind of add all that up for you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What does a horror movie smell like?</p><p>CASONE: Believe me, I was actually searching that just now and I can't find it but if I find it I will let you know, like what does that mean?</p><p>HIGGINS: Probably cheese.</p><p>CASONE: I don't know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What?!</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it smells like body odor because the fright makes you sweat when you watch one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, if you want your house to smell like bourbon, drink bourbon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go. No need to spend $48.00 on a candle.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You are a walking air freshener if you drink bourbon.</p><p>BRENBERG: I want to know what a musical smell like. You are a big musical fan, right? What do musical candles smell like, that was one of them?</p><p>HIGGINS: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It depends on what song it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Her favorite one is \"Sound of Music.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it is.</p><p>HIGGINS: Right, so it's supposed to be Edelweiss.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I could watch the movie over and over.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's about time. (INAUDIBLE) -- get you in the spirit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. All right, a heartwarming response. Get this, the warrior, Stephen Curry responds with 9-year-old's request to make his popular shoes available for girls, not just boys, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, it was a Texas-ized upset in the NFL last night. Jared Max, what a win for the Dallas Cowboys, Jared?</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. Not only did the Cowboys answer that famous question: Who that team going to beat them Saints? Dallas devoured New Orleans like Cafe Du Monde Beignet. Drew Brees had led the Saints to 10-straight wins, at least 30 points, and five-straight. But alas by the (INAUDIBLE), Dallas is defensing. Dak Prescott, he found Ezekiel Elliott for the first quarter touchdown, Cowboys up 10-0. Brees had 127 yards on the night; Dallas stops him on fourth down. A late interception by Brees would seal the win for the Cowboys and end the Saints win streak at 10. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERRY JONES, OWNER, DALLAS COWBOYS: This match, this team won't be same again. I'm serious. This is a change you're in here. These guys -- well, they're different cats now as they go forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: 13-10, Cowboys, first in the NFC East half-game better than the Redskins.</p><p>Possible NBA finals preview? Last night in Toronto, two-time defending champion, Warriors, got 51 points from Kevin Durant who forced overtime against the NBA best, Raptors, back to back threes late. Stephen Curry celebrating. Steph comes back tomorrow from injury but the celebration short-lived because the Raptors win an overtime by three; Kawhi Leonard scored 37.</p><p>Check this out. Steph Curry recently received this letter from a 9-year- old girl from Napa, California. She has the same first name of Steph's daughter, Riley. She wrote, \"My dad and I visited the Under Armour Web site and we're disappointed to see there were no Curry 5's for sale under the girl's section. I hope you can work with Under Armour to change this because girls want to rock Curry 5's too.\" So, Steph replied: \"We are correcting this now. I'm going to send you a pair of Curry 5's now, and you'll be one of the first kids to get the Curry 6.\" Also said to a save the date for International Women's Day and be in Oakland for the Warriors' game.</p><p>Boxer, Floyd Mayweather, has been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mayweather owes $600,000 because he failed to disclose that he had been paid to endorse cryptocurrency ICOs, most notably for a company called Centra, whose founders are currently facing federal charges for fraud.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, failure to disclose. Basically, he got money or compensation to promote this initial coin offering and then disclose it. Listen, the SEC, by the way, they don't have the ability to file criminal charges, these are civil charges they can fine you. Nevertheless, if you've got a big name, please, they will go after you because they want to make a spectacle to try to discourage this behavior by others. D.J. Khaled was also --</p><p>MAX: Yes, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- was also, uhm.</p><p>MAX: Not hit as hard -- he had to return. Mayweather has to return $300,000 in earnings plus penalties and tax as well. But he had gone on Twitter and he's telling all of his followers, hey, you want, this is the cryptocurrency I'm getting in on. Like, right off the bat, you should know, really, is this the one? You know --</p><p>BRENBERG: You're the guy I'm going to take advice from cryptocurrency.</p><p>MAX: Exactly. Money. Moneyman, guess what, give it back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, there you go.</p><p>HIGGINS: You know what, you'd think people would be cynical enough to anticipate that there was some sort of quid pro quo for the endorsement, but you do need to disclose if there's a public filing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're cynical, but you got to tell the SEC. You got to tell -- you got to say it out loud despite us having a good --</p><p>MAX: He made it like, oh, look at this great new find. He's getting paid for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. Disclosure. Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX: Have a good weekend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115. Still ahead, a live look from at the G20 summit in Bueno Aires. Any minute now, President Trump is set to sign the USMCA deal with Mexico and Canada. The leaders of those two countries will be there. We'll have much more next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Simons</url>, a veteran antitrust lawyer who has represented tech giants like Microsoft, to lead the Federal Trade Commission at a time of broad bipartisan concern over corporate consolidation and big deals in the waiting, the White House said Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also chosen Noah Phillips, chief counsel for Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and <url normalizedValue=\"http://consumerfed.org/expert/rohit-chopra/\">Rohit Chopra</url>, a fellow at a consumer advocacy group, to fill the remaining two seats at the agency, said Natalie M. Strom, assistant press secretary at the White House.</p><p>The consumer protection and competition agency has been led by just two commissioners over the last 10 months. Mr. Trump\u2019s other leading antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, was recently confirmed to lead competition cases at the Justice Department.</p><p>The timing of the official nominations is unclear. They will be reviewed by Congress but are expected to be approved.</p><p>Under Mr. Simons, who led the competition bureau of the Federal Trade Commission during the George W. Bush administration, the agency is expected take a free-markets and conservative approach to antitrust issues, maintaining decades-long interpretations of competition laws that put consumer welfare and the efficiencies of markets at the center of enforcement actions and merger reviews.</p><p>But the traditional antitrust perspective could be tested by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/technology/tech-giants-threats.html\">new skepticism</url> over the power of big internet companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. Politicians from both parties, and many consumer interest advocates and academics, have called for greater restraints on tech companies that have quickly expanded their dominance in digital advertising, commerce and public opinion, as seen with the role social media firms like Facebook and Twitter played in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Throughout the Obama administration, the agency was viewed as taking a light touch with the tech sector, particularly with its decision to close an antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s search practices in 2013. European regulators, meanwhile, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/eu-google-fine.html\">took action</url> against Google on antitrust and have pushed for new regulations over the internet sector.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s $4.3 billion purchase of Whole Foods was quickly approved by the F.T.C. in August, largely because of ample competition in the grocery foods market.</p><p>But some antitrust academics and politicians criticized the fast review, saying the government needed to look more broadly at whether Amazon\u2019s ability to take losses and leverage other parts of its businesses harmed competition.</p><p>Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, has called on the agency to reopen an antitrust investigation into Google that was closed in 2013, saying new evidence from a parallel investigation in Europe warrants a new look. Stephen K. Bannon, the former senior adviser to Mr. Trump, has called Google a utility-like monopoly that needs antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Mr. Simons comes from the Washington offices of the law firm Paul Weiss, where he served as a partner representing big tech clients including Microsoft and Sony in a $4 billion acquisition of patents from Nortel Networks. He also represented Mastercard in antitrust class-action cases against the credit card company in federal court. But like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s picks for corporate watchdog roles, Mr. Simons has been in and out of the private and public sector for years.</p><p>Since the election, moderate Democrats and Republicans have trained their focus on corporate consolidation. The new climate, antitrust experts say, makes it difficult to predict how Mr. Simons will act.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting so long for leadership at the agencies, we are out of the speculation business until we see some enforcement under the new antitrust chiefs,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.</p><p>Jeffrey Chester, head of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, a group that has pushed for online privacy regulations and stronger competition enforcement, said the agency was \u201cat a critical turning point about whether it can be relevant at all protecting consumers in the 21st century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has been unable to effectively address the dramatic loss of privacy Americans face online,\u201d he added. \u201cThe commission has also failed to effectively tackle the growing power of the major internet companies, especially Google and Facebook.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000005504895</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PS3-DDJ1-DXY4-X1HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><timeReceived>00:00 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 19, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Simons, Joseph J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Simons, Joseph J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Trade Commission</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust Laws and Competition Issues</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Appointments and Executive Changes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Politics and Government</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>Federal Trade Commission</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Cleaning that sewer is beyond his regulatory powers. Despite what he may wish to believe, he's no demigod. He can't redirect a river to run through it. If he did, he'd wash himself away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead, he splashes around in the disgusting muck of Twitter at all hours. Mostly he attacks enemies, the Democrats and their Beltway media handmaidens, who for three years pushed that bogus Russia collusion investigation probe that found no Russia collusion.</p><p>We get the rage. But by using the Twitter platform the way he does, he demeans the presidency. It's as if he's one of those mean girl trolls who live to humiliate people. That is, if mean girls had nukes.</p><p>Trump isn't a teenager, nor is he a lefty pajama boy in a fuzzy pink hat living in the basement of mommy's house. He's in our house. The White House. He's president of the United States.</p><p>He issued a recent incendiary tweet about the rioters and looters in Minneapolis tearing up the city after a white cop, Derek Chauvin, killed George Floyd, an African American man, by choking him with his knee. Twitter flagged Trump's tweet for glorifying violence.</p><p>\"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\"</p><p>When the looting starts, the shooting starts? Will Trump next channel the late Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's \"shoot to kill\" order?</p><p>Arson, riots and looting TVs aren't legitimate protest. To say so is foolish, irresponsible sophistry. President Barack Obama also condemned what he called \"thugs and criminals\" in reference to rioters in Baltimore in another police death case. But Obama was silky. Trump is not. And Obama didn't have crazy Twitter thumbs.</p><p>The president is now formally at war with Twitter. Big Tech shapes much of our public speech and has become a Ministry of Truth of sorts. He'll use all this to rally his base. But he weakens himself.</p><p>Trump's coarseness and rage might sound tough. But tough guys I've known never raise their voice. They don't have to.</p><p>Recently, he went after a critic he loathes, MSNBC commentator Joe Scarborough. Trump retweeted a wild conspiracy theory that the former Congressman was somehow involved in a former staffer's death.</p><p>\"A lot of interest in this story about Psycho Joe Scarborough,\" Trump tweeted. \"So a young marathon runner just happened to faint in his office, hit her head on his desk, &amp; die? I would think there is a lot more to this story than that? An affair? What about the so-called investigator? Read story!\"</p><p>That was reprehensible, without honor. This was the smear of a gossip, not a president.</p><p>Scarborough has pushed his own wild theories about Trump and Russia, and suggested Trump is insane. But here the president supports Scarborough's case. Because what Trump did with Scarborough debases the White House. And that is crazy.</p><p>I get it. Trump uses Twitter to speak directly to the American people, rather than have his words shaped by Beltway media that has proved it despises him. I use Twitter too. I often wish I didn't have to, but it is a painful fact of life for a writer. Yet after using it, I reach for the hand sanitizer.</p><p>As I was writing this, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot decided to splash around in the same political sewer as Trump.</p><p>She's worried about the violence here. She's admitted that Chicago homicides and shootings are out of control. She has problems with her cops.</p><p>Meanwhile, panicky Illinois Democrats are begging for a federal bailout for that $140 billion unfunded public worker pension hole they have dropped taxpayers into.When this Ponzi scheme collapses, Democrats don't want to wear the jacket.</p><p>So, even as she's desperate for federal help, what did Lightfoot do? She played the Trump card to rally her own base.</p><p>\"His goal is to polarize, to destabilize local government and inflame racist urges,\" Lightfoot said on Friday with her mouth, not her thumbs, about Trump. \"... And I will code what I really want to say to Donald Trump. It's two words. It begins with F and it ends with U.\"</p><p>I like Lori and supported her campaign in this column. And the witless will applaud her. But someone should whisper to her -- if they dare -- that she's really not some tough-talking fictional character like Tugboat Annie or Yara Greyjoy from \"Game of Thrones.\" She's mayor of Chicago. And when she rolls in the mud, she coarsens herself and demeans her office, as Trump has done.</p><p>F and U? Really?</p><p>Trump doesn't care about Illinois. He's a transactional man and knows he has little political chance here.</p><p>But in Illinois and across the country, tens of millions of jobs have been lost due to the state-by-state coronavirus shutdown of commerce.</p><p>It was a great economy, once. Now millions of those jobs will never return. We haven't seen the worst of this.</p><p>In November, voters will select a president based on which candidate they believe will bring the economy back.</p><p>If Trump loses the election in November to a half-lucid Joe Biden, he can blame his Twitter fetish. But then it will be too late to lop off those Twitter thumbs by presidential decree.</p><p>Listen to \"The Chicago Way\" podcast with John Kass and Jeff Carlin -- at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wgnradio.com/category/wgn-plus/thechicagoway\">www.wgnradio.com/category/wgn-plus/thechicagoway</url>.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jskass@chicagotribune.com\">jskass@chicagotribune.com</email></p><p>Twitter @John_Kass ct20 0214 200531 N S 0000000000 00005062</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: A looter uses a claw hammer as he tries to break into a cash register at a Target store in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Biden Jr. </p><p>In the tweet, he appealed to \u201cpeople living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream,\u201d promising them that they would \u201cno longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>He explicitly referenced his administration\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">move last week</url> to roll back an Obama-era program intended to combat racial segregation in suburban housing. The program <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">expanded provisions</url> in the Fair Housing Act to encourage diversification and \u201cfoster inclusive communities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down,\u201d he wrote.</p><p>And during his remarks in West Texas later on Wednesday, Mr. Trump warned that \u201cthe radical left\u201d was a threat to \u201cevery American value\u201d and again bragged that he\u2019d ended a government program that tries to reduce segregation in suburban areas.</p><p>\u201cPeople fight all of their lives to get into the suburbs and have a beautiful home,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no more low income housing forced into the suburbs.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been hell for suburbia,\u201d he added, before telling the audience to \u201cenjoy your life, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Trump and his father were sued by the Justice Department in the 1970s for their company\u2019s practice of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">discriminating against Black tenants</url>.</p><p>His remarks on Wednesday were further evidence that he is deploying a strategy rooted in racism, classism and fear-mongering as he courts white suburban voters, particularly white suburban women, who were the key to his victory in 2016 but are slipping away from him.</p><p>And his vision of the suburbs as white is outdated, as they become more economically and racially diverse.</p><p>In 2018, support from suburban voters helped Democrats retake the House of Representatives. The following year, voters in the suburbs helped Democrats win governorships in reliably red states like Kentucky and Louisiana. </p><p>Mr. Trump made similar remarks last week when he first announced his administration\u2019s plans to eliminate the Obama-era rule.</p><p>\u201cThe Suburban Housewives of America must read this article,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">Mr. Trump said</url>, referring to an opinion piece in The New York Post that attacked the housing rule and Mr. Biden, Mr. Obama\u2019s vice president. \u201cBiden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream. I will preserve it, and make it even better!\u201d</p><p>A spokesman for the Biden campaign said last week that Mr. Trump was trying to distract from his handling of the coronavirus. Mr. Biden has proposed a housing policy that would combat systemic racism, including by ending redlining and other discriminatory practices in the housing market and providing a tax credit of up to $15,000 for first-time home buyers. </p><p>On Tuesday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">Mr. Biden unveiled wide-ranging plans</url> to address systemic racism in the economy. </p><p>During a discussion on Wednesday afternoon with Janet Murgu\u00eda, president of the UnidosUS Action Fund, Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump\u2019s messaging stemmed from his own fear that he was losing the suburbs. </p><p>\u201cLook what he\u2019s doing now, the president,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to scare because an awful lot of suburbanites are now deciding they\u2019re going to vote for me, at least the data suggests, as opposed to him.\u201d</p><p>Obama will deliver a eulogy at John Lewis\u2019s funeral.</p><p>Former President Barack Obama will deliver a eulogy at John Lewis\u2019s funeral on Thursday. Two other former presidents, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, will also attend the funeral, which will be held at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.</p><p>Mr. Lewis, a civil rights icon who represented Atlanta in Congress for more than three decades, died on July 17 at age 80, amid a national reckoning over racism and police brutality. This week, he became the first Black lawmaker to lie in state in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol.</p><p>A new poll shows Biden tied with Trump in Georgia.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden are locked in a tight race for Georgia, while at least one of the state\u2019s two Senate seats currently appears on track to remain in Republican hands, according to a new poll of voters there released Wednesday. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">The survey</url>, conducted by Monmouth University, shows Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden tied with 47 percent support each and only three percent of registered voters indicating that they were undecided. </p><p>It also shows Republicans ahead in both of the state\u2019s crucial Senate races. In the tighter of the two contests, Senator David Perdue, the Republican incumbent, currently leads Jon Ossoff, his Democratic challenger, by six percentage points, according to the poll. </p><p>Senator Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to her seat late last year by Gov. Brian Kemp, must defend her seat in a special election in November that will feature candidates from both parties; she leads the large group with 26 percent support and is followed by another Republican, Representative Doug Collins, who garnered 20 percent support. The leading Democrat, Matt Lieberman, was the choice of just 14 percent of voters, while another Democrat, the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, had the support of 9 percent. </p><p>The Monmouth poll of 402 registered voters comes as some <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">Democrats are pressing the Biden campaign to expand its ambitions</url> and compete aggressively in states like Georgia, where a win could help solidify an Electoral College victory and deal a damaging blow to Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of politics. The Monmouth poll of Georgia voters was conducted by telephone from July 23 to 27 and has a margin of error of +/- 5 percentage points. </p><p>Georgia has long been seen by Democrats as a fast-changing state where electoral success could <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">help carve a new path to the presidency</url>. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has mostly focused on a handful of more traditional battleground states in the months since he became the presumptive nominee. </p><p>On Tuesday, the Biden campaign announced a round of key staff hires in Georgia, including a state director, a pair of senior advisers, and other top positions. </p><p>But the campaign has yet to spend any money on advertising in the state and the Trump campaign has invested only about $150,000 there so far \u2014 a signal that, at least at this stage of the race, neither side is ready to jump into what could be a costly contest. </p><p>By comparison, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has spent far larger sums in more traditional battleground states</url> like Florida, where his campaign has invested more than $17 million since the general election began in earnest in April, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. Mr. Biden has also spent heavily in Florida, spending roughly $8 million on the airwaves there.</p><p>Asked about Russian bounties, Trump says his phone call with Putin focused on \u2018other things.\u2019</p><p>Mr. Trump said in a new interview that he had not raised concerns with President Vladimir V. Putin about intelligence suggesting that Russia covertly offered <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">bounties</url> for killing U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan in a recent phone call he had with the country\u2019s leader. </p><p>\u201cI have never discussed it with him,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview, conducted on Tuesday by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">\u201cAxios on HBO,\u201d</url> which released excerpts Wednesday morning.  The full interview is scheduled to air next week.</p><p>Mr. Trump spoke with Mr. Putin by telephone <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">last week</url>, but during a public appearance on Monday, he declined to say whether he had raised the issue during the conversation. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion,\u201d he told reporters.</p><p>But Mr. Trump was more direct when pressed by the Axios reporter Jonathan Swan on if he had confronted Mr. Putin about the intelligence, which was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">first reported by The New York Times</url>. </p><p>\u201cThat was a phone call to discuss other things, and frankly that\u2019s an issue that many people said was fake news,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump said the purpose of the call was \u201cto discuss nuclear proliferation,\u201d calling that issue \u201ca much bigger problem than global warming.\u201d</p><p>Although Mr. Trump cast the bounty allegation as a media fiction, U.S. intelligence analysts found <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">evidence</url> of the scheme credible, although some intelligence officials have higher confidence on the question than others. The intelligence was provided to Mr. Trump in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">written briefing</url> in February, but it is unclear whether he read it.</p><p>Mr. Trump\u2019s comments to Axios were made public the morning after he held a coronavirus briefing in which he lamented how his approval ratings were lower than two top government medical experts and once again defended the false claim that hydroxychloroquine was a \u201ccure\u201d for the virus.</p><p>His dismissive remarks about the bounties, which amounted to a verbal shrug, along with his wandering rhetoric at the briefing offered more evidence that last week\u2019s brief foray into greater political discipline had ended quickly, with polls showing him considerably behind Mr. Biden nationally and many Americans unhappy with his response to the pandemic.</p><p>On Tuesday, he faced fresh questions about why <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">he had retweeted a viral video</url> the day before that included false claims about hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>And <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">he devolved into self-pity</url>, at one point bemoaning the fact that Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, his administration\u2019s top coronavirus coordinator, have high approval ratings even as his own have sagged.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re highly thought of \u2014 but nobody likes me,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cIt can only be my personality,\u201d he concluded. </p><p>The president floats the idea of giving his renomination speech at the White House, a likely Hatch Act violation.</p><p>Mr. Trump said Wednesday he may give his renomination speech in August from the White House, an idea that took some of his advisers by surprise and that many thought was an unlikely scenario that would be nixed by the White House counsel\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re thinking about,\u201d  Mr. Trump told reporters as he departed from the South Lawn of the White House for a day trip to Texas. He said he would be announcing the location of his speech \u201cfairly soon.\u201d</p><p>Giving a political speech from the White House would be a violation of the Hatch Act. While the president himself is technically exempt from the act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activities while on the job, everyone who works for him is subject to it.</p><p>\u201cI suppose if he was determined to hold his iPhone to his face, he could do it,\u201d said Norm Eisen, the former ethics czar in the Obama administration. \u201cBut from the speechwriters at the White House, to the people setting up the lights and the teleprompters, to the staff escorting people to be there for this event, it would be a wholesale conspiracy to violate both our laws and norms.\u201d</p><p>He added that it was important \u201cto comply with not only the strict letter of the law, but the spirit.\u201d</p><p>On Tuesday evening, a group of aides, including Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, met with top campaign advisers at the White House to discuss potential plans for the four nights of the Republican National Convention, which Mr. Trump announced last week he was canceling because of the pandemic. </p><p>The group did not settle on a location for Mr. Trump\u2019s renomination speech, people familiar with the conversation said, but they discussed having Mr. Trump speak from a critical battleground state.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">local television</url> station reported on Wednesday that Vice President Mike Pence said in an interview that the president would give his acceptance speech in Charlotte, N.C., where the Republican National Convention had been originally set. The White House and the campaign did not immediately confirm the details.</p><p>Republican officials and campaign advisers have just under three weeks to figure out a new location for the programming they had been set to hold in Jacksonville, Fla., and to finalize a roster of speakers. Even without a full convention, officials said, they are set on capitalizing on a week of earned media highlighting what they see as Mr. Trump\u2019s accomplishments and record.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Trump announced he would visit Charlotte on Aug. 24 to visit a few hundred delegates who are still planning to convene there for a day of convention business, and for the official roll call where the president is renominated. Mr. Trump is not expected to give extended remarks during the visit.</p><p>During a hearing on antitrust, Republicans accuse big tech of censoring conservative views.</p><p>What was billed as a hearing about the monopolistic practices of big technology companies devolved into an debate over what one Democratic House member called \u201cfringe conspiracy theories\u201d advanced by Republican lawmakers, illustrating the political undercurrent of congressional oversight in Silicon Valley.</p><p>\u201cConservatives are consumers, too,\u201d said Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, the highest-ranking Republican on the panel. \u201cReports that dissenting views, often conservative ones, are targeted or censored is seriously troubling. The power to influence debate carries with it remarkable responsibilities,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mr. Sensenbrenner, of Wisconsin, questioned why Donald Trump Jr. was sanctioned this week when he tweeted a video of doctors making unfounded claims about the use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven treatment for Covid-19.</p><p>\u201cThat happened on Twitter,\u201d Facebook\u2019s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, said when Mr. Sensenbrenner asked him about it. Mr. Zuckerberg told lawmakers, nevertheless, that while Facebook wants to give everyone a voice, some content would be censored.</p><p>\u201cStating that there\u2019s a proven cure for Covid when there is in fact none might be harmful,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mr. Sensenbrenner suggested that the drug\u2019s value was a \u201clegitimate matter of discussion and it ought to be up to a patient and their doctor.\u201d</p><p>In addition to Mr. Zuckerberg, executives of Google, Apple and Amazon appeared during the hearing, which took place before a Judiciary Committee subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>While Democrats raised concerns about the proliferation of fake accounts on Facebook and about foreign interference in U.S. elections by social media manipulation, Republicans hinted at potential tech regulation because of the industry\u2019s perceived liberal predispositions.</p><p>Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, reeled off a long list of what he said were examples of censorship against conservative views.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just cut to the chase, Big Tech\u2019s out to get conservatives,\u201d said Mr. Jordan. He later accused the companies of \u201ctrying to impact elections\u201d and \u201ccensoring conservatives.\u201d And he demanded that Sundar Pichai, the C.E.O. of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, commit to not helping Joe Biden in the lead-up to the November election.</p><p>In response, Representative Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, said, \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about actual antitrust issues and not fringe conspiracy theories.\u201d</p><p>The claims about conservative bias are a persistent, if largely unproven, gripe among Republicans. Mr. Trump, Attorney General William P. Barr and lawmakers like Mr. Jordan and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have all raised concerns that Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube purposely downplay or remove conservative voices on their sites.</p><p>Val Demings, a V.P. finalist, has a complicated record on police accountability.</p><p>Mr. Biden told reporters on Tuesday that he would decide on a running mate \u201cin the first week in August.\u201d But for now, his choice is still anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>One woman who is on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">the short list</url> is Val Demings, a second-term Democratic congresswoman from Florida. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">a profile, Brian M. Rosenthal and Patricia Mazzei write</url> that Ms. Demings, a former police chief in Orlando, Fla., is having a moment in the spotlight as the nation reckons with the difficult legacy of police brutality and racial discrimination.</p><p>If she is chosen as the vice-presidential nominee, her career could prove to be a political asset against an incumbent president who is building his re-election campaign around his call for law and order, while <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">attacking Mr. Biden as weak on crime</url>. But in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, with protests continuing to rock the country, it could also be a political liability.</p><p>In recent weeks, Ms. Demings has become a leading voice calling for changes in policing, and she has cast herself as an experienced reformer, repeating that she started out as a social worker and brought a \u201csocial worker\u2019s heart\u201d to police work. But a review by The New York Times shows a more complicated record: that of a police leader with a long history of defending the status quo.</p><p>An anti-Trump group is starting an Instagram meme campaign to sway voters and bring young people to the polls.</p><p>The Lincoln Project, the group of anti-Trump Republicans who have gained prominence with their no-holds-barred attack ads, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">is starting an Instagram campaign</url> in partnership with social media influencers and the progressive viral media company Rhyme Combinator.</p><p>The campaign \u2014 led by Meme 2020, a collection of Instagram influencers who supported Michael Bloomberg during the Democratic presidential primary, and funded by the tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman \u2014 is intended both to sway voters away from Mr. Trump and to encourage people to register to vote by mail.</p><p>In particular, it is aimed at members of Generation Z \u2014 people born after 1996 \u2014 who will be an estimated 10 percent of the eligible electorate this year but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">did not turn out to vote in the primaries</url> as much as some candidates and advocates had hoped.</p><p>The campaign began on Wednesday with a series of memes showing texts from \u201cF.B.I. agent\u201d popping up over a vote-by-mail application. (\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you\u2019re finding new and creative ways to avoid other people,\u201d one says.) Sarah Lenti, executive director of the Lincoln Project, said the group planned to continue the campaign through Election Day.</p><p>The memes coming later are \u201cnot so dark as the Lincoln Project tends to go \u2014 they\u2019re going to be biting, but they\u2019re funny,\u201d Ms. Lenti said. The idea, she added, is to emphasize \u201cthe absurdity of what we\u2019re actually watching right now.\u201d</p><p>It is a stark departure from the Lincoln Project\u2019s usual slash-and-burn ads, which have mocked Mr. Trump\u2019s physical and cognitive health, described the coronavirus as \u201cTrump\u2019s virus now\u201d and called Senator Susan Collins a \u201cfraud\u201d who obeys Mr. Trump\u2019s and Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s orders.</p><p>Ms. Lenti and Mick Purzycki, the founder and chief executive of Meme 2020, said the group had spent months testing various memes to determine which were most effective. Mr. Purzycki said that research had shown that memes directly attacking Mr. Trump were less effective.</p><p>In Tennessee\u2019s Senate Republican primary race, candidates accuse each other of supporting Black Lives Matter.</p><p>With just over a week until Tennessee\u2019s Senate Republican primary on Aug. 6, Black Lives Matter has emerged as a major flash point in the race, with the top two candidates attempting to tie each other \u2014 however tenuously \u2014 to a movement that has slim support among the state\u2019s Republican voters. </p><p>With help from a politically conservative super PAC, Bill Hagerty, the Trump-endorsed front-runner, has in recent days attacked his opponent, Dr. Manny Sethi, for donating to ActBlue, a major progressive fund-raising platform. (Dr. Sethi gave the organization $50 in 2008.) The PAC, which is operated by Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, ridiculed Dr. Sethi for giving to \u201cthe left-wing group that subsidizes the Antifa thugs that attack our police.\u201d</p><p>Now, Dr. Sethi, an orthopedic trauma surgeon, is hitting back with a web ad that highlights Mr. Hagerty\u2019s position on the board of an investment firm that issued statements supporting Black Lives Matter following George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of police in Minnesota. (Mr. Hagerty resigned from the board of R.J. O\u2019Brien &amp;amp; Associates on Saturday after a conservative news outlet publicized his position and the firm\u2019s support of B.L.M.)</p><p>\u201cBill Hagerty has spent millions of dollars attacking Manny Sethi, trying to fool you into thinking Dr. Manny\u2019s for Black Lives Matter. Not true,\u201d the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">Sethi campaign\u2019s ad begins</url>. \u201cBut while Hagerty\u2019s been slamming Dr. Manny, it\u2019s Hagerty who\u2019s been on the board of a company for years that is a huge supporter of B.L.M.\u201d The ad says Mr. Hagerty did not acknowledge his position on his financial disclosure form \u201cuntil he got caught red-handed.\u201d</p><p>The Tennessee Star recently published Mr. Hagerty\u2019s resignation letter, which included a misleading and inflammatory characterization of Black Lives Matter. </p><p>\u201cI have learned that the firm has promoted support for the Black Lives Matter movement, a Marxist organization that seeks to destroy the America that I know and long to support,\u201d Mr. Hagerty wrote.</p><p>Representative Louie Gohmert, who refuses to wear masks in the Capitol, tests positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>Representative Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican who has frequently refused to wear a mask in the Capitol, tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday ahead of a planned trip with Mr. Trump on Air Force One, officials familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The results immediately sent a shudder through the Capitol, where Mr. Gohmert has actively participated in multiple congressional hearings this week, including Tuesday\u2019s Judiciary Committee session with Attorney General William P. Barr.</p><p>Lawmakers and Mr. Barr were seated more than six feet apart during the hearing, but reporters spotted an unmasked Mr. Gohmert outside the hearing room exchanging words with Mr. Barr and in close proximity to him. He also participated in a hearing held by the Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday, without wearing a mask, possibly spreading the virus.</p><p>Mr. Gohmert is among a group of House Republicans who have pointedly refused to wear masks in many instances while in the Capitol in recent weeks despite warnings from public health experts and an outbreak in his home state. He told CNN last month that he did not wear a mask because he did not have coronavirus.</p><p>\u201cBut if I get it, you\u2019ll never see me without a mask,\u201d he said.</p><p>Democrats were furious at the news, and both parties spent Wednesday morning scrambling to retrace Mr. Gohmert\u2019s steps. The House Judiciary Committee was waiting for official guidance from Congress\u2019s attending physician. It is a daunting task since Mr. Gohmert is a frequent schmoozer who could have come into close contact with dozens of fellow lawmakers and aides this week alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the irresponsible behavior of many of the republicans who have chosen to consistently flout well established public health guidance,\u201d said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and a member of the Judiciary Committee. He pleaded with Republicans like Mr. Gohmert to put on masks or go home. </p><p>Members of Congress have been flying between Washington and their home states \u2014 some of which are experiencing serious outbreaks \u2014 weekly, and they are not required to be tested. Mr. Gohmert only received a test because he was scheduled to be in close proximity to the president.</p><p>Later, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats in a private conference call that she would start mandating masks on the House floor, according to a person on the call who told The Times on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Trump has quietly retreated from Michigan\u2019s airwaves.</p><p>Michigan was expected to be one of the most intense battlegrounds in the country, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has quietly receded from television airwaves</url> in the state in recent weeks.</p><p>With Mr. Biden building a steady advantage in the polls, a state that Mr. Trump won narrowly in 2016 threatens to move more firmly back into the Democratic column in 2020.</p><p>Since the end of June, Mr. Trump has spent more money on ads in 10 other states \u2014 with Michigan falling behind even much smaller states like Iowa and Nevada \u2014 and in recent days Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign stopped buying ads in Michigan entirely.</p><p>The Biden campaign has more than tripled what Mr. Trump spent on television in Michigan in the last month, by far the most lopsided advantage of any swing state where both are advertising. And in Detroit, the state\u2019s largest media market, the Trump campaign last ran a television ad, outside of national ad buys that include the state, on July 3, according to data from Advertising Analytics.</p><p>Mr. Trump faces a trifecta of troubles in Michigan, according to political strategists and state polling: reduced support among less educated white voters in a contest against Mr. Biden compared with Hillary Clinton; motivated Black voters in the state\u2019s urban centers; and suburban voters who continue to flee Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive brand of politics nationwide.</p><p>\u201cOf all the states he won in 2016, Trump would be most hard-pressed to keep Michigan in his column this time around,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster for Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC.</p><p>On Michelle Obama\u2019s new podcast, she and her husband warn against cynicism and apathy.</p><p>Barack and Michelle Obama, the former president and first lady, in the first episode of Mrs. Obama\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">new podcast</url>, described what they saw as a change in American values among the younger generation.</p><p>In a roughly 45-minute conversation released Wednesday, the Obamas expressed concern about some younger Americans\u2019 apathy toward politics and government and blamed parents like themselves for telling their children to dream big without working to institutionalize the values that they espoused around the dinner table. </p><p>\u201cThe danger for this generation is that they become too deeply cynical in government, not understanding that all government is, is us collectively making decisions together,\u201d Mr. Obama said. </p><p>\u201cYoung people are idealistic as they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d he added later with the caution: \u201cThere are some things we just can\u2019t do by ourselves.\u201d</p><p>The Obamas shared intimate stories about their own upbringings, spoke about the importance of community, and shared how their early careers taught them that chasing individual success would bring only isolation and loneliness.</p><p>\u201cOne of the reasons I fell in love with you, is because you are guided by the principle that we are each other\u2019s brothers and sister\u2019s keepers,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I was raised.\u201d</p><p>They expressed concern that Americans had become more focused on material things than on relationships in a quest \u201cto have it all,\u201d as Mrs. Obama put it. Mr. Obama argued that a sort of \u201ccutthroat competition\u201d had emerged between anxious Americans constantly assessing their place in a \u201cpecking order\u201d relative to everyone else. </p><p>\u201cAnd that then reflects itself in our politics, right?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause at a certain point, I am going to start thinking about politics in terms of how do I protect me? Not how do I look after us.\u201d</p><p>But he argued for a more inclusive view \u2014 for Americans to embrace the ideas that \u201cour tribe is everybody.\u201d And he said he was encouraged by young people protesting systemic racism and police brutality, adding that they have shown that their instinct was to \u201clift all boats.\u201d</p><p>Democrats introduce a new group to attack congressional Republicans over ethics issues.</p><p>Tired of watching Republicans with their own checkered ethics backgrounds attack Mr. Biden over his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, a group of Democratic officials on Wednesday introduced an organization intended to target corruption by congressional Republicans.</p><p>The group, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">Congressional Integrity Project</url>, released the first of what its organizers say will be a series of reports called \u201cCovering for Corruption.\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">The five-page document</url> aims to highlight what the group calls business self-dealing by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, accusations of which have been reported in the past but that Democrats largely did not highlight during his 2016 re-election campaign or while pushing back against Mr. Johnson\u2019s attempts to investigate the Bidens.</p><p>\u201cFor too long, members of Congress like Ron Johnson have put their own personal interests before the needs of the American public, covering for Trump\u2019s corruption and ignoring their oversight responsibilities,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, the new group\u2019s executive director. \u201cWhile conservatives try to distract the American people with baseless, partisan investigations, we will use every tool at our disposal to stop officials like Johnson from misleading and manipulating voters.\u201d</p><p>Of course, few Washington politicians have used the federal government to boost their personal business interests more than Mr. Trump has, so it remains to be seen how effective the new organization will be in damaging the political reputation of Mr. Johnson, who doesn\u2019t face re-election until 2022, and other future targets.</p><p>\u2018Do not hold grudges\u2019: Photos emerge of Biden\u2019s talking points on Kamala Harris.</p><p>For those wondering about whom <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">Mr. Biden\u2019s running mate</url> will be, handwritten notes that he held at an event on Tuesday, where he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">laid out his plan to address systemic racism</url> in the economy, offered a tantalizing clue.</p><p>Written on top was the name of someone thought to be a top contender: Senator Kamala Harris of California. Five talking points followed:</p><p>\u201cDo not hold grudges.\u201d \u201cCampaigned with me &amp;amp; Jill.\u201d \u201cTalented.\u201d \u201cGreat help to campaign.\u201d \u201cGreat respect for her.\u201d</p><p>The notes about Ms. Harris \u2014 which were captured by photographers and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/19/us/dnc-convention-election\">reported by The Associated Press</url> \u2014 indicate that he was prepared to field questions about her.</p><p>That may not mean anything about her likelihood (or not) of being picked. Mr. Biden \u2014 who is often quite fond of talking \u2014 had relatively little to say when asked on Tuesday about his vice-presidential search. But he did tell reporters one thing: He will make his selection next week.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by Maggie Astor, Nate Cohn, Nick Corasaniti, Michael Crowley, Reid J.

One of the individuals confirmed Microsoft was in the lead to acquire the popular platform's U.S. service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the order was expected to be signed Friday, people had warned that it could fall through since the president was also considering other approaches, including designating TikTok under an executive order that allows the president to exclude national security threats from U.S. networks.</p><p>Late Friday, the president told reporters on Air Force One while returning to Washington from Florida that he was not in favor of a deal to let a U.S. company buy TikTok's American operations. Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to ban TikTok. </p><p>\"Well, I have that authority. I can do it with an executive order or that,\" he said, referring to emergency economic powers.</p><p>The order that would force a sale, which stems from a national security investigation, is fairly rare but has been used by Trump as recently as March, when the president ordered a Chinese company to sell its stake in a U.S. hotel-software company. Last year, the Trump administration used it to demand the Chinese owners of gay dating app Grindr give up control of the company.</p><p>If Microsoft did acquire TikTok, it would make it a major rival to Facebook, Google's YouTube and other tech giants overnight, dramatically reshaping the U.S. social media landscape.</p><p>The prospect of a forced sale came amid growing concern among U.S. officials that the Chinese government could access users' private data, something that prompted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to say earlier this month that the United States is \"certainly looking at\" banning TikTok.</p><p>Branches of the U.S. military, including the Army and Navy, have banned the app from government-issued phones. The Pentagon urged its employees last year to uninstall the app because of  security concerns.</p><p>On Friday, Trump reiterated that option. </p><p>\"We may be banning TikTok,\" the president told reporters before leaving for Florida. \"We may be doing some other things. There are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening, so we'll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.\"</p><p>TikTok spokeswoman Hilary McQuaide declined to comment on the expected order, but she said they are \"confident in the long-term success of TikTok.\" Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the news on the divestiture.</p><p>TikTok has continually insisted that it does not hand over information to the Chinese government. \"We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked,\" McQuaide said last month.</p><p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an interagency body whose powers were strengthened by 2018 legislation, recommends to the president whether certain proposed takeovers should be rejected, and whether completed takeovers should be reversed, on national security grounds. CFIUS began investigating an acquisition by Beijing-based ByteDance after lawmakers asked the government to step in over national security concerns.</p><p>ByteDance bought karaoke app Musical.ly in 2017 and merged it with TikTok, launching the app to mass popularity in the United States.</p><p>James Andrew Lewis, vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said foreign companies usually take the hint when they think a demand from the U.S. government will be coming.</p><p>\"Usually, everyone gets the message and takes action without waiting for formal government action,\" he said.</p><p>Buying TikTok could reshape the Big Tech landscape, giving Microsoft a strong foothold in the U.S. consumer market with one of the world's fastest-growing social media platforms. Unlike many of its competitors, Microsoft does not have a creative social media company to sow brand recognition with younger users, though the Redmond, Wash.-based company does own professional networking site LinkedIn.</p><p>While the acquisition could raise some antitrust eyebrows, regulators haven't typically blocked acquisitions of business lines that are dissimilar from what a company already does. Microsoft also has deep ties with the U.S. government, most recently winning the Pentagon's JEDI cloud computing contract. Microsoft as a buyer could help quell administration security concerns about TikTok data.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called out TikTok as a rival during a congressional antitrust hearing earlier this week, at which Microsoft was noticeably absent.</p><p>TikTok has tried in recent months to convince U.S. users and regulators of its strong ties to the country. It emphasizes that it has hundreds of employees in the United States and even hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer to be its new chief executive in May.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mayer pledged the company will allow U.S. regulators and privacy experts to take a closer look under its digital hood, offering them the ability to \"examine\" its underlying software code in response to claims it is handing off data to the Chinese government.</p><p>The app, which lets users create and post short videos with music and other effects, has surged in popularity even more during the coronavirus pandemic as people search for at-home activities and distractions. Teens are especially active on TikTok, creating videos showcasing their dancing, pranks and cooking skills.</p><p>This is the latest in a string of moves by the Trump administration to counter Chinese tech giants.</p><p>Tension has already come to a head over Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the world's largest provider of mobile network gear - a field from which U.S. companies are largely absent. The United States calls Huawei a security risk, which the company denies, and has undertaken an international lobbying campaign to persuade other countries not to buy from Huawei.</p><p>The Trump administration has also targeted other Chinese companies, restricting trade with more than a dozen it accuses of supplying surveillance gear in the western province of Xinjiang, where U.S. officials and human rights groups say China's ruling Communist Party is holding Muslims in mass detention camps.</p><p>The Trump administration has also previously used CFIUS to scrutinize, block or reverse Chinese acquisitions.</p><p>In March, Trump ordered a Chinese company to divest all ownership of a U.S. hotel-software company, saying the Beijing investor could harm U.S. national security. A written order from the president's office suggested the administration was concerned about Chinese access to StayNTouch's hotel guest data.</p><p>The order, which followed a CFIUS review, instructed the Chinese company to immediately refrain from accessing any of StayNTouch's hotel guest data.</p><p>The Chinese company, Beijing Shiji Information Technology, acquired StayNTouch in 2018, saying the U.S. company's software was used in connection with 90,000 hotel rooms globally.</p><p>After the order was issued, Beijing Shiji said it was \"not a threat to U.S. security in any way.\"</p><p>\"We offered a range of significant proposals to mitigate any concerns the U.S. government might have, including further restricting access to guest data and appointing an independent monitor to ensure these protections. Unfortunately, those offers were rebuffed,\" the company said at the time.</p><p>In 2018, after a CFIUS review, Trump ordered Singapore-based Broadcom to abandon its $117 billion bid for the U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm, blocking what would have been one of the biggest technology deals in history.</p><p>A full presidential order is not always required to block or reverse a deal. Lawyers familiar with CFIUS reviews say the national security committee can tell a foreign company: Sell the asset or the president will issue an order.</p><p>That appears to be what happened last year, when the Trump administration forced a Chinese company to sell its majority stake in a U.S. health-care data company, PatientsLikeMe.</p><p>When Pompeo said last month that TikTok might be banned, frantic users took to the app to bemoan its potential demise and urge followers to find them on other social media sites.</p><p>\"I really hope that this will not happen,\" one user said in a video. \"All the videos, all the memories of you. This can't be true.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ellen.nakashima@washpost.com\">ellen.nakashima@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rachel.lerman@washpost.com\">rachel.lerman@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jeanne.whalen@washpost.com\">jeanne.whalen@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-65d9aa1ad38711ea8c5561e7fa5e82ab</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GN-WW81-DXXY-30NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Met 2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

One of the individuals confirmed Microsoft was in the lead to acquire the popular platform's U.S. service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the order was expected to be signed Friday, people had warned that it could fall through since the president was also considering other approaches, including designating TikTok under an executive order that allows the president to exclude national security threats from U.S. networks.</p><p>Late Friday, the president told reporters on Air Force One while returning to Washington from Florida that he was not in favor of a deal to let a U.S. company buy TikTok's American operations. Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to ban TikTok. </p><p>\"Well, I have that authority. I can do it with an executive order or that,\" he said, referring to emergency economic powers.</p><p>The order that would force a sale, which stems from a national security investigation, is fairly rare but has been used by Trump as recently as March, when the president ordered a Chinese company to sell its stake in a U.S. hotel-software company. Last year, the Trump administration used it to demand the Chinese owners of gay dating app Grindr give up control of the company.</p><p>If Microsoft did acquire TikTok, it would make it a major rival to Facebook, Google's YouTube and other tech giants overnight, dramatically reshaping the U.S. social media landscape.</p><p>The prospect of a forced sale came amid growing concern among U.S. officials that the Chinese government could access users' private data, something that prompted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to say earlier this month that the United States is \"certainly looking at\" banning TikTok.</p><p>Branches of the U.S. military, including the Army and Navy, have banned the app from government-issued phones. The Pentagon urged its employees last year to uninstall the app because of  security concerns.</p><p>On Friday, Trump reiterated that option. </p><p>\"We may be banning TikTok,\" the president told reporters before leaving for Florida. \"We may be doing some other things. There are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening, so we'll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.\"</p><p>TikTok spokeswoman Hilary McQuaide declined to comment on the expected order, but she said they are \"confident in the long-term success of TikTok.\" Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the news on the divestiture.</p><p>TikTok has continually insisted that it does not hand over information to the Chinese government. \"We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked,\" McQuaide said last month.</p><p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an interagency body whose powers were strengthened by 2018 legislation, recommends to the president whether certain proposed takeovers should be rejected, and whether completed takeovers should be reversed, on national security grounds. CFIUS began investigating an acquisition by Beijing-based ByteDance after lawmakers asked the government to step in over national security concerns.</p><p>ByteDance bought karaoke app Musical.ly in 2017 and merged it with TikTok, launching the app to mass popularity in the United States.</p><p>James Andrew Lewis, vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said foreign companies usually take the hint when they think a demand from the U.S. government will be coming.</p><p>\"Usually, everyone gets the message and takes action without waiting for formal government action,\" he said.</p><p>Buying TikTok could reshape the Big Tech landscape, giving Microsoft a strong foothold in the U.S. consumer market with one of the world's fastest-growing social media platforms. Unlike many of its competitors, Microsoft does not have a creative social media company to sow brand recognition with younger users, though the Redmond, Wash.-based company does own professional networking site LinkedIn.</p><p>While the acquisition could raise some antitrust eyebrows, regulators haven't typically blocked acquisitions of business lines that are dissimilar from what a company already does. Microsoft also has deep ties with the U.S. government, most recently winning the Pentagon's JEDI cloud computing contract. Microsoft as a buyer could help quell administration security concerns about TikTok data.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called out TikTok as a rival during a congressional antitrust hearing earlier this week, at which Microsoft was noticeably absent.</p><p>TikTok has tried in recent months to convince U.S. users and regulators of its strong ties to the country. It emphasizes that it has hundreds of employees in the United States and even hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer to be its new chief executive in May.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mayer pledged the company will allow U.S. regulators and privacy experts to take a closer look under its digital hood, offering them the ability to \"examine\" its underlying software code in response to claims it is handing off data to the Chinese government.</p><p>The app, which lets users create and post short videos with music and other effects, has surged in popularity even more during the coronavirus pandemic as people search for at-home activities and distractions. Teens are especially active on TikTok, creating videos showcasing their dancing, pranks and cooking skills.</p><p>This is the latest in a string of moves by the Trump administration to counter Chinese tech giants.</p><p>Tension has already come to a head over Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the world's largest provider of mobile network gear - a field from which U.S. companies are largely absent. The United States calls Huawei a security risk, which the company denies, and has undertaken an international lobbying campaign to persuade other countries not to buy from Huawei.</p><p>The Trump administration has also targeted other Chinese companies, restricting trade with more than a dozen it accuses of supplying surveillance gear in the western province of Xinjiang, where U.S. officials and human rights groups say China's ruling Communist Party is holding Muslims in mass detention camps.</p><p>The Trump administration has also previously used CFIUS to scrutinize, block or reverse Chinese acquisitions.</p><p>In March, Trump ordered a Chinese company to divest all ownership of a U.S. hotel-software company, saying the Beijing investor could harm U.S. national security. A written order from the president's office suggested the administration was concerned about Chinese access to StayNTouch's hotel guest data.</p><p>The order, which followed a CFIUS review, instructed the Chinese company to immediately refrain from accessing any of StayNTouch's hotel guest data.</p><p>The Chinese company, Beijing Shiji Information Technology, acquired StayNTouch in 2018, saying the U.S. company's software was used in connection with 90,000 hotel rooms globally.</p><p>After the order was issued, Beijing Shiji said it was \"not a threat to U.S. security in any way.\"</p><p>\"We offered a range of significant proposals to mitigate any concerns the U.S. government might have, including further restricting access to guest data and appointing an independent monitor to ensure these protections. Unfortunately, those offers were rebuffed,\" the company said at the time.</p><p>In 2018, after a CFIUS review, Trump ordered Singapore-based Broadcom to abandon its $117 billion bid for the U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm, blocking what would have been one of the biggest technology deals in history.</p><p>A full presidential order is not always required to block or reverse a deal. Lawyers familiar with CFIUS reviews say the national security committee can tell a foreign company: Sell the asset or the president will issue an order.</p><p>That appears to be what happened last year, when the Trump administration forced a Chinese company to sell its majority stake in a U.S. health-care data company, PatientsLikeMe.</p><p>When Pompeo said last month that TikTok might be banned, frantic users took to the app to bemoan its potential demise and urge followers to find them on other social media sites.</p><p>\"I really hope that this will not happen,\" one user said in a video. \"All the videos, all the memories of you. This can't be true.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ellen.nakashima@washpost.com\">ellen.nakashima@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rachel.lerman@washpost.com\">rachel.lerman@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jeanne.whalen@washpost.com\">jeanne.whalen@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-65d9aa1ad38711ea8c5561e7fa5e82ab</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GN-RW81-JCDY-T0NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1506\"/><timeReceived>3:49 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

One said the content has gone through many changes and hasn't been finalized.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If the internet is going to be presented as this egalitarian platform and most of Twitter is liberal cesspools of venom, then at least the president wants some fairness in the system,\" the White House official reportedly said.</p><p>\"But look, we also think that social media plays a vital role. They have a vital role and an increasing responsibility to the culture that has helped make them so profitable and so prominent.\"</p><p>A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, pointed The Epoch Times to Trump's comments during the recent social media summit, where he promised to address the tech bias issue and said the administration is exploring all policy solutions.</p><p>Mostly conservative content creators were invited to the July 11 White House event, including PragerU, the Heritage Foundation, Turning PointUSA, the Media Research Center, and Project Veritas.</p><p>Many of the attendees have previously reported that they were censored by tech platforms, or have highlighted the issue of political censorship of their work.</p><p>\"I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans,\" Trump said at the event. \"That's you people in this room and a lot of people out there.\"</p><p>He said the administration hopes to see \"transparency, more accountability, and more freedom\" for \"both sides.\"</p><p>\"You could be some of the most liberal people in the world in this audience, and that's okay. I don't care. But we're talking about for everybody,\" he said. \"Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people.\"</p><p>Internal documents, interviews with insiders, and hidden camera footage-the bulk of which was published by Project Veritas-have shown that companies that include Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Pinterest suppress content using vague, often secret criteria that reflect the political preferences of the companies.</p><p>\"They're playing with a lot of minds, and they're playing unfairly,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump has previously come to the defense of several conservative figures banned by social media platforms.

One said the content has gone through many changes and hasn't been finalized.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If the internet is going to be presented as this egalitarian platform and most of Twitter is liberal cesspools of venom, then at least the president wants some fairness in the system,\" the White House official reportedly said.</p><p>\"But look, we also think that social media plays a vital role. They have a vital role and an increasing responsibility to the culture that has helped make them so profitable and so prominent.\"</p><p>A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, pointed The Epoch Times to Trump's comments during the recent social media summit, where he promised to address the tech bias issue and said the administration is exploring all policy solutions.</p><p>Mostly conservative content creators were invited to the July 11 White House event, including PragerU, the Heritage Foundation, Turning PointUSA, the Media Research Center, and Project Veritas.</p><p>Many of the attendees have previously reported that they were censored by tech platforms, or have highlighted the issue of political censorship of their work.</p><p>\"I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans,\" Trump said at the event. \"That's you people in this room and a lot of people out there.\"</p><p>He said the administration hopes to see \"transparency, more accountability, and more freedom\" for \"both sides.\"</p><p>\"You could be some of the most liberal people in the world in this audience, and that's okay. I don't care. But we're talking about for everybody,\" he said. \"Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people.\"</p><p>Internal documents, interviews with insiders, and hidden camera footage-the bulk of which was published by Project Veritas-have shown that companies that include Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Pinterest suppress content using vague, often secret criteria that reflect the political preferences of the companies.</p><p>\"They're playing with a lot of minds, and they're playing unfairly,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump has previously come to the defense of several conservative figures banned by social media platforms. In May, the White House set up a website where people can file reports if they believe their social media accounts have been banned, suspended, or otherwise affected because of political bias.</p><p>The website had received 16,000 responses by the time of the summit, Trump said.</p><p>What Could Happen</p><p>While the U.S. government is bound by the First Amendment not to regulate speech, except in extreme situations, such as incitement to imminent lawless action, private companies are not. However, there are ways the government can nudge these companies in the right direction.</p><p>Online platforms are shielded from liability for content created by their users under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.</p><p>Some Republican lawmakers have argued that social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter have gone so far in restricting, filtering, and sorting users' content on their platforms that they should be treated as publishers of that information, and thus be liable for it.</p><p>Trump already issued an executive order that directs colleges to protect free speech on campus if they want to draw on federal research grants.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Bringing the closing bell on Wall Street, trading is over. We have records for all three of the major indices. The Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P 500. When it comes to Bob Shiller, it doesn't matter how heavy he hits the gavel, it's a strong gavel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trading is over on Monday, October 16th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight records all around in the stock market as Donald Trump says he can still pass tax cuts this year. Atlanta's Fed president says not everyone is feeling the recovery. An exclU.S.ive interview with President Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed.</p><p>And lights, camera, earnings. Netflix results are due out any minute. We will bring them to you. The stock is up on in the exchange.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest, today live from the CNN Center where of course I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. The market records are tumbling even as the head of the Atlanta Fed is warning that many people are not sharing the benefits. Tonight the three major U.S. averages close out records. As you can see the Dow is inching ever closer to the 23,000 market, may well happen this week. It's only 40 points over.</p><p>And looming over it all President Donald Trump. This afternoon the president touted the market gains. Some 5.7 trillion since election day as strong business confidence and GDP growth. Remember GDP growth in the second quarter was 3 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile the Atlanta Fed president says he's not focused on Washington or presidential tweets. Raphael Bostic is listening to the people in his district and their fears, and chief among them is the power of automation and driverless cars and the sharing economy.</p><p>All of that to destroy the jobs. The Atlanta Fed president, Mr. Bostic, is one of the newest presidents and he says the record high share prices that we're seeing in the market mask a bleak economic reality for many Americans.</p><p>The Atlanta Fed district covers a huge part of the American southeast. It's a diverse area and the Atlanta Fed says that diversity goes to the heart of the mission.</p><p>Raphael Bostic is the first black governor of one of the Fed's regional banks in the institutions, 140-year history. At the moment he isn't a voting member of the Interest Rate Setting Committee. That changes in January. It's only like the rest of the Fed is looking at the data to make policy decisions. And I suggested data is ambiguous.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RAPHAEL BOSTIC, ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT: I think there are really two to things going on. On one hand, there are many measures that are telling us that the labor markets are tight, growth is happening at a robust phase, and businesses are really starting to invest in ways that suggest there's going to be upward pressure on prices.</p><p>So I think that that's all in the strong economy. We should be trying to make sure that we navigate that space so things don't get too out of hand. But then you have, on the other hand, this inflation issue, and the inflation has been stubbornly low. Lower than I think most people on the on the board would expect, and so we are anticipating, we're continually waiting for the tightness and the strength of the economy to reflect itself on market prices. And that's not happening as robustly as one might expect.</p><p>QUEST: And in that environment, are you in the camp that believes there should be more wait-and-see or let's move, albeit incrementally and slowly, sooner rather than later? Are you a wait-and-seer or sooner-rather-than- later?</p><p>BOSTIC: I think I'm actually partly in between those two. I'm taking away this attitude because I definitely am concerned that the weakness in inflation is a sign that labor markets might be -- have more slack than you might expect. It may even be weakening to some extent. Absent that I'm comfortable with an incremental growth, so -- but I'm not so wedded to it that if I didn't see a lot of times that that the labor markets were continuing on their path I wouldn't say let's just hold up.</p><p>QUEST: So if you take the numbers and you take the anecdotal evidence, and you take the reporting from your various brunches, does that shift your position?</p><p>BOSTIC: I think it has informed my position to a place where I feel the economy is performing well, that labor markets are tight, and they are tightening significantly.</p><p>[16:05:10] In that environment I am expecting that there will be signs of inflation that start to appear. And in that case I think the course that the Fed has been on is a prudent one. And --</p><p>QUEST: So when the doc plots suggests one more before the end of the year, you'd go along with that?</p><p>BOSTIC: At this point I'm comfortable with that but to start where you started, you know, I'm going to wait and let the data show me that that trajectory is one that works.</p><p>QUEST: The idea that you get these comments from the White House, let's firstly, you know, cutting -- that the rising stock market will cut government debt and that cut in the corporation tax will boost the economy for everybody.</p><p>These trained economists seem to be non-sequiturs.</p><p>BOSTIC: Well, what I will say is this, I let Washington be Washington. You know, one of things I try to do in my job is really talk clearly to the businesses in my district to the consumers in my district about what we're seeing on the ground and on how the economy appears to be working. I -- the people don't ask -- people do ask me a lot about, so what do you think about this tweet or that tweet, I don't spend a lot of time going tweet to tweet.</p><p>I know the media does a lot of that. To me that's somewhat of a distraction. Really where I'm trying to get to is a place where, you know, we talk in a clear voice about how the economy is evolving in real times and one of the things I'm trying to do for us as an institution is really help people see how they might have a role in this evolving account.</p><p>There's been a lot of change that's happened. And I think that there's a lot of fear in the marketplace that we all need to be mindful of so that the American household, the consumer is comfortable, and starts to make productive investments in our economy.</p><p>QUEST: What's that fear?</p><p>BOSTIC: I think the fear is really that frankly their job today may not be here in two years. We've seen a lot of disruption that's occurred in positions and sectors of the economy such as everyone goes to the grocery store now, you see automated checkout. We hear about driverless cars on automated vehicles. That is a threat to a significant portion of the driving economy, truck drivers and the like. You have Airbnb and Uber that have put at risk other sectors of the economy and I think people --</p><p>QUEST: And we haven't even started yet in terms of artificial intelligence and all the things that people say are coming down the road.</p><p>BOSTIC: And these are all things people know, right, and so the fear is that, you know, their position today or my position today may not be there tomorrow, and I don't know what to do about it. And I don't know what my options are and I think frankly they're not hearing a lot of conversation in that space and I think that's where we need to get to. And much more take where we are today and before looking and trying to give people guidance on how they might position themselves best to take advantage of opportunities.</p><p>QUEST: OK. So I'm glad you took me to this area because I said you wanted to raise it. Are today's policymakers both on the monetary -- on the Central Bank side and on the administration side, and we can take any country, all you all prepared and equipped to deal with what we are told is going to be the biggest -- tsunami workplace changes since the Industrial Revolution? Are you even thinking grand thoughts at this point?</p><p>BOSTIC: We -- all I can talk about is our bank. And we definitely are -- just two weeks ago we started a new initiative that we would call a new center, the Center on Workforce and Economic Opportunity, and the whole goal there is to try to get our institutions to orient themselves in a way that serves Americans so that they can get the skills of tomorrow's economy. So to answer your question, I think there's more that needs to be done. I think that the scale that we're talking about is going to require a massive investment and tremendous focus and energy, and we're trying to start that in our bank now to move forward and try to move forward as effectively as possible.</p><p>QUEST: The stock market rises, and continues to rise, and indeed the tweet de jure from the president's talks about a $5.7 trillion increase in value and how this is good for economic growth. He does create a wealth effect, economists will agree. Are you concerned that the stock market has gotten out of kilter with the real economy now?</p><p>[16:10:02] BOSTIC: So let me go in two ways on this. So, one, it does create a wealth effect and we also know, though, that for many Americans, they're not in the stock market. So as a wealth effect that is really focused in a certain (INAUDIBLE) and a lot of folks are left out. There have been reports in the last couple of months about how many American families can't handle a $400 or $500 shot to their balance sheet, their emergency came up they would be in a really difficult place.</p><p>So I think -- I think that we need to first be mindful that, you know, the stock market is reflective of an experience for some parts, but many folks really don't enjoy and benefit in that.</p><p>QUEST: Do you worry about the politicization of Fed?</p><p>BOSTIC: It is vital that our institution be viewed as an independent arbitrator of policy in the monetary space. The long run in this country operates most beneficially when policymakers don't worry about the headlines from day-to-day because that kind of approach will lead policy to swing in pretty dramatic ways and that doesn't serve our economy or the businesses that rely on making long-term investments.</p><p>So to me, I worry about the appointments aside anything that we do that we make sure that it's couched in terms of our view and I'll tell you from my perspective that I was an Obama appointee, but right now I'm in the Federal Reserve and even if I had been a Trump appointee, I would be approaching this in exactly the same way.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: President Bostic talking to me earlier.</p><p>Now being a Fed president I didn't -- of course they distribute dollar bills to all the south east of the United States. I not surprisingly asked if they had any free samples of these that they were able to give me. After all free samples, you know, giveaways, dollar bills. And imagine my surprise when the president said, oh yes, we have some free samples of dollars that we can give you. And then this is what he gave me.</p><p>Yes, real dollar bills that have been shredded because that's the other thing that they do at the Fed. They take old one of these and turn them into these.</p><p>No more samples for me.</p><p>To Wall Street now where they pick a sample of all was the way the Dow Jones Industrials rose. Look at that. That's 85, record on the Dow, the Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Peter Tuchman at Quattro Securities joins me now.</p><p>No samples of dollar bills for you, shredded or otherwise. But this market shredded its way to a record.</p><p>PETER TUCHMAN, QUATTRO SECURITIES: Yes, it absolutely did. First of all, Richard, that was a great interview with the Fed representative. That was just so informative for me. Watching the market the way I do and talking to you regularly.</p><p>We are at record highs here, Richard, and it feels like we're going to just keep going higher. You know, I know that gentleman was talking about the state of the economy and that not everybody in this population benefits from this market.</p><p>But the bottom line is we're talking about the market. Those who are in it, and those who are in it are benefiting in a big way and the market is going higher, inching its way to a record. Today was a record, tomorrow will be 23,000, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: But how much of this is a few stocks leading the way? We look at the S&amp;P which causes a more representative. How much of it is that is the -- not just the big tech, the Apple, the Alphabet, the Netflix, rather than a broad based with construction, with mining, with industrials following on?</p><p>TUCHMAN: OK. So there's always going to be some sectors that do not follow the market. Right? We're always good to see that. But this market -- we're talking about a market at 23,000, Richard. We see the S&amp;P up five handle today. The Dow up 90 so you're seeing a broad-based rally, you know. The S&amp;P was upsetting the Dow. The Dow can be off on a couple of stocks like a contractor like a Boeing or a Pfizer or something.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>TUCHMAN: But if you've got the S&amp;P up as big as it is over the last number on months.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>TUCHMAN: And you're seeing -- I mean, the only thing that suffered today I think were the transports, and I think that was a little consolidation from that huge week and that record we had last week.</p><p>QUEST: Got it.</p><p>TUCHMAN: On the transports for the airlines and the car companies going higher. But this market is very real. It's real money.</p><p>QUEST: It's up.</p><p>TUCHMAN: It's up, up and away, I don't know. I don't think it's really wanted to socks. I think it's the tech stocks, that's for sure.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>TUCHMAN: I think it's the S&amp;P , it's the Dow, it's the market. This is real money --</p><p>QUEST: That's real money.</p><p>[16:15:02] TUCHMAN: This is real money, Richard. It's shredded dollar bills.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, well, let's --</p><p>TUCHMAN: These are hundreds, buddy.</p><p>QUEST: Let's see the real money out of your wallet when I get back.</p><p>Peter Tuchman, thank you, sir.</p><p>TUCHMAN: Come and visit me soon, Richard. Good to see you.</p><p>QUEST: Across the European bosses it was a mix and they haven't really seen the best Spanish stocks, but again on uncertainty over Catalonia, you'll see in a moment or two why. The Ibex is up three quarters of 1 percent. Otherwise (INAUDIBLE) was down, but Papyrus and Frankfurt, those markets were both up.</p><p>Now two tense political standoffs in Europe are set to shape the future of the continent. I want you to watch very closely as I go to look at them in some detail. First of all Catalonian leaders still won't confirm whether they officially declared independence. Madrid is demanding clarification. The government says it's new deadline is now Thursday. It was Saturday.</p><p>The Spanish prime minister has asked Catalonia in his words to go back to legality in his words. Spain could impose direct roll into Article 155 from Madrid suspending Catalonia's autonomy if Puigdemont, the Catalonia authorities don't given an answer.</p><p>And then the other one, Brussels, Europe's big confrontation between the UK and the EU. The British prime minister is now agreeing to try to accelerate Brexit talks. The European Commission head, Jean Claude Junker. Downing Street denies that the trip to Brussels is a panic reaction as, say, after Brexit talk deadlocked. The former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, told CNN, foreign investment in the UK is collapsing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK CLEGG, FORMER BRITISH DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: The United Kingdom rely, as an economy, on foreign direct investments more than any other mature economy in the developed world. And we are basically saying to investors in board rooms in Tokyo, in Washington, elsewhere, you know what, we're so at sixes and sevens ourselves, you shouldn't put our money here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So Bianca Nobilo is in Brussels for us tonight.</p><p>Bianca, this idea of deadlock from last week's press conference, is there a tangible shift in UK policy and movement?</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN PRODUCER: What is different at the moment is this flurry of activity. The UK has never tried harder to try and make sure that there's progress in these Brexit negotiations. Today before Theresa May flew to Brussels to have dinner her with Michelle Bonnier and Junker in the building behind me, she made calls to Macron. She made calls to the Irish leader.</p><p>On Sunday Boris Johnson was meeting with all of his EU foreign minister counterparts, trying to drum up some goodwill, trying to get them to want to be at that next stage where they can talk about transition and they can talk about trade deal. So there is a bit of a shift.</p><p>QUEST: But there's still the problem of the Brexit bill, the divorce bill. There's still the issue of citizens rights, which the prime minister said last week they were very close to settling. And there's still Northern Island which is not believed to be the ultimate stocking block.</p><p>On the bill the amount of money, where do we stand?</p><p>NOBILO: There's definitely an impasse when it comes to the bill and in fact I was a bit disappointed that this dinner happened in this building behind me, not at a restaurant, because I think it would have been quite interesting to look at. He was paying the bill in that group of four people that were meeting tonight. But on the UK side there's definitely a reticence to pay the numbers that the EU have been talking about which is up to 90 billion.</p><p>Theresa May and her government haven been talking at about 20 billion and also that they'll continue to honor that commitment to the EU. But the EU doesn't look likely to budge on that. Bearing in mind also that there has been a ramping up in the UK of discussions about preparing for a new scenario. Brexiteers and members of Theresa May's own government want to see those preparations in place. So that if that bill is too high, it's possible for the UK to crash out of the EU.</p><p>So it's at a very difficult stage at the moment, the people in the EU wanting that 90 billion figure with people in the UK wanting to prepare for pay nothing and to crash out.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Bianca Nobilo, thank you in Brussels.</p><p>When we come back, a new release from Netflix tonight. Critics are expecting a blockbuster. If they don't have a blockbuster with earnings, the market will tank. All these Netflix stocks, but that doesn't seem to be the way it's going at the moment.</p><p>[16:21:38] QUEST: Netflix has just delivered a stunning performance in the last few moments. Its third quarter earnings that handily beat Wall Street expectations on revenue and subscriber growth. It comes with the details in just a moment. Let's look at the biggest hit so far. There's a bit of a glow around the company. As you might say, JPMorgan raised its target price for the stock on Friday and that's driven shares to a record level. Just looking at the price of Netflix at the moment. Over $202 a share at the moment. A gain of 2 percent just on any after-hours trading.</p><p>It's encouraged ethics to say (INAUDIBLE) back off, as you might say. Disney is already planning to steal the crown. However, Disney share price is down while Netflix is up. And Disney's best plan is to take shows away from Netflix and open its own streaming in its own right.</p><p>Paul La Monica, good old La Monica is with me from New York, and the numbers on Netflix you had about 10 minutes to digest what struck out for you at most?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: The subscriber growth continues to really impress, Richard. They now have over 109 million subscribers worldwide and that was better than expected. The company says they think they'll add more than six million in the current quarter, that will bring them to more than 115 million worldwide.</p><p>So I think that really is the key thing despite a lot of competition is Netflix just continues to show that they have the content that people want to, you know, talk about one of the show titles, \"Black is the New Black.\" It's a very profitable company and that's why Wall Street loves it right now.</p><p>QUEST: And the issue of course is -- or not the issue, I mean, the point people keep making is, let's take Facebook with its $2 billion however many users it's got. And then you look at NetflixNetflix as it grows into nationally and it's only 115 million. It hasn't really got going in many European countries, Asian countries as well. Everything I hear is that even at these levels the risk is low. But the upside is great.</p><p>LA MONICA: I think that might be the case. There clearly are some who wonder whether or not Netflix as a stock is overvalued but I think a lot of people do feel that there is room for growth internationally. I'd be cautious about drawing around the comparison between Facebook and Netflix with users because let's be honest here, it's one thing to subscribe for free to Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp. It's quite another to spend your couple of bucks a month for a subscription service like Netflix, so it is very impressive that you have 109 million paying customers. Because not really sure, though, that many people out there paying for Facebook.</p><p>QUEST: No. But if you take Facebook's PE at about 37 and you take Netflix at 248, I can see the argument that says Netflix is unduly frothy particularly when you take for example an Amazon, a 253. So there we are.</p><p>Thank you, Paul La Monica.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you very much, sir.</p><p>QUEST: I told because they're about making money and they're not really showing proper profits, or these substantial profits for the size of the company.</p><p>Paul, thank you.</p><p>BlackBerry executive says the company now has a purpose as a major player in cyber security.</p><p>[16:25:08] The company that once led the way into smartphones demonstrates its new ambition. It rang the Opening Bell at the New York Stock Exchange and transferred its stock listing from the Nasdaq. BlackBerry is at the NYSE. Shares tumbled on the first day. It's around one and three-quarter percent down but just not price of $11.37. $11 and change is so dramatically higher than when it was languishing in the low digits.</p><p>Maggie Lake asked chief executive John Chen what the switch to the big board says about the brand.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN CHEN, CEO, BLACKBERRY: I feel the company now has a purpose. And I think that's the most -- you know, we now know what we want to do. We want to be a major player in cyber security, especially one that's related to mobile, not only mobile but especially on any related mobile. So we bought ourselves time to execute our strategy and so I think the brand is now much stronger. Moving here to -- stock exchange time is also an attempt and one of the effort to kind of re-launch the bread.</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNN ANCHOR: What part of the world do you see the best opportunity? And we talk a lot about the political risks, a lot of uncertainty there, a lot of regulation worrying, a lot of tech companies. It seems these phases you've chosen are a little bit away from that worry. Where do you see the biggest potential? Are you big in Asia, you're pushing in Asia? Is it still North America?</p><p>CHEN: Interesting enough, so far the business have been going well in Europe.</p><p>LAKE: And that is not a place people would say is leading the global economic recovery.</p><p>CHEN: But they are leading the needs for security. And so --</p><p>LAKE: Pushed by the government?</p><p>CHEN: Pushed by the government, pushed by policy that -- like the GDRP but the -- you know, the UK government's policy on privacy on data sharing and all that.</p><p>LAKE: Which tells me you're still pragmatic. When you took this job on when everyone thought you were dead, and you've been very consistent and calm and pragmatic. Not making big promises and really making that pivot. Investors are paying attention. Your shares have been on fire. Your profitable. People are taking notice.</p><p>What's the biggest challenge? I've got to think when you're facing that kind of growth, it's got to be a war for talent? Can you retract people that you need to kind of engineer as you need to say, oh no, don't got work for Google, don't go work for Microsoft, come work for BlackBerry. Do you have that brand restoration back to be able to do that?</p><p>CHEN: Great question, work in progress but it's getting better every day and because like you said, the story is catching on. Our stock prices are still low. You know they don't come in with a stock option of $198 a share.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>CHEN: They come in with a stock option of $11 a share. There's a lot of reliever that say, hey, I think we could go places. It's easy to see $11 shares stumble than $198 stumble. You know, I'm not suggesting --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHEN: Is that a good --</p><p>LAKE: No promise --</p><p>CHEN: Yes, so. But I think we can attract a lot of time. Being a Canadian company and have operation around the world, actually helps, too. So a little bit. Not a huge because, you know, we're kind of the anchor in the Waterloo area. And so we were able to do that and also where we were able to so there's a lot of things that we -- but we still need to work it. We still need to work hard.</p><p>LAKE: And you're committed to staying in the role as CEO? A lot of times we see a turnaround, people feel like when they've righted the ship they're going to give it up to somebody else.</p><p>CHEN: Well, that's a tough question to answer. I am very committed to the company. I signed a five-year agreement. This is public news.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>CHEN: I signed a five-year agreement. I'm -- I got one year and --</p><p>LAKE: Which is very timely.</p><p>CHEN: Right. The question is --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHEN: You're the first one to ask in this kind of media setting, so, you know, this is something that the board and I need to work out.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: John Chen. I'm not quite sure whether he did admit to otherwise as is often. It doesn't sound like he is certain with the share price having, it's a good deal for him.</p><p>When we return not long ago Donald Trump blamed Mitch Connell for the failure of the healthcare bill. Now the president says he's closer than ever before to the Senate leader as they hope for a win on tax reform.</p><p>[16:31:50] RICHARD QUEST, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment from the CNN Center. And one of the most Trump's closest allies is helping the Weinstein Company get a buy pay lock (ph), and I'll speak to the president of Atlanta United Football Club, already a hotter (ph) ticket from most European teams. All that at the CNN and don't miss that. The (ph) news always comes first.</p><p>A double truck bombing in Mogadishu has now claimed more than 300 lives. It makes it the deadliest attack in Somalia's modern history. The death toll has been rising as crews pull more bodies from the rubble and the victims die from their injuries.</p><p>Al-Shabaab has been blamed for the bloodshed. The organization's not yet admitted the murders.</p><p>Officials say wildfires in Portugal and Spain have killed at least 39 people and injured dozens of people. Thousands of firefighters on the blinds (ph) battling 150 blazes at least. Strong warm winds from home of (ph) Hurricane Ophelia and the flames have now calmed a bit with the second series of deadly fires in the Iberian Peninsula for this year.</p><p>And Ophelia, which has been downgraded to a post tropical storm has battered much of Ireland, but the authorities say at least three storm related deaths have happened, 360,000 homes and businesses all without power. Storms now dumping heavy rain on parts of the United Kingdom.</p><p>Two Peshmerga sources say at least 16 Kurdish fighters are dead as Iraqi forces retake the distribution intensity (ph) of Kirkuk. Iraqi military operations have plunged (ph) the Kurdish Independence Movement is putting two U.S. allies against each other. The Kurdish flag has now come down from the governor's building, and then (ph) the Iraqi flag is flying.</p><p>President Trump has kicked off a new week trying to get things moving on his tax reform plans, and he did so by criticizing the very senators he needs to get it passed. He was speaking after a meeting with the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, President Trump said they were close to never before earlier in front of his cabinet. The president absolved himself of any blame for the fact that no health care reform is being passed in his administration.</p><p>And instead, he pointed the finger at his own party.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have -- you know, despite what the press writes, I have great relationships with actually many senators but, in particular, with most Republican senators. But we're not getting the job done. And I'm not going to blame myself, I'll be honest. They are not getting the job done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Phil Mattingly joins me from Capitol Hill. Phil, so, he's not taking the blame for maybe he's -- not what he did or not doing to health care. How accurate is this idea that he and Mitch McConnell are NBFs (ph)?</p><p>[16:35:03] PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Look, what's interesting is almost the whiplash mystery solver (ph), but of course, mystery hour period where he came out and said that he blamed not himself but several Republican senators for the failure of health care. And then a couple hours later, he's standing side by side with the Senate Majority Leader who he's sparred with over the course of the last couple of weeks, repeatedly behind closed doors I'm told, mocked Mr. McConnell's physical appearance, how he operates and had kind of a kumbaya moment with him.</p><p>And I think that is kind of a great way of encapsulating the actual overall relationship between the president and the Republican Senate Conference. Senators don't know where he's going to be on any given day. There are a lot of people to blame for why health care failed, the president is certainly among them, no question about that.</p><p>And as they move on to a huge agenda item like tax reform, something that's going to really take a concerted, united effort kind of every single day for the next couple of months, there's no question that unity is the way to go about it, not pointing fingers.</p><p>QUEST: OK. Talk me through, because here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we are going to be watching this tax reform package with an intensity. So talk me through how this was solved, because there isn't actually a fully-fledged plan on the table yet, is there?</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes, that's exactly right. Look, we have a nine-page framework, that's it. And you think about what a tax reform bill is actually going to look like particularly if it's a full reform package, which is what's they're still pledging to do, not just tax cuts. It's going to be hundreds, if not, thousands of pages.</p><p>So we have top-lined agreements on the corporate rate, 20%. On the pasture (ph) rate, 25% that they will be shrinking down the brackets from seven to three or maybe four depending on what they want to do with the upper bracket. That's what we know. What we don't know is the details and here's why. They still have kind of a multi-step procedural process to go and I won't bore you with the Senate procedure which makes everybody more or less want to fall asleep.</p><p>But the reality is, is the procedure is very important particularly if Republicans want to pass this with just this simple majority vote. They're going through a similar process they went through on health care, which means they're going to have to pass a budget resolution likely this week, then they'll have to go through the committee process and actually draft the bill.</p><p>Rich, we won't see actual legislative language, probably, for another three or four weeks. And so, the idea that everybody is unified around nine pages or general frameworks or concepts, that's great for the Republican Party. Certainly, that's a big first step for them.</p><p>But as you know as well anybody, better than anybody, tax reform is in the details, its specific provisions that have specific impacts on specific companies that reside in specific backyards of specific senators, and specific members of the House. And until we see those details, we won't really know how harder heavy of a lift this is going --</p><p>QUEST: OK.</p><p>MATTINGLY: -- to be. The reality is, they haven't done this for 31 years for a reason.</p><p>QUEST: And, how difficult -- let's put aside the individual, you know, bit of the policy, the pork barrel politics of it, on a matter of philosophy, how difficult will it be for the right wing and the center ground of the Republican Party to remain unified in the Senate.</p><p>MATTINGLY: It's complicated, no question about it. I think -- look, when you talk to leaders of the Republican Party, they say, hey, unlike health care, at least we're more unified on general conservative concepts going into tax reform. We all believe in tax cuts. We all believe the tax cuts create growth at least to some degree. But there's differences on how much they believe tax cuts do create growth. There's differences on how many senators believe that you should be able to have a tax cut and not pay for it at all and accept -- or expect that economic growth will try and fill in that gap and others who remain deficit hoaxed (ph) to this day.</p><p>I think the idea on the general concept that people agree, Richard, that's accurate. But as you dig into the details, as you dig in --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>MATTINGLY: -- to even the pork barrel, things like that, that's where splits come to pass and that's those splits you're going to see in the next couple of weeks, which will be extremely important.</p><p>QUEST: I look forward to the final bail and you and I can pass it (ph) line by line over a drink. Phil Mattingly, I think it'd be very long drink. Thank you, Phil, good to see you.</p><p>One of President Trump's closest friends is giving a lifeline to the Weinstein Company, Tom Barrack, founder of Colony Capital says he's pleased to invest in the embattled Hollywood studio, how much Colony is putting in hasn't been discussed.</p><p>Colony is also in talk about possibly buying all or most of the company. And a short time ago, the board of Producers Guild voted to expel Harvey Weinstein from the guild.</p><p>CNN Reporter Hadas Gold joins me from New York. So, we've got here two elements, you got the Producers Guild which is really falling after (ph) and the academy and you got the company itself, which is now up for sale, which is I want to extend (ph) Bob Weinstein said just a matter of 72 hours ago. On Friday, he specifically said, we're not selling the company.</p><p>When you get that sort of -- I was going to say, lying but hypocrisy (ph), the discrepancy, it's difficult to plead (ph) anything that comes out from them.</p><p>[16:40:02] HADAS GOLD, CNN REPORTER: Exactly. I mean, there -- he isn't really in talk position right now. It's Bob Weinstein that's been doing interviews where he's saying that he had no idea that Harvey Weinstein, his own brother, was doing any of these inappropriate actions but he knew he was cheating on his wife.</p><p>But yes, this investment from Colony Capital, it's sort of the strange melding of stories and of world. Tom Barrack was one of the president's of the United States closest friends, rumored to be a possible next chief of staff and his company have thrown this financial lifeline to the Weinstein Company and this is really what's saving them because they are getting content and other partners dropped left and right and this is hopefully going to stabilize them. They're going to change the name of it. And they're going to hopefully keep this company afloat in some way because of this investment.</p><p>QUEST: Now, obviously, Bob Weinstein himself is, you know, a top producer in his own right. In fact --</p><p>GOLD: Right.</p><p>QUEST: -- the two of them from Miramax. So, I mean, we're sort of making it seem as if the Weinstein Company was all Harvey and no one else.</p><p>GOLD: Right (ph).</p><p>QUEST: And, yes, put me right on that, please.</p><p>GOLD: So, Harvey Weinstein was known for all of these big movies that won the Oscars and these were the series movies. But, Bob points that his brother was actually in charge of a lot of the movies that made a lot of money, including a lot of those sort of campy, scary movies that really helped infuse a lot of cash into this company. So he's an equally important part of this company and clearly right now, he is the one stirring the ship, one of the few remaining people on the board as most of them have actually resigned.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, Hadas. Thank you.</p><p>GOLD: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: We'll talk more about this, obviously, in the days (INAUDIBLE). Thank you.</p><p>The NFL star Colin Kaepernick has made headlines last summer when he knelt during the national anthem. Now, the quarterback says he's being punished for his actions.</p><p>QUEST: The American football star, Colin Kaepernick of the NFL team known as (ph), have colluded strong word there to keep them out of work has filed a grievance against the National Football League, NFL. He says he's being punished for protesting against the treatment of Black Americans particularly by police last summer, you remember, having initially sat during the national anthem. Then he started kneeling during the star's instruct (ph) registering his protest. A few moments ago, President Trump said the wave of protester (ph) on the anthem is hurting the NFL.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The people of our country are very angry at the NFL. All you have to do is look at their ratings and look at their stadiums. You see empty seats where you never saw them before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, Hines Ward is the CNN sports contributor and a two-time Super Bowl champion. He joins me now.</p><p>HINES WARD, CNN SPORTS CONTRIBUTOR: How are you doing, Rich?</p><p>QUEST: Take us through quickly with the president's --</p><p>WARD: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- the president's comments (INAUDIBLE). Is it true, all the more empty seats, all people rebelling, is there a feeling that they are against what's happening?</p><p>WARD: No, I don't think so. I mean, fans are still coming out to the game but I feel like there is division amongst fans because some fans finds it disrespectful for players to kneel during a national anthem.</p><p>[16:45:03] While other fans, they just want to go and watch a football, right, and leave politics out of it. So there's division within the stadium, what's going on with the anthem protest.</p><p>QUEST: Colin Kaepernick with his grievance, does he have merit?</p><p>WARD: I don't think so. I just -- you know, I think it's all because his skills has diminished. It's not that the fact that the owners got together and say, hey, we don't want this player because of this and that, because players are still kneeling today. You know, I just think for Colin Kaepernick, you know, it's only a handful of teams that can really bring him on to a system because you have to have an offense to cater around his skill set.</p><p>So if that's not the case --</p><p>QUEST: But there was -- god (ph), the guy was good, maybe not brilliant.</p><p>WARD: Yes, but it's --</p><p>QUEST: But there must be somebody who would take further down the lead, further down the rankings who would say, OK, so I think we can pick up (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WARD: No, no, no.</p><p>QUEST: We can get them shaped.</p><p>WARD: That would --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARD: -- but American football, you can't just plug a guy in the quarterback position and expect him to have success. And I think for a lot of owners, is it worth the distraction if he's not going to be your stars in quarterback. And I think for Colin Kaepernick, there's only a couple teams that he possibly could star for and that will be Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee Titans because they run similar style of offense that he's accustomed to running.</p><p>QUEST: He must have reasons to believe that there is this collusion, even though he pulled himself out of his last team.</p><p>WARD: Exactly.</p><p>QUEST: I mean, you know, he is the author of his own misfortune in the sense if he decided to leave.</p><p>WARD: Exactly. And I think for Colin, it's a tough place because, you know, as owners, you want to know, is he committed to playing football, or is it all in about, you know, improving the ratio and just as the (ph) social equality. So --</p><p>QUEST: Oh, you just dug out (ph), now hang on a second.</p><p>WARD: I'm just saying from my owners' perspective, that's what I'm saying. But for the quality --</p><p>QUEST: You probably (ph) have both.</p><p>WARD: No, I don't think so. I think if you're good enough to start and you're good enough to play in the league, you'll be in a league. The league -- there's many cases out there, there are players who's got off the field issues but yet they're great players and they probably some way somehow to still be playing football.</p><p>QUEST: So, in this case, is there a risk of this grievance, for lack of a better phrase, blows the issue sky high and the dirty laundry of the NFL in all its magnificent glory gets washed in public?</p><p>WARD: I don't think so. I mean, it's a privilege to play in NFL, it really is. And I think right now, the league is just trying to find, you know, how do you come together with the players, unions, the owners, to try to solve the issue with the players and the national anthem. And that's where the league is right now. They're trying to do what's best for the players and for the league without stepping on each other's toes, and that's, you know, the league -- the NFL meetings are tomorrow up in New York and I think that's something that they're going to really sit down and try to hash out.</p><p>And they're bringing in the players union something that they haven't done before to sit there and discuss the topics of what's going on in NFL.</p><p>QUEST: Brilliant. Thank you --</p><p>WARD: Anytime.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir.</p><p>WARD: Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed. We'll have you back.</p><p>WARD: Yes, anytime.</p><p>QUEST: Absolutely. You know, you can even have that done. One of them out (ph). Oh.</p><p>WARD: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's a lot bigger than we (INAUDIBLE). But then I'm looking at the vouch (ph). Atlanta's best transporting areas and the Falcons of the NFL or the braves at baseball (ph) to the game. What about Atlanta United? The local soccer team, football team players (ph), which is making its debut in MLS in a moment.</p><p>Watch these pictures and you'll see similarities to any European team but infinitely much more successful. The president of the United (INAUDIBLE) way.</p><p>[16:51:01] QUEST: There has been a spectacular takeover of the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS studio. Atlanta United is stealing with the chance of grabbing second place in the MLS Eastern Conference in their first major league soccer season. The team will finish with the regular season this weekend and a sold-out Mercedes-Benz Stadium. It's already gained a reputation as a fortress.</p><p>The club set a league record for a match attendance, more than 70,000 for the game in -- with Orlando City in September the 4th, biggest crowd for any match in the world that weekend.</p><p>Darren Eales is the president of Atlanta United who must have certain skills of reserve because he's managed to catch doom (ph) the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS sect, a completely takeover, sir.</p><p>First of all, the failure -- and let's go with the nasty a bit first.</p><p>DARREN EALES, PRESIDENT, ATLANTA UNITEDFC: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: The failure of the United States to qualify for the world champ. How much of a blow was that?</p><p>EALES: It was a real missed opportunity, I think less (ph) soccer is going from strength to strength, we've seen that with major league soccer and even our attendance for launching Arthur this year. And the league average is about 21,600 which puts it seven in global world soccer. So that's going well but this chance every four years, we also bring that thank- sitting (ph) fan into the fold as a missed opportunity. That's --</p><p>QUEST: Was it a one-off in the sense or is there something systemically wrong with U.S. soccer that will need to be fixed? Was it a bad team, bad choices, bad management or is there some -- you know, there could be replacement with the coach (INAUDIBLE), the managerial or whatever? Or does that something -- need to be something completely radically changed?</p><p>EALES: I think there's a danger in this sort of call for radical change.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>EALES: Because there's a danger of throwing the bagel out with about quarter (ph). And again, all this, my experience come from top and hot spear (ph) in England with one of the best academies in the world. When I came to Georgia in Atlanta United, the level of talent there is amazing. We hire actually three players playing to the under 17 U.S. national team who won today five males (ph) against Paraguay to get in the quarter finals.</p><p>So, things have happened over the last 10 years and are bearing fruit now and you can't expect it to happen instantly.</p><p>So, yes, though, I think there's some changes that can be made, but I do think there's a danger of saying panic stations that change everything.</p><p>QUEST: Why -- I mean, your team has been remarkably successful. And I don't say that with surprise but I say it wanting to understand why. And I don't just mean because we're business program on the beach, I'm talking about the marketing, the fan reaction, the sizes. Is it because you have modeled yourself conceptually on an English team?</p><p>EALES: Not necessarily --</p><p>QUEST: The fan base.</p><p>EALES: Yes, not model or anything to see (ph) but I think what we did do with our own Arthur Blank who started up from Depot. So, he's been there as a starter. He knew that by hiring lead two and a half years before he kicks a ball, you only get one chance to make a first impression. So we spent a lot of time focusing on the grassroots, focusing on our albeit trends (ph) and letting them be our evangelist. Let them be the people that told our stories to others and brought them into the fold. And that became this sort of snowballing momentum that got us defense that we have.</p><p>QUEST: But that's classic football club circle (ph) last century in the U.K., isn't it, in England?</p><p>EALES: Yes, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>QUEST: You know, the old terraces what people would -- you know, I'm going up, there's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>EALES: No, I think that's what we're seeing, is then carry (ph) the passion of the fan base here in America, this idea that unlike other sports, they own the game. So they had the people doing the singing and the cheering.</p><p>QUEST: But you also have cheap bit (ph), cheap hotdogs or cheap burberry (ph), cheap barrel (ph) hotdogs, you've decided to go for that as a strategy.</p><p>EALES: Yes. Look, to be honest, it's a pretty simple process, three things. We want to be competitive on the beach. We want to have the best fan engagement and we want to be in the heart of the community. And the hotdogs and to bear that pricing, it's all about trying to treat the fan fairly. So when they got this loving new stadium, we don't want to gauge (ph) them with prices like you did at the cinema, when you can't believe the price you're paying for a popcorn.</p><p>So that was part of the bigger philosophy that we run through the Falcons as well as the Atlanta United, thinking about the fan first.</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST: What's next for Atlanta United?</p><p>EALES: Well, we're trying to get a team to the playoffs as high as we can. So the white works in America (ph) is we have a playoff system, and the high we finish, the more likely we also play a home.</p><p>QUEST: FC, says FC, that stands for Football Club.</p><p>EALES: That's right, yes.</p><p>QUEST: Is --</p><p>EALES: Interesting, so when we talk to our fans, it's one of those things where they were absolutely unanimous that they wanted FC nor SC (ph). And it depends on the fan base. The art of it is, they're trying to sort of have that tradition of footballers around the world. And I think with Atlanta United, you see it now. We look and feel like a club that's been around for ages even though it's off season.</p><p>QUEST: I think tonight, I'm feeling, you know, a very expansive and generous mood, and Hines got one. I think queue (ph) since I'm visiting Atlanta. You can have one on the bell.</p><p>EALES: Oh, thanks, Rich. Oh, no, I failed it. There we go. Second time lucky. Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. (INAUDIBLE) responsibility. We'll have a Profitable Moment after the break. Can I keep this hat?</p><p>EALES: Of course, you can.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment. On this program, you heard the president of the fed, Raphael Bostic, say that, yes, the stock market has been rising sharply, but that not all Americans have been enjoying the benefits. And that goes to the heart in many ways of the disquiet and discord that exist in this country and elsewhere.</p><p>And yet to that same time, you have a president here that points out that the $5.7 trillion increase in volume, that is increased economic growth. It's an interesting conundrum that currently exist and one that certainly threatens economic growth in the future.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest at the CNN Center.

Law enforcement cannot delegate our obligations to protect the safety of the American people purely to the judgment of profit-seeking private firms,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.</p><p>The legislative changes would ensure that the internet companies' legal immunity becomes an incentive for them \u201cto be responsible actors,\" Barr said. They \u201care targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open, and competitive internet.\"</p><p>In a politically charged flourish last month, Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>Trump lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his tweets. He said the fact checks were \u201ceditorial decisions\u201d by Twitter amounting to political activism \u2014 and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for material posted on their platforms. He accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>But Trump, with an estimated 60 million followers on Twitter, has weaponized the platform to verbally eviscerate opponents and promote himself. He has long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their post</p><p>Tech industry groups have opposed the Trump initiative, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet.</p><p>The companies are granted liability protection under the 1996 Communications Decency Act because they are treated as \u201cplatforms,\u201d rather than \u201cpublishers,\u201d which can face lawsuits over content. Without that shield, companies could face lawsuits from people who feels wronged by something someone else has posted.</p><p>One of the administration\u2019s requests is that Congress strip the civil immunity protections for tech companies that may be complicit in unlawful activity on their platforms. For example, the proposal would remove the legal protection if an online platform purposefully solicited third parties to sell illegal drugs to minors, exchange sexually explicit photos or video of children or engage in other criminal activity.</p><p>The Justice Department said its proposals are aimed \u201cat incentivizing platforms to address the growing amount of illicit content online, while preserving the core of Section 230\u2019s immunity for defamation.\u201d</p><p>The administration contends that the broad immunity should not apply to companies that don\u2019t \u201crespect public safety by ensuring its ability to identify unlawful content or activity occurring on its services,\u201d according to a department memo obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>\u201cFurther, the provider must maintain the ability to assist government authorities to obtain content (i.e., evidence) in a comprehensible, readable, and usable format pursuant to court authorization (or any other lawful basis),\u201d the document says.</p><p>The big tech companies already are under close scrutiny by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. Regulators at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and a House Judiciary subcommittee, are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-806509152aedc7a6abd33f3ac6ff6d0c220200617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6055-BKH1-JC5B-G3JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><timeReceived>7:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Law enforcement cannot delegate our obligations to protect the safety of the American people purely to the judgment of profit-seeking private firms,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.</p><p>The legislative changes would ensure that the internet companies' legal immunity becomes an incentive for them \u201cto be responsible actors,\" Barr said. They \u201care targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open, and competitive internet.\"</p><p>In a politically charged flourish last month, Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>Trump lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his tweets. He said the fact checks were \u201ceditorial decisions\u201d by Twitter amounting to political activism \u2014 and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for material posted on their platforms. He accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>But Trump, with an estimated 60 million followers on Twitter, has weaponized the platform to verbally eviscerate opponents and promote himself. He has long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their post</p><p>Tech industry groups have opposed the Trump initiative, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet.</p><p>The companies are granted liability protection under the 1996 Communications Decency Act because they are treated as \u201cplatforms,\u201d rather than \u201cpublishers,\u201d which can face lawsuits over content. Without that shield, companies could face lawsuits from people who feels wronged by something someone else has posted.</p><p>One of the administration\u2019s requests is that Congress strip the civil immunity protections for tech companies that may be complicit in unlawful activity on their platforms. For example, the proposal would remove the legal protection if an online platform purposefully solicited third parties to sell illegal drugs to minors, exchange sexually explicit photos or video of children or engage in other criminal activity.</p><p>The Justice Department said its proposals are aimed \u201cat incentivizing platforms to address the growing amount of illicit content online, while preserving the core of Section 230\u2019s immunity for defamation.\u201d</p><p>The administration contends that the broad immunity should not apply to companies that don\u2019t \u201crespect public safety by ensuring its ability to identify unlawful content or activity occurring on its services,\u201d according to a department memo obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>\u201cFurther, the provider must maintain the ability to assist government authorities to obtain content (i.e., evidence) in a comprehensible, readable, and usable format pursuant to court authorization (or any other lawful basis),\u201d the document says.</p><p>The big tech companies already are under close scrutiny by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. Regulators at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and a House Judiciary subcommittee, are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-806509152aedc7a6abd33f3ac6ff6d0c220200617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6055-BB11-DYMD-61PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><timeReceived>7:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Law enforcement cannot delegate our obligations to protect the safety of the American people purely to the judgment of profit-seeking private firms,\" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.</p><p>The legislative changes would ensure that the internet companies' legal immunity becomes an incentive for them \u201cto be responsible actors,\" Barr said. They \u201care targeted at platforms to make certain they are appropriately addressing illegal and exploitive content while continuing to preserve a vibrant, open, and competitive internet.\"</p><p>In a politically charged flourish last month, Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as a bedrock for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p>Trump lashed out at Twitter for applying fact checks to two of his tweets. He said the fact checks were \u201ceditorial decisions\u201d by Twitter amounting to political activism \u2014 and that such actions should cost social media companies their liability protection for material posted on their platforms. He accused Twitter of interfering in the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>But Trump, with an estimated 60 million followers on Twitter, has weaponized the platform to verbally eviscerate opponents and promote himself. He has long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their post</p><p>Tech industry groups have opposed the Trump initiative, saying it would stifle innovation and speech on the internet.</p><p>The companies are granted liability protection under the 1996 Communications Decency Act because they are treated as \u201cplatforms,\u201d rather than \u201cpublishers,\u201d which can face lawsuits over content. Without that shield, companies could face lawsuits from people who feels wronged by something someone else has posted.</p><p>One of the administration\u2019s requests is that Congress strip the civil immunity protections for tech companies that may be complicit in unlawful activity on their platforms. For example, the proposal would remove the legal protection if an online platform purposefully solicited third parties to sell illegal drugs to minors, exchange sexually explicit photos or video of children or engage in other criminal activity.</p><p>The Justice Department said its proposals are aimed \u201cat incentivizing platforms to address the growing amount of illicit content online, while preserving the core of Section 230\u2019s immunity for defamation.\u201d</p><p>The administration contends that the broad immunity should not apply to companies that don\u2019t \u201crespect public safety by ensuring its ability to identify unlawful content or activity occurring on its services,\u201d according to a department memo obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>\u201cFurther, the provider must maintain the ability to assist government authorities to obtain content (i.e., evidence) in a comprehensible, readable, and usable format pursuant to court authorization (or any other lawful basis),\u201d the document says.</p><p>The big tech companies already are under close scrutiny by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. Regulators at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and a House Judiciary subcommittee, are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-806509152aedc7a6abd33f3ac6ff6d0c220200617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6055-B8X1-DYMD-61NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><timeReceived>7:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In May 2010, O\u2019Keefe and three others pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanor in a scheme in which they posed as telephone repairmen in Sen. Mary Landrieu\u2019s New Orleans district office.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not controversial, he\u2019s truthful,\u201d Trump insisted of O\u2019Keefe.</p><p>Playing to the friendly crowd in the East Room, Trump was at ease, joking about everything from his spelling in tweets (blaming his thumbs, not his brain, for any mistakes) to his hair (saying the rainy weather at his July 4 outdoor speech at least proved his hair was real.)</p><p>\u201cWith amazing creativity and determination, you are bypassing the corrupt establishment, and it is corrupt,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re bypassing the very, very corrupt media.\u201d</p><p>In lengthy remarks, he said: \u201cYou\u2019re challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. ... You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter.\u201d</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump\u2019s battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter, where he has an estimated 61 million followers. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \u201cagainst me\u201d and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>He announced Thursday that he is directing his administration to explore \u201call regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\u201d</p><p>And Trump said he is inviting executives from major social media platforms to join him at the White House over the next month or so.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook\u2019s lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump\u2019s volley of Twitter messages Thursday had familiar targets \u2014 \u201ccertain companies,\u201d the press and his Democratic rivals. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020.</p><p>Among the other conservative organizations participating in the White House meeting were Turning Point USA, a nonprofit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. Twitter policy prohibits paid ads with content \u201cthat is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\u201d</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry\u2019s major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \u201care the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInternet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\u201d the group\u2019s president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday. \u201cInternet companies depend upon their users\u2019 trust from across the political spectrum to grow and succeed.\u201d</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone\u2019s race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who has been sharply critical of the big companies because of their market dominance and effect on competition. He leads a House Judiciary subcommittee that has opened a bipartisan probe into the tech giants\u2019 market conduct.</p><p>\u201cIf someone wants to show me some empirical data, instead of some alt-right member\u2019s paranoid claims, I\u2019d appreciate it,\u201d Cicilline said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>Trump uses Twitter almost daily to speak directly to his followers. He has a knack for tweeting outrageous, divisive or tongue-in-cheek missives that spur frenzied reactions from the mainstream press.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has accused Twitter, without evidence, of making it \u201cvery hard for people to join me\u201d and \u201cvery much harder for me to get out the message.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">President Donald Trump speaks during the Presidential Social Media Summit Thursday at the White House in Washington.

It wasn't always like this. Once, millions flocking together to forge a new Colossus, America. This hour, it's a new reality. The American President going all in with straight up racist attacks. His message if you're here and don't like it, leave. And if you're coming, well, don't.</p><p>If you think he's alone in thinking that, he's not. Around the world there are some 70 million people, often forced to flee their homes only to find themselves shunned, abused, attacked. Connecting you to a truly global story. We are doing what it says on the tin.</p><p>This is CONNECT THE WORLD with me, Becky Anderson. Well it's 7:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi, 11:00 a.m. in Washington.</p><p>And let's start there. Where Donald Trump is at it again this morning. He's ignoring what's been a fierce backlash over his racist remarks about four Democratic women of color. In fact, doubling down on the insults and name calling, accusing the lawmakers of, quote, filthy statements and lies.</p><p>The U.S. President insists he doesn't have a racist bone in his body, according to him. And he is standing by his tweet that said the Congress women all American citizens should, quote, go back to where they came from. One of them, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a response saying, Mr. Trump can't handle America's enshrined tradition of dissent. Adding, quote, we don't leave the things we love.</p><p>In some Republicans have now criticized the President for his blatantly racist remarks. Others though are basically shrugging their shoulders. Saying things like the President's going to tweet what he tweets. Well we'll soon see who is willing to go on record. House Democrats are expected to introduce a resolution today condemning Mr. Trump's remarks. They say they hope it unites lawmakers across party lines.</p><p>I want to bring in senior Washington correspondent Joe Johns and Congressional reporter Lauren Fox. And I'll come to you in a moment on what's going on in the House. But let me start with you, Joe. Critics argue this is a little late but we are now seeing and hearing some Republican lawmakers coming out in not defense necessarily of these women but at least suggesting that Donald Trump needs to reign in his language.</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: That's true, and we do sort of have multiple things happening now on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue. On one hand we have a member of the Senate leadership, Joni Ernst, essentially saying that she disagrees. That she does think, in fact, that the President's remarks on Twitter are racist.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is a continuing push in the House of Representatives -- as you mentioned -- as a move towards that vote on the resolution condemning the President's language. And of course, they're trying to get as many votes in support of this as possible. While at the same time, the President now clearly on Twitter pushing back, in that tweet you mentioned a moment ago. Saying that Republicans should not show weakness and fall into what he refers to as their trap. He says this should be a vote on the filthy language, The Statements and lies told by the Democrats.</p><p>So the President is urging members of his own party in the House of Representatives not to vote for this resolution condemning his language. While also in that tweet, the other thing that I think that's important is, this is really the President's first direct explicit denial that the language he used was racist. Where he says those tweets were not racist, I don't have a racist bone in my body, the so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game as he put it. So those are some of the moving pieces of all this right now, but the big event is as they move toward the vote on the hill -- Becky.</p><p>[11:05:00] ANDERSON: Yes. Lauren, this resolution or con game as the President wants to call it. This resolution's language -- this is about the President's language, right? Even if they get the support for this resolution, what's the upshot of that?</p><p>LAUREN FOX, CNN POLITICS CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER: I think Democrats here are trying to make a statement. Right. They're trying to make a statement that they are unified behind these four members, that they are sticking together. You know, you have to remember, before the President's tweets over the weekend, Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic caucus in the House, was at a bit of a feud with the four freshman members. Now, of course, Democrats standing together against the President's tweet. And the resolution does mentions President Trump by name. It does address the fact his comments about these four members and some of the mischaracterizations of their beliefs, as well as their immigration status are to be called out. And that's what this resolution is about today. It's about Democrats showing unity. They did say they hope some Republicans would vote with them. The President, obviously, encouraging Republicans not to do that. Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, just a few minutes ago at his press conference also said he was not going to be voting for the resolution. He was encouraging Republican members not to give into Democratic politics on this feud.</p><p>But you know, a lot happening on Capitol Hill. I talked to one Republican Senator earlier, Pat Roberts, who told me he just thought everyone needed to take a deep breath, set this aside. But obviously, a lot of Democrats feeling like this is a moment that they need to speak out. They need to address the President's comments. And then some Democrats arguing this morning after caucus, then they need to move on to actually legislate -- Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Both Lauren and Joe are in Washington for you folks. Where it is mid-morning there on The Hill. While President Trump telling these American Congress women -- and let's remember these are elected U.S. lawmakers -- to go back to where they came from -- in his words, go back to where you came from.</p><p>His administration is now making it nearly impossible for some migrants to enter America, to come in. On Monday, the White House enacted a new regulation that will drastically limit asylum claims by those from Central America. Now the rule requires migrants who have lived in or traveled through a third country to first seek asylum in that country. Nick Payton Walsh, my colleague, joining us now from Mexico City. And that, Nick, means that most migrants passing through Mexico will now be blocked from seeking asylum at the U.S. border, correct?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Becky, if this law holds. I say law, it's a rule that was published today in the federal register, giving it some degree of force. Now you've been talking about the vast amount of noise, some of it really quite terrifying coming out of Washington. This is a moment of actual action though. And it's designed really, I think after a number of weeks in which the U.S. policy in the region has kind of stumbled.</p><p>They wanted Mexico. They wanted Guatemala to agree to be countries that we refer to as safe third countries and they would essentially allow migrants to apply for asylum in those countries. Mexico and Guatemala didn't seem to want to get on board on that. So unilaterally the U.S. has come forward and said, well, forget that frankly. Anybody who comes to the U.S.-Mexico border who's crossed through another country on the way -- and that's pretty much everyone unless you're Mexican -- is ineligible for an asylum application.</p><p>Now there are many rights groups that say that violates different principles of United States law. It's kind of closest some say to -- as a European, a lot of asylum claims are dealt with in Europe. Whereas the first safe country you get to where you're supposed to necessarily claim asylum.</p><p>The issue here, is that many of the migrants say Mexico -- well compare to Donald Trump -- is one of the most dangerous countries in the world, and Guatemala also a pretty dangerous place. Which the transit countries are themselves not necessarily equipped to deal with vast numbers of asylum cases or necessarily that welcoming or safe for migrants anyway.</p><p>This may not last. It is being taken to court by the ACLU. It will face legal challenges. The point I think though is here that it certainly takes away the legal possibilities for Central American migrants who make up the vast majority of those making the trek towards the U.S., Mexican border. Remember, in the last weeks, the U.S. has done everything it can to get Mexico and Guatemala to make that journey practically harder. Now really, there might be a point. Because when you get to the U.S.-Mexico border, the U.S. law as it stands -- if it's not knocked down -- may simply say you're not eligible for asylum -- Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Nick Payton Walsh is in Mexico for you. Nick, thank you.</p><p>[11:10:00] Well the United Nations refugee agency is expressing deep concern about the new U.S. asylum regulation. Saying in a statement.</p><p>This will endanger vulnerable people in need of international protection from violence or persecution.</p><p>There are many refugees around the world who would like to go home but they can't go back due to conflict or disasters. In fact, the U.N.'s refugees agency tweeted this.</p><p>More than 70 million people have been forced to flee their homes by the end of last year.</p><p>That is more people than live in many countries around the world. More, for example, than the population of the entire United Kingdom. Well one of the worst refugee crises in this region stems from the war in Syria. Millions of people have been forced out of that country and into neighboring countries like Lebanon. Russia supports and helps keep the government in Damascus in power, of course. I just sat down with Amin Awad. He is the UNHCR's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. And he has just returned from Moscow where he talked to officials about the humanitarian situation in Syria. Have a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMID AWAD, UNHCR DIRECTOR FOR MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA BUREAU: Russia is engaged with Syria. And I think that also gave us an opening to also talk to the Russians about many of the humanitarian issues. We don't talk politics. When I shuttled to Moscow -- and I did go about four times -- we talk about the humanitarian situation, about the return. About obstacles to return, clearly conditions for return, having access to people.</p><p>ANDERSON: You work with as many as 5 million people who need help inside Syria today. There are another 5.5 million outside. They will need to be repatriated. They will need to return at some point. Let's talk about the work that you do in Syria at present and in regime held areas. You work to rehabilitate these areas. You work to construct hospitals and schools. You're very much part of the reconstruction of the fabric of this country. And your agency is being criticized for effectively feathering the nest of Assad, the President, and his cronies. What you say to that?</p><p>AWAD: I think that's a misunderstanding of the type of work we do, the humanitarian imperative that we have. And also when it comes to sanctions let's say. Again, it's companies or individuals in Syria, maybe the security council sanctioned committee, there's a list of people and companies and we abide by that. We don't deal with them.</p><p>ANDERSON: How do you know you're not working with companies that are associated with the regime?</p><p>AWAD: You have to pay due diligence. You have to be aware. You have to check and recheck and you have to work with your headquarters. You have to comb all your suppliers.</p><p>ANDERSON: But you said in the past you can't comb all of those suppliers. You can't comb --</p><p>AWAD: You comb them all as much as you can.</p><p>ANDERSON: You acknowledge you must be working at times with members of the regime.</p><p>AWAD: With difficulties, we try not to really work with anybody from any regime for that matter. Syria is not the first place. This has been a standing committee on sanctions. Every country got sanctioned with whoever is in power. The UNHCR don't have to abide. It's not like we're going through back doors and through windows. It's not as black-and-white as that. It's difficult. But I think we have to move from that obsession for a moment. Our humanitarian work is the frontline stuff, the boys and girls, the men and women are frontline, have to deliver to the frail, the sick, the injured, the needy. They have to do that work.</p><p>ANDERSON: We know there are reports in Lebanon, for example, that Syrian refugees' accommodation is being bulldozed as they are being more than encouraged, forced to go back to Syria. We spoke to one minister, one Lebanese minister recently, who said, the ideal situation would be to create a no man's land in Syria run by the U.N. and put all of the refugees there. Is that realistic? Is that even on the table? Or is this just empty rhetoric by the Lebanese.</p><p>AWAD: Well from my experiences in the U.N. before, creating such zones are dangerous. They could be a false sense of security. They're not under the U.N. protection. Where is it? In the desert? In the border? Is there active fighting or not? So I think we should not be driven by that thought. I think Lebanon should be helped. There should be international burden sharing, responsibility sharing, leadership and Assad -- and the U.S. said that, European leaders and donors' leaders said that. The pledges made by donors, we asked for 8 to 9 billion for Syria and the surrounding countries.</p><p>ANDERSON: How much did you get?</p><p>[11:15:00] AWAD: Today or in July, seven months later, we only get 18 percent.</p><p>ANDERSON: Eighteen, 18 percent.</p><p>AWAD: Eighteen percent.</p><p>ANDERSON: Let's talk Libya. More than 50 refugees and migrants were killed in an air strike on the Tajoura detention center in the east of Libya's Tripoli. After appeals from your agency and others, that center as I understand it, is now closed. But local reports suggest that only a fraction of those who survived have been processed and rehoused by the UNHCR, the rest left to fend for themselves. Is that true?</p><p>AWAD: I think there's not much truth to that. I think in the same area, the same center, whoever could be saved, I think --</p><p>ANDERSON: So what happened?</p><p>AWAD: This is a problem in -- and Libya is beyond the 50 people. It's beyond that center. It's throughout the country. 450,000 of people are throughout. Some are in detention centers, some are in isolated areas, and in this heat in the desert, a huge machinery of people trafficking and smuggling. There is no governance. And that is also an issue. And I think the world have to come together really to tackle the whole issue of - - there ought to be a new international order to deal with human trafficking and smuggling.</p><p>ANDERSON: The international community has certainly woken up to the issue of Yemen, the fifth round of talks on Hodeida between the warring sides have started. That of course, is after a six-month delay on implementing the Stockholm Agreement. How likely is that these negotiations lead to a political solution to your mind? And given that we've seen reports of the Houthis now have new and advanced Yemen made weapons, how concerned are you about the Yemen population?</p><p>AWAD: I am concerned about the Yemen population. I cannot be involved in the political side of things. Yemenis are facing horrible time. I think it's the worst disaster of our time. Where Syria has biggest number of people, but the disaster really, if I characterize disaster, it is in Yemen.</p><p>ANDERSON: Are things getting better or worse though, sir, as well in Yemen.</p><p>AWAD: There's a war going, you never know. There was no access to all foreigners. The country, you cannot know. It's a huge country. With the number of children dying under the age of five silently, and buried, not even is cemented in the backyard or the front yard or the side of the road, neighborhoods, this is horrible. People are facing famine. People are facing medical problems, health problems, and generation after generation is losing education and access to anything that you could imagine is difficult, is horrible, is harsh.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: We connect you to a divided world this hour.</p><p>Coming up, a look at one of the major sources of division. Social media. Technology companies facing tough questions as U.S. lawmakers talk about whether big tech should be forced to become smaller.</p><p>And the Iran nuclear agreement on shaky ground. But the countries that signed the deal that is aside from the U.S. -- are still holding out hope.</p><p>And remember this. Exactly 50 years ago, the world standing still watching this rocket blast off. But do you remember where it was heading? That's all coming up after this.</p><p>[11:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON: This hour we are looking at people on the move. People who are often forced to flee their homes and are increasingly finding well they're not welcome elsewhere. You may recall images of these Rohingya refugees driven from their homes in Myanmar.</p><p>Facebook has acknowledged it bears some responsibility for the Myanmar violence there, by not doing enough to stop users from spreading hate on the site. Well technology, global communications, social media, they were supposed to bring us together, closer together. Weren't they? Instead, they often seem to be driving us apart. Today U.S. lawmakers are asking some tough questions at a hearing on how technology giants like Facebook, like Google, Amazon, Apple are changing our world. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now live. And many asking, is this a moment of reckoning for big tech? What do you think?</p><p>[NO AUDIO]</p><p>ANDERSON: OK, sorry about that. We looked as if we had it. I couldn't hear her. And apparently nor could you. So we will get back to Clare. But I have to say, this is what's going on at present. Just on The Hill, we've been watching discussions between lawmakers, of course, and big tech. Particularly this morning, discussions and debate about the cryptocurrency Libra, which is a digital currency that Facebook runs.</p><p>This afternoon we will be watching debate, discussion about antitrust legislation. So look, you can get this across our multi platforms on CNN, live stream, CNN.com. You can get the live stream there and with business. This is live on Capitol Hill. As tech companies face top to bottom antitrust probes. We'll see if we can get Clare back later on.</p><p>CNN \"FREEDOM PROJECT\" -- you know what, we've got her. Clare, questions being asked. I can hear you, so can everybody else. We are watching pictures from Capitol Hill and questions being asked about whether this is a day of reckoning for big tech. Is it?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Becky, I think it is very much so. We're seeing this morning a hearing on Facebook's potential cryptocurrency project called Libra. Later on this afternoon it's going to be a broad ranging hearing in the House on antitrust issues related to big tech, the likes of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee has already launched a top down investigation it says, into antitrust concerns about these companies. The real fear they say, is that they might be stifling innovation, preventing smaller companies from entering these marketplaces. So I think expect to hear questions on things like Facebook's dominance of social media. The fact it owns WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook and Google's dominance of online advertising. Amazon's dominance of e-commerce. The fact that it controls about half of e-commerce sales in the U.S. And Apple, its dominance over software sales through its app store.</p><p>There are many areas where lawmakers fear that these companies have gained too much power and we expect to see quite a lot of fireworks perhaps on this later this afternoon. As well as, of course, in this hearing this morning.</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes. And let's talk about the hearing this morning on Libra. What have been the main takeout so far?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well look, I mean there's clearly a lot of scar tissue among these lawmakers about Facebook's past when it comes to data privacy. We've heard some serious concerns from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle about how they're going to manage users' financial data. And why we should trust Facebook who hasn't had the greatest track record when it comes to data with something as difficult as money.</p><p>[11:25:00] Take a listen, Becky, to this exchange with Senator Sherrod Brown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. SHERROD BROWN, (D-OH): Do you trust your currency so much that you and your team are willing to see 100 percent of your compensation be paid to you in that currency? Which it could be if you decided it could.</p><p>DAVID MARCUS, HEAD OF CALIBRA, FACEBOOK: Senator, if your question is whether I would trust all of my assets in Libra, the answer is yes, I would. Because of feedback --</p><p>BROWN: -- but my question was, do you trust this enough to make your compensation paid fully in your currency?</p><p>MARCUS: Senator, I would. Because it is backed one for one with a reserve.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So, Becky, Facebook's argument is that Libra is to be trusted because it's backed by reserve of stable financial assets. And that this isn't just about trusting Facebook because the Libra association is this group of companies behind this project is who you should be trusting. That's 28 different companies, including Facebook. But I think there's a long way to go. There's a lot of political pressure and concern about this. We heard everything from the President tweeting about it, the chair of Federal Reserve says he has serious concerns. They don't yet know how they're going to regulate it. And we're going to continue to see more difficult questions arise on Capitol Hill as they work through this very thorny issue.</p><p>ANDERSON: Clare Sebastian on the story out of New York for you. Thank you, Clare. And you heard me, folks, a moment ago mention a CNN \"FREEDOM PROJECT\". We will get to that later this hour with a truly barbaric story. It has to be said. So stick around for that.</p><p>First though, the world working hard to prevent another war in this region. Of course, we are in the UAE here in our Middle Eastern hub. Now could there though be a new lifeline for the Iranian Nuclear Deal? That is next.</p><p>ANDERSON: Welcome back. It is 7:30 here in the UAE. You're watching CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson for you. And for those were just joining us, you are more than welcome.</p><p>A world closing in on itself, abandoning promises once made, signatures put to paperer, and shaken hands. Few places it this more clear than with the Iran Nuclear Deal. It's an agreement now on life support. But now perhaps there's a small opening for global cooperation. Just days ago Iran's President said his country would hold talks with the U.S. if sanctions are lifted.</p><p>[11:30:00] And speaking to the BBC earlier, Iran's foreign minister was defiant that Iran will not rehash the nuclear deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: We will not renegotiate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But why not?</p><p>ZARIF: You see, this deal was the subject of 12 years of negotiations. Two years of which were intense negotiations. I spent days, months negotiating this. We spent a lot of time with the United States negotiating this deal. It's about give and take.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON: I want to bring in the founder of Bourse and Bazaar which tracks developments in Iran's economy and supports business diplomacy between Europe and Iran importantly. And that's where I want to start. Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, is joining me from Washington. And let's just talk about where things stand or certainly what your sense of where things stand is at present. The Europeans clearly trying to save this deal, it seems. The U.S. not interested at this point, they say they'll talk, but those sanctions persist. The Iranians have said we'll talk if you lift these sanctions. Are we getting anywhere?</p><p>ESFANDYAR BATMANGHELIDJ, FOUNDER, BOURSE AND BAZAAR: I think you've just laid it out exceedingly well. I mean over the last few weeks since we flirted with war in the Middle East after Iran shot down that U.S. drone, I think the Europeans and Iranians have been trying to make their objectives clear.</p><p>As we just heard on the Iranian side, they have explained what their conditions are for new negotiations. That the JCPOA has to be the bench line. That Iran needs to see that here's capacity in the U.S. for halting the maximum pressure campaign and rolling back aspects of it. Because otherwise, why enter into a new set of negotiations?</p><p>And meanwhile, the European foreign ministers met on Monday in Europe to come up with a new consensus about how exactly they're going to, I think to an extent, advocate on Iran's behalf while Iran is escalating on the nuclear deal by loosening some of its commitments. Which is a gamble but it is also something that Iran needs to do if it is going to keep this at the top of the diplomatic agenda in Washington and in the European capitals.</p><p>ANDERSON: Loosening some those commitments, not quite significant enough according to the Europeans at this point, at least to have actually broken that deal. It is interesting, isn't it, that Brian Hook who is the Special Representative for the U.S. on Iran says there are no back channels operating between -- on a narrative between the U.S. and Iran at present. Which is quite unusual, one would suggest in the world of diplomacy. He is emphatic about that. Let's take that as given.</p><p>There's certainly though dialogue between the Europeans and the Iranians at present. Europe of course as we've suggested watching closely. The French President, President Macron, does seem to be leading the charge to try at least to ease tensions. He says he'll speak to the U.S., Russia and Iranian presidents. Can his mediation help at this point?</p><p>BATMANGHELIDJ: I think so. And I think it is for exactly the reason you described, which is that this is an unusual U.S. administration. And so, they are unusually disjointed in their diplomatic effort. It's really not clear what the U.S. objectives are about a year and a half into this maximum pressure campaign.</p><p>You know, Trump's instinct is to have a deal, Macron has tried to play into that instinct before. But I think the concern on the part of the French, the Europeans more broadly and certainly the Iranians, is that there are individuals in the Trump administration who are advocating a set of policies that will make diplomacy more difficult.</p><p>And if you look at some of the sanctions that have been recently applied, I think it is likely that those were intended to create barriers to diplomatic negotiations. To try to create a wall that would prevent President Trump from acting on his instincts. Macron's intercession here is largely going to be about scaling that wall, getting to Trump directly, and trying to get his attentions on this issue long enough to go around some of the more obstinate figures in the administration. Certainly that's what Iran is hoping and that's certainly what we're going to need if a new set of talks will avert furthering of the crisis.</p><p>ANDERSON: We are discussing whether there's a glimmer of hope with regard to diplomacy between the U.S. and Iran. An affront potentially, let's see, thank you, sir.</p><p>[11:35:00] BATMANGHELIDJ: Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON: I promised you CNN's \"FREEDOM PROJECT\" this hour. And this is it. Police in Britain recently dismantled the country's largest modern-day slavery network. A gang of eight people made millions of dollars by trafficking hundreds of victims from their native country of Poland. My colleague, Phil Black, spent some time with one of the men who brought that gang to justice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Peter's retro flat cap isn't a fashion choice, it's protection, a partial disguise. We can't show his face or mention his full name.</p><p>(on camera): There are people who want to hurt you.</p><p>PETER, INFORMER WORKING WITH POLICE: Yes.</p><p>BLACK (voice-over): Peter's job is freeing slaves.</p><p>PETER: I have been involved in 186 rescues.</p><p>BLACK: That made enemies and inspired threats.</p><p>PETER: They want me to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair.</p><p>BLACK: Peter is giving us a tour of Birmingham's dark underbelly in the U.K.'s second largest city on regular looking roads, inside ordinary looking houses. He helps uncover appalling hidden crimes, building trust with victims, moving them to safety. His stories are about real people, enslaved, exploited, controlled with unimaginable violence.</p><p>PETER: And a young female was tied up because she refused to do what the traffickers' asked her to do which is being involved in prostitution. She was tied up with barbed wire and some parts of her body had been put on fire.</p><p>BLACK: About one case stands out for its extraordinary scale.</p><p>(on camera): This is where some of the people were rescued.</p><p>PETER: Yes. The first victims.</p><p>BLACK (voice-over): The first people Peter ever rescued eventually led police to break up the U.K.'s biggest known modern slavery operation.</p><p>These gang members all came from Poland, so did their victims. They targeted people with few options and convinced them to travel to the U.K. for a better life. But this was the reality when they arrived. Filthy, slum like conditions. Threats, violence, forced labor for almost no pay.</p><p>The victims were put to work for unsuspecting businesses while the gang collected wages through bank accounts they controlled. Police believe they made millions of pounds. Gang members brazenly and foolishly flaunted their wealth. One bought a Bentley.</p><p>Peter and his colleagues at the anti-slavery charity, Hope for Justice, worked the case from their secret operations room. Together, they and the police identified 92 victims, but the gang is suspected of trafficking hundreds more.</p><p>PETER: I'm afraid there are still so many people believe that slavery was ended 250 ago and doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>BLACK: Peter takes us to a center that helps hundreds of homeless people in Birmingham every day. He says, this is where many former slaves end up after their captors can no longer make money from them. This center has identified 45 slavery victims in this last year alone.</p><p>(on camera): So this recent prosecution of this gang, it's not a one off.</p><p>PETER: No. There are more gangs that are still operating now. We won the battle but the war is not over yet.</p><p>BLACK (voice-over): British authorities believe slavery is a booming trade across the country, likely involving tens of thousands of victims. Peter says he will continue working to find threats, helping to free scared, vulnerable people one at a time.</p><p>PETER: More victims --</p><p>BLACK: Phil Black, CNN, Birmingham, England.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON; Shocking story. Going to take a quick break, back after this.</p><p>[11:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON: A record breaking liftoff celebrates an out of this world anniversary. The U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Alabama simultaneously launched 5,000 model rockets today. That breaks the previous Guinness world record of just over 4,000, and it is all to mark the anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. The mission began 50 years ago today.

For President Trump, it's time to at least bash several tech giants for what he said is unfair favoritism towards liberals and Democrats. When asked by CNBC's Joe Kernen on Monday morning if Facebook, Amazon and Google should be broken up, the commander-in-chief sidestepped the question in favor of ripping the companies. </p><p>'Well, I can tell you they discriminate against me,' Trump said during a phone interview. 'You know, people talk about collusion. The real collusion is between the Democrats and these companies. Because they were so against me during my election run.' Also Read: Video Publishers Sour on Facebook Watch: New Content 'Mathematically Is Not Justifiable'[1] The president added: 'Everybody said, if you don't have them, you can't win. Well, I won. And I'll win again.' The president's criticism comes after Sen. Ted Cruz complained this weekend that Twitter routinely recommended he follow Democrats rather than a mix of political voices, but it's unclear if that sparked the Monday rant. Still, it wasn't the first time the president has ripped Silicon Valley. 'Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices,' the presidenttweeted last summer[2]. 'Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration, we won't let that happen.' Also Read: The Scene at TheGrill 2019: Pamela Adlon, Tony Hale, and More at TheWrap's Media Leadership Conference (Photos)[3] Last month, the White House released a tool allowing citizens to report 'political bias' on social media.The 'Tech Bias Story Sharing Tool'[4]asks users to give some background on themselves \u2014 including their email, phone number and U.S. citizenship status \u2014 before sharing 'what happened on social media.' Users can select from a list of tech companies, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, that took action against them, and explain what happened in their own words. Major tech companies, on the other hand, have consistently denied having an overwhelming focus on conservatives. 'Impartiality is our guiding principle,' Twitter chief Jack Dorseytold [5]Congress last year. Also Read: Bette Midler Apologizes for Sharing Fake Trump Quote: 'But It Sounds SO Much Like Him'[6] Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, in his own 2018 visit to Washington, D.C.,said[7]he understands why conservatives are worried about censorship, since Silicon Valley 'is an extremely left-leaning place.' He added he was concerned about this, too, and the company was doing what it can to make 'sure that we don't have any bias in the work that we do.' The tech industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent months, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren pushing a plan to breakup major companies like Facebook and Twitter.

But he and other Republicans have long claimed that online platforms employ tactics to silence their voices, allegations that major social media companies have denied.</p><p>Dozens of pro-Trump online personalities convened in the stately East Room to discuss what they say is censorship on social media platforms, rubbing elbows with several members of Trump's cabinet and his White House team, and his son Donald Trump, Jr.</p><p>Amid the sea of suits, several red Trump campaign hats and rubber bracelets popped out. Singer Joy Villa, who describes herself as a conservative activist, wore a flamboyant stars-and-stripes formal gown.</p><p>Trump called to the stage Lila Rose, an anti-abortion activist who has been blocked from Pinterest; California lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, who has represented conservatives in free-speech lawsuits; and Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, sisters and video bloggers who are better known as Diamond and Silk.</p><p>Carpe Donktum, a pro-Trump online persona who was recently suspended by Twitter for eight days over a video depicting Trump as a cowboy attacking CNN journalist Jim Acosta, said the face-to-face event could unite online conservatives.</p><p>In freewheeling remarks that bounced from one topic to another - not unlike his Twitter feed followed by more than 61 million people - Trump talked about the power of social media, and railed against the traditional media standing at the back of the room.</p><p>\"We hardly do press releases anymore,\" Trump said. \"If I put it out on social media, it's like an explosion.\"</p><p>Trump acknowledged criticism about the online behaviour of some conservative users of social media. \"Some of you guys are out there - but even you should have a voice,\" Trump said.</p><p>\"The crap you think of is unbelievable,\" he said. \"I mean it's genius - but it's bad.\"</p><p>Trump more than once has threatened retaliatory action related to free speech. In March he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges and universities to maintain \"free speech\" on campus if they want to continue receiving federal research funds, and last September he suggested that the licence of television network NBC could be challenged over its news reporting.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, said that instead of focusing on \"combating Russian social media misinformation, punishing anti-competitive practices, or protecting Americans' data and privacy, the president has invited trolls, conspiracy theorists, anti-Semites, and the whole comments section to the White House.\"</p><p>Trump said he might invite some of the conservative social media users back to the White House for the meeting with major social media firms. Three tech officials said they had no knowledge of the meeting before Trump announced it.</p><p>Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google declined to comment on Trump's announcement that he would bring them to the White House for a meeting.</p><p>The Internet Association, a trade group representing major tech firms like Facebook, Twitter and Google, said, \"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect.\"</p><p>Republicans in Congress have held numerous hearings on the issue of alleged conservative bias on social media outlets.</p><p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who is working on proposed legislation on the issue, took the stage briefly on Thursday to air his complaints.</p><p>\"They've gotten rich off of their special privileges from government. They want to keep those, they shouldn't discriminate. They shouldn't censor,\" Hawley said.</p><p>A Senate panel chaired by Republican Ted Cruz on Tuesday will hold a hearing titled \"Google and Censorship through Search Engines\" featuring Google's vice president of public policy, Karan Bhatia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1359486</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJC-M6F1-DYXB-V4BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And this is RELIABLE SOURCES, our weekly look at the story behind story, show you how the media works, how the news gets made, and how all of us can help make it better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This hour, we have the first live interview with CNN's own Jim Acosta. He's out promoting this new brand book called \"The Enemy of the People.\" It has brand new reporting about the beginning of the Trump presidency and we're going to get into it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, Washington turning on tech companies like Google and Facebook. Why? And why now?</p><p>Well, the lawmaker leading the fight, Congressman David Cicilline, is also here live.</p><p>And later, we're going to go live to Sidney, Australia, to find out what happened here. These are images of federal police in Australia raiding one of the country's biggest newsrooms. What is going on? What are they looking for? We're going to get into that a little there.</p><p>But, first, President Trump's latest Fox News interview is causing controversy. This was Trump's 55th interview with Fox since Inauguration Day. That's more than double of any other major network combined. But this newest one was different.</p><p>He was in France there to honor soldiers who sacrificed their lives on D-Day. He sat down with Fox News host Laura Ingraham right there, right with the graves of soldiers as the backdrop. What was he thinking? What was she thinking? What were the Fox producers thinking when Trump went on a tirade.</p><p>Look, Trump did take a moment to tell Ingraham how proud he is of her ratings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: By the way, congratulations on your ratings. I'm very proud of you.</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Thanks. Thank you very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: And that wasn't even the worse part. Trump had an opportunity to attack Nancy Pelosi and Robert Mueller. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Nancy Pelosi is a disaster. Nasty, vindictive, horrible person. She's a nervous wreck. Their good friend, Bobby Mueller. We have crying Chuck Schumer who is a total political, you know, jerk.</p><p>INGRAHAM: What can you do to you night the country at a time of great polarization? What else could you do?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: That is a great question, Laura. Attacking your critics? Attacking those who you disagree with including Robert Mueller who is a veteran at a grave site? Is not uniting anybody with anything.</p><p>And, look, as I watched this interview and I watched the terrible optics, I wondered where is President Trump's communications director to oversee what the camera shots look like, who is working to protect him from those kind of gaffes. Well, let's remember, former Fox executive Bill Shine exited the White House in March and now the job remains vacant more than three months later. Maybe Trump isn't his own best communications director.</p><p>Look, I think there's a lot to discuss from this interview and so much more. Let's bring in \"New York Magazine\" senior correspondent Irin Carmon, CNN media analyst Bill Carter, and the host of \"S.E. CUPP UNFILTERED\" here on CNN, S.E. Cupp.</p><p>What do you think of this Laura Ingraham interview, S.E.? We both work here in television day by day. I don't think either of us would have allowed that kind of embarrassing situation to happen.</p><p>S.E. CUPP, CNN HOST, \"S.E. CUPP UNFILTERED\": Well, you know as well as I do a lot of prep goes into doing our show, when we're on set, but certainly and especially when you're out on location somewhere. What's the backdrop going to be? What kind of permits do we have to get?</p><p>I mea, there's a lot of steps that you have to take to designing this shot, this interview. The idea that someone said let put the president of the United States, who frequently runs off at the mouth is probably not going to hue to social norms while we're here.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>CUPP: Let's put him in front of a graveyard on one of the most sacred occasions and conduct an interview in which we ask him about politics. That was a vetted decision. That was on purpose.</p><p>I don't think they are stupid. I just don't think it was, it was polite. I don't think it was the right thing to do.</p><p>STELTER: Bill, do you think it matters?</p><p>BILL CARTER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST: Well, it doesn't matter to the audience he has.</p><p>STELTER: To the Fox audience.</p><p>CUPP: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: It doesn't matter to them. It's not going to offend them. But I think Fox is trying to elevate him by giving him that background. I think they were trying to put him in the best possible position --</p><p>STELTER: Oh, to make him look presidential.</p><p>CARTER: To make him look presidential and connect him to the sacrifice of these great soldiers, great American soldiers.</p><p>But he's totally unpredictable. They know he's going to say something outrageous and it doesn't faze them to think, well, the backdrop will be off. The Mueller comment is amazing in terms of what it says because this is a guy who did not go Vietnam for, obviously, kind of phony impairment and a guy who did go and was wounded and all of that. He criticizes in front of an American graveyard. The optics are really terrible in that context.</p><p>STELTER: We continue to see cases including this week with the president in Europe where he tells you not to believe your own ears or eyes.</p><p>[11:05:02] He did this when talking about protests. He said he hadn't seen the protests. So, maybe they were fake news.</p><p>But I thought the most interesting use of the term fake news this week was from Laura Ingraham. Did you all see this? After the interview with the president, she had to go on her show and say the president said something that wasn't true. Watch this clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: These people are so amazing and what they don't realize is that I'm holding them up because of this interview, but that's because it's you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Some of you may have heard or read that president Trump held up the D-Day ceremony to do this interview with me. That's patently false. Fake news.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STELTER: Amazing to see a Fox host correcting the president. She didn't say it was the president that made up this idea. What actually happened one of the other foreign leaders was running a little bit late so there was time for Trump to do the interview before the ceremony.</p><p>But what do you make of that, Irin?</p><p>IRIN CARMON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think we're in panopticon. We're in the M.C. Escher of B.S. right now because what happens is, it doesn't matter what reality is, it just matters what the perception is and be good for Trump. And that -- for Trump himself has always been an ever shifting justification. He doesn't have stable truths. He just -- whatever comes out of his mouth is what he thinks will benefit him the most in that exact second.</p><p>And you see Laura Ingraham taking her cues from that. It was something Trump said that was not true, which she then said other people had said which remain untrue but true to what the president has said. If your head is spinning, that's kind of point, right?. It's creating a sense much disorientation.</p><p>At the end of the day, you think there are people who are against Trump and there are people who are not, and regardless what the facts are, this is, I know this word gets abused so much in this day and age. But this is classic gaslighting. The gaslighting story is oh, no that lamp didn't move. It must be your imagination. Oh, the president didn't say that or the president didn't make you late.</p><p>Whatever it is, in the end, everyone else is lying and I'm the only person telling you the truth.</p><p>STELTER: Right, to just stick with your tribe and don't believe what you can see, you're right.</p><p>CARMON: Don't trust your eyes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STELTER: Let's take a turn to 2020 for a moment because there's been a lot of headlines about Joe Biden. In many cases, in many ways, this race the revolving around Biden right now.</p><p>Take a look at this headlines from \"The Journal\", from Fox, from elsewhere, about Biden, quote, flipping over abortion funding. This is about the Hyde Amendment and Biden's change in position.</p><p>Irin, what's the media back story?</p><p>CARMON: Well, I think it's really interesting because even since Biden was vice president, there has been ground level activism and online activism that has increasingly gotten the ears of mainstream media criticizing the Hyde Amendment. Now, the Hyde Amendment has been in placed for decades. It's been the status quo. Barack Obama called it tradition, right?</p><p>This is something that's not been in the center of Democratic politics but because of Twitter, Facebook, online organizing and grassroots organizing I think mainstream media now is more aware that there's an internal debate among progressives about whether things Hyde Amendment throw low-income women under the bus. That pipeline got shorter and shorter between progressive ideas and mainstream journalists like NBC News asking Biden --</p><p>STELTER: It's helping shift the party, right? It's helping shift --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARMON: It's shifting the party to the left, changing what the center is.</p><p>CUPP: I also think another story here is that Joe Biden has not been running a traditional campaign where he does a lot of media, where he does a lot of retail politics. So, we don't have a lot of interviews with him yet. So these moments, these gaffes, these campaign breakdowns are all we have.</p><p>STELTER: Right. He's not holding a pressers. He's not doing interviews.</p><p>CUPP: That's right.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>CUPP: So, they are sticking out. I think he would be better served doing a lot more interviews, sitting down. I know there's a risk involve in that. But I think it would help sort of de-saturate the environment so this is not all we're left talking about.</p><p>STELTER: That's interesting.</p><p>CUPP: Give us some more face time, Joe. We want to hear from you.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>CARTER: He did not go into this entirely prepared. You would think this wouldn't come up in an era when so much of the Democratic focus is on women's issues and women are so vital to their base. That they wouldn't have thought that through and talk about a communications director.</p><p>Why didn't someone clue him in that these things would come up?</p><p>STELTER: Let's end --</p><p>CARMON: It's too late.</p><p>CARTER: Yes.</p><p>CARMON: They were not prepared.</p><p>STELTER: Remember, people ask me about the Democratic race. I remind them this time four years ago, Trump hadn't entered the GOP race yet. It's so early.</p><p>But I bring that up because we're at an anniversary. This time next week is the four-year anniversary of Trump riding down the escalator. It's remarkable to go back and watch the television coverage from that day and how seriously he was taken or maybe not.</p><p>S.E., you were on CNN's coverage that morning.</p><p>CUPP: Yes. STELTER: You even had an embargoed copy of his speech.</p><p>CUPP: There I am.</p><p>STELTER: What was the day like for you four years later?</p><p>CUPP: It was bizarre. I mean, we can go to Foucault and the panopticon, but I go to Seinfeld. It was a bizarre world. It was a bizarre world.</p><p>I had gotten an embargoed copy of the speech from the campaign.</p><p>[11:10:03] And not a lot of people had because they didn't have a lot of contacts in the media yet.</p><p>STELTER: Right, right,</p><p>CUPP: So, I'm looking at this. And I think this is actually very serious and substantive.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>CUPP: And within the first sentence that script was abandoned and I'm watching along with everyone else mouth agape, you know, eyes wide- open, none of the script, the script was tossed in what would become his hallmark going off script.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>CUPP: And I just remember thinking this is bizarre. Not taking it seriously. To my discredit, not taking it very seriously because he didn't appear to be taking it as seriously as I expected him to, via that speech.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, he was in reality host mode. You were all able to turn away and I think when you look back at that first day that told you where we were going. It was entertaining, it was shocking. This was some racism involved involving Mexicans.</p><p>Bill, last thought?</p><p>CARTER: Well, it was interesting. Howard Stern came out and said he thought it was a PR stunt. That Trump was doing it as PR stunt.</p><p>Remember, he announced he was running before. People thought he would never do it, never make his taxes public. Of course he didn't. He wound up running anyway. .</p><p>STELTER: Well, four years ago. Look at where we are.</p><p>Panel, please stick around. A quick break here coming up from the front lines of the Trump White House. Jim Acosta joins us for his first live interview about his new book. That's coming up next.</p><p>STELTER: It is one of the president's most poisonous phrases, \"the enemy of the people\". He's used the phrase more than 30 times on Twitter, usually attacking news outlets like CNN.</p><p>[11:15:05] Most recently, just a few hours ago, it's tiresome, yes, but it's still damaging, casting fellow Americans as enemies.</p><p>Well, it is also a phrase CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta is now reclaiming. He's out this Tuesday with a new book entitled \"The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America.\"</p><p>Now, the book is out on Tuesday. And Jim Acosta is here for his first live interview all about it.</p><p>Jim Acosta, chief White House correspondent for CNN, why write a book about your experience?</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, I wanted to send a message, you know, to folks who really care about what we do and the message is basically this. I did not want my children to group in a country where the press is called the enemy of the people.</p><p>Brian, you and I have grown-up in a country in the last several decades here where, you know, Republicans, Democrats wanted to be in power in Washington, but they didn't demonize us to this extent. And I think it's gotten -- I think it started off as an act based on my reporting that the president threw out fake news, the enemy of the people just to sort of taunt and troll us. And that has essentially gotten out of control.</p><p>And now, it's gotten to the point where his supporters, some of his supporters, many of them are wonderful people, but some of those supporters feel it's OK to lash out at us in ways that I think put us in danger, and I think we have to pause, hit the pause button and think deeply about whether or not this is the kind of country we want to hand off to our kids.</p><p>STELTER: Some of your critics say, if this really was a dangerous time to tell the truth in America, you wouldn't be able to write a book about it.</p><p>ACOSTA: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: What do you say to them?</p><p>ACOSTA: Well, I don't want it to become more dangerous time. And as you and I both know, Brian, we had a pipe bomb delivered to CNN's headquarters last fall. And as I lay out in this book, you know, I've received a number of death threats. I'm not the only one. A number of news anchors and reporters who cover this president on a daily basis receive death threats.</p><p>And, you know, we don't know how serious they are. It could just be people venting their frustrations, and I get that. You know, we all get mad about what we see on the news on a daily basis. But --</p><p>STELTER: But some are serious. There have been arrests in some cases, yes.</p><p>ACOSTA: Right. That's right, and the question is, whether or not somebody crosses that line and does something that hurts somebody or perhaps kills a journalist and as I write in the book, Brian, I think at that point, we cross over into a different era for the United States. Where we join a list of other countries around the world where the press is not safe to do their jobs and we just can't do that. We cannot take that step because I think it's a far slipperier slope than we possibly can imagine at this point.</p><p>STELTER: You can't let it happen here.</p><p>ACOSTA: That's right.</p><p>STELTER: Some people don't know, you sign this deal, to write this book before the midterms. Then, of course, the day after the midterms, the president kicked you out of the White House. The White House revoked your press pass.</p><p>Looking back, do you think the president was just trying to distract from losing the House, the Democratic gains in the midterms?</p><p>ACOSTA: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: Was he trying to come up with -- change the narrative and that's why he kicked you out?</p><p>ACOSTA: Right. I saw that -- I've seen that theory, you know, tossed around. My sense of it is if you go back and I talk about it in the book if you look what happens during the news conference, it's not just the confrontation he has with me. He refers to Yamiche Alcindor's question, she's a reporter from PBS, refers to her question as being a racist question at one point during the press conference because he asked or she asked him about this label that he gives himself that he's a nationalist and is that a dog whistle to white nationalists out there.</p><p>And so, there were other moments where the president comes off as rattled and off of his game and some might same unhinged. And so, I don't think it was one of those moments where he was throwing red meat into the water and bright shiny object to change the narrative. I think he's clearly frustrated.</p><p>STELTER: You do conclude the book with the lawsuit and CNN's victory in court.</p><p>ACOSTA: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: Let's go back to the beginning, first full day of Trump presidency. Sean Spicer is sent out by the president to go and lie about the crowd size. Do you ever think about what would have happened if crowd size hadn't been the story of day one of Trump presidency?</p><p>ACOSTA: Well, I think it probably would have been a much smoother beginning to his presidency, obviously. But this was a clear casing point where the president is distracted and sometimes consumed by things that are just trivial. Why on earth when you're about to become commander-in-chief and president of the United States are you concerned about what kind of crowd size you have, and why would you insist your press secretary go out and lie to the American people?</p><p>And by the way, when Kellyanne Conway goes out there and says, well, you know, Sean Spicer was giving alternative facts, you know, she also got herself into a situation where, you know, they are all piling on, trying to explain way the president's behavior and rhetoric.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>ACOSTA: And as I write in the book, you know, Kellyanne Conway kind of regrets making that comment. She said to me that was a slip of the tongue she didn't mean to say alternative facts, she meant to say something different.</p><p>And what I found going back talking to various officials is that from time to time there was a sense of regret about what they've all been through. Yes, they are passionate supporters of the president, but in Kellyanne Conway's case, I think she now wishes that she could have had that one over again.</p><p>[11:20:07] She wishes she had not said that because she insists in this book that this was not intended to be an Orwellian phrase on her part.</p><p>STELTER: Right, the way it was interpreted.</p><p>ACOSTA: Right.</p><p>STELTER: You do quote sources on the record and also on background anonymously, you quote an unnamed senior White House official saying, quote, the president is insane. Was that person speaking literally or figuratively?</p><p>ACOSTA: I think he was venting his frustrations, this particular official. We sat down one to talk about how things were going with this particular source's area of expertise. I don't want to get too deeply into that.</p><p>But plopped down in the seat in front of me and said the president is insane. And I later went back later and talked to this official and I said, why did you say that?</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>ACOSTA: And this official said, you know, really, I was just frustrated with the president's lack of understanding about the Constitution, the constraints placed on the presidency. You know guardrails were put in place by our Founding Fathers.</p><p>The president wanted to know how long you can keep an acting secretary on. He wanted to know, you know, what else he could do with his cabinet. It's this kind of behavior behind-the-scenes that really frustrates his top officials I think a lot more than people understand.</p><p>STELTER: I see.</p><p>ACOSTA: So, I think this official was trying to explain all of that.</p><p>STELTER: One, you mentioned Kellyanne Conway, her husband George Conway continues to say the president is mentally unwell, unfit. Take a look at his latest tweets from today saying the president should resign and seek psychological treatment. I commented that the tweets are astonishing coming from the husband of a top White House official.</p><p>And Conway wrote back and said, what's astonishing is the media's and a nation's utter failure to confront the fact that we have a psychologically unwell and unfit president.</p><p>How do you view this as someone who covers the Trump White House every day, that these questions are even out there at all?</p><p>ACOSTA: Well, I get asked this question from time to time. I tell folks, Brian, I'm not a psychiatrist, so I can assess the president's mental state. But I will tell you my sense of it is covering him for a pretty long period of time now is that he's more crazy like a fox.</p><p>And, you know, for example, you know, Steve Bannon explains in an interview I had with him that, you know, what Trump tries to do is really control the narrative by saying sensational things that sound wild and nutty sometimes and he does this because he knows it dominates the news cycle. And so, that makes it a priority for us in the news business to talk about him nonstop and he loves that and he capitalizes on that.</p><p>STELTER: Well, about that, do you have any regrets? Do you have any regrets, you said some White House aides, do you have any regrets?</p><p>ACOSTA: Do I have any regrets? You know, I wish at times that the press had been a bit more in solidarity with one another and standing up to this White House and saying, listen, you know, president can't call us the enemy of the people. We're not going to go along with that.</p><p>And I think we've missed some opportunities here and there to challenge that. I will say, one of the things that I'm most grateful for during this experience is how just about every news organization in Washington and here in New York stood behind us here at CNN when they took away my press pass.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, there was a lawsuit.</p><p>ACOSTA: That was a very important First Amendment case, and I talked about it in the book.</p><p>Had the Trump administration won that case, Brian, it would have sent shockwaves through our industry. It would have put a real chilling effect on the First Amendment in this country and people might say oh, you're just puffing yourself up. You're high on your own fumes. No, the Trump administration's own lawyers went into the courtroom and said the president of the United States can throw out whoever he wants out of the White House. And we couldn't just have a situation like that.</p><p>And so, I was really grateful -- you talk about regrets, one of the things I'm most grateful for is that almost our entire industry stood behind us during that time. And had they not, I think, it could have worked out a different way. So I think, you know, it hasn't been perfect. We're all grappling with, how do we cover this president?</p><p>But my sense is that we have to stand for truth. We're not just here to report the news. We're here also to defend the truth. And when you have a president who has made, you know, 10,000 false or misleading statements since the beginning of his administration, you know that makes us fact checkers in real-time.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>ACOSTA: It puts us in a position unlike Republicans who controlled the government for two years, sort of makes the forth estate, the press, really the check on a presidency that sometimes goes outside the bounds of normal presidential behavior.</p><p>STELTER: Are you tired?</p><p>ACOSTA: Am I tired? You know, maybe after this is all and said and done with the book tour I'll take a break.</p><p>STELTER: OK, OK.</p><p>ACOSTA: But I love this job, Brian, as you do. And I feel this is such an important time and the challenge that we're up against. You know, I talk about how the truth is worth the fight. I deeply and passionately believe that.</p><p>Brian, I know you're a father, I'm a dad, I don't want our kids to group in a country where it's OK to say the press is the enemy. And I know that sounds corny and it sounds like, oh, Jim is just getting on a soapbox.</p><p>It's not taking a stand on a political issue.</p><p>STELTER: No, it's not.</p><p>ACOSTA: It's taking a stand on an American issue.</p><p>STELTER: It's not.</p><p>ACOSTA: We should not be called the enemy of the people. You're not my enemy. Trump supporters are not our enemy.</p><p>And so, I hope if there's an overarching message that folks take away from this book is that they have a deep appreciation for what we do and understand that, you know, listen, we're out here doing our jobs.</p><p>[11:25:15] STELTER: Trying our best.</p><p>ACOSTA: And we're not the enemy.</p><p>STELTER: Jim, thanks for being here.</p><p>ACOSTA: Thank you, Brian. I appreciate it.</p><p>STELTER: The book is \"Enemy of the People.\" It's out on Tuesday. And before we go, let's put the graphic up, 90 days, that's how long it's been since a formal on camera White House briefing, 90 days. That's a record.</p><p>ACOSTA: Let's bring them back.</p><p>STELTER: Let's bring them back.</p><p>Up next here, the congressman spearheading what he says is a top to bottom look at whether and how to address big tech's dominance over the digital marketplace. Congressman David Cicilline is next.</p><p>STELTER: Seventy-nine days, yes, more than 11 weeks have passed since Robert Mueller turned in its report with all those troubling details about possible obstruction of justice.</p><p>And take a look at this graphic. These are the Democrats in the House of Representatives that are calling for impeachment or an impeachment inquiry. Of course, there are lots and lots of faces, 200 faces, not on this graphic.</p><p>But one of the faces on here is David Cicilline. He's joining me now. He's chair of a subcommittee involving antitrust that's holding an important hearing about big tech on Tuesday.</p><p>And, Congressman, I want to get to that in a moment. But, first, I do wonder where things stand with regards to Robert Mueller? He still has not spoken to any House or Senate committee. What's the hold up?</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): I know there have been ongoing discussions with Mr. Mueller's team and the Judiciary Committee. I think all of the members of the committee understand that it is absolutely critical that Mr. Mueller come before the committee. I think he has a duty to walk the American people through the findings in his report, explain his decisions and the decisions he's made and the evidence he's collected.</p><p>[11:30:00] And I expect that Mr. Mueller will be before the Judiciary Committee to testify before the American people.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN ANCHOR: It seems like it's taking a very long time. Do you feel the Democrats have lost the messaging war on this issue?</p><p>CICILLINE: No, I don't think it's -- look, we want to make sure we're doing this right. We want to be respectful of the special counsel. I think it's always better a witness comes voluntarily. I think someone who's devoted 22 months to this intense investigation is -- deserves that sort of treatment and I think trying to accommodate him makes sense. But if that doesn't work, then obviously we'll compel his attendance. But there's no question the American people need to hear from the special counsel.</p><p>STELTER: Meantime, lots of other business before Congress, and you're starting a series of hearings on Tuesday involving big tech. You're not the only part of the government looking into Google, Facebook, etcetera. We learned this week that the FTC and the DOJ have divvied up responsibility for probes into these giant technology players. It seems like Google and Facebook are facing the most heat right now. What do you want to learn with your congressional hearings involving antitrust?</p><p>CICILLINE: Well, this is part of a really a broad investigation. This is a bipartisan investigation launched by the Judiciary Committee that will be led by the antitrust subcommittee, and it's really to look at the entire marketplace, these large technology platforms are very dominant, is to look at the sort of monopoly moment that we're in and figure out how we get the market working right.</p><p>We want to be sure that they're on engaging in anti-competitive behavior, that isn't harming consumers, harming our access to truthful reliable information, that they're not excluding rivals. You know competition matters in our economy. It's how you generate innovation and entrepreneurship and protect consumers.</p><p>And we've seen some consequences of this tremendous concentration of economic power in these large technology platforms, a complete disregard for the privacy of users, misuse of data so that consumers don't really control what happens to their data.</p><p>So this is going to be a top-to-bottom review to see how the markets working, what do we need to do to make sure their competition exists in this space and we're protecting workers and consumers and people who are using the Internet. We're in a really serious monopoly moment.</p><p>STELTER: You've called for the breakup of -- you've called for the breakup of Facebook. So why should these companies believe that this will be a fair hearing?</p><p>CICILLINE: No, I haven't called for the -- Brian, no, I haven't called for the breakup of Facebook, no. I've called for an FTC investigation and we're going to look at a number of technology companies --</p><p>STELTER: Into Facebook. OK.</p><p>CICILLINE: -- including Facebook. But you know a broad cross -- this is not focused on a particular company. It's really a focus on the digital marketplace that where these large technology platforms are incredibly dominant to figure out why the marketplace is not working. I wonder if you have any view about President Trump weighing in not on the tech companies but on the big media companies. We saw this week the president tweet suggesting a boycott of CNN's parent company AT&amp;T because he doesn't like how CNN covers him. He was pretty explicit about that but in his tweets. He also called out the outcast by name yesterday when criticizing NBC.</p><p>Is it appropriate for a president to suggest a boycott of an American company because he doesn't like the news coverage?</p><p>CICILLINE: No, of course not. You know, I was listening to your interview of Jim Acosta, and not only is the media not enemies of the people, they are the guardians of our democracy. And in fact, that's the first hearing that we're going to conduct with respect to this investigation is the impact of these large duopolies on access to trustworthy local news, reliable information.</p><p>They are as you know, these two large platforms are really taking much of the revenue using the content of local newspapers and online publishers and putting them out of business. You see examples of it all across the country. That's a problem because these small newspapers don't have leverage. They can't negotiate with the two big large technology platforms. They're really at their will in terms of how their content is used.</p><p>As a consequence, we're seeing a real decline in local news. This is not just the sale of widgets. This is about voters ability, the American people's ability to access trustworthy, reliable local news to hold officials to account, to expose corruption.</p><p>This is a centerpiece of our democracy. So this is about whether or not you know, citizens of this country will continue to receive local news which is so essential to the functioning of our government. And so that's the first thing we're going to explore in the first hearing that we have as a part of this investigation.</p><p>STELTER: Congressman, thank you so much for being here. Great talking with you.</p><p>CICILLINE: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.</p><p>STELTER: And he teed up our next segment perfectly. You're going to hear from three of the experts who will be testifying at his hearing on Tuesday. Find out what they want Congress to do. That's next.</p><p>[11:35:00] STELTER: Newspapers big and small feel like they're under assault with platforms like Google and Facebook taking away precious ad revenue. The platforms say they are not the enemy but this issue is going to be in the spotlight on Tuesday when Congressman David Cicilline antitrust hearing takes place.</p><p>We were just talking with him about his examination of Google and Facebook etcetera. His first hearing is about local journalism, about what he calls a free and diverse press. They're going to be talking about a law, a bill that's been introduced called the journalism competition and preservation act. Cicilline introduced it earlier this year alongside a Republican counterpart Doug Collins. It's a rare display of bipartisan support.</p><p>The bill would allow publishers to temporarily bypass the existing antitrust laws that otherwise protect big tech from having to negotiate with these publications. Let me explain more about this. I spoke with three witnesses who are set to testify at Tuesday's hearing. All of them told me they plan to plug this pending piece of legislation.</p><p>News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern, Sally Hubbard is a Director of Enforcement Strategy for the Open Markets Institute, and the editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Kevin Riley. Now, hear from all of them but first Chavern, I asked him what this bill is all about.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID CHAVERN, CEO, NEWS MEDIA ALLIANCE: You know, the government can't regulate the news business under the First Amendment but now we have two major companies that effectively do regulate us. They stand between us in our readers and determine everything about that relationship. And what we're asking is for the ability for news publishers to be able to act collectively to bargain for a better more sustainable arrangement because the platforms now get advantage of all of our content and returned very little of the money back to sustain the future journalism.</p><p>STELTER: So you want what, a four-year opportunity for newspapers to work together?</p><p>CHAVERN: Yes, interesting the way they -- the antitrust laws currently protect Google and Facebook from us, if you can believe that or not. And what we want is the antitrust exemption if you will, safe harbor that would allow us to collectively act to negotiate for a better deal. It's limited in time to four years and it's about money yes, but it's also about algorithms and data, and how our brand is presented to folks.</p><p>We're not asking the government to regulate anybody or tax anybody. We're asking them mostly just to leave us alone.</p><p>[11:40:00] STELTER: This bill is called the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act. People can Google it, can look it up, can read more about it. Sally, is this bill a good idea.</p><p>SALLY HUBBARD, DIRECTOR OF ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY, OPEN MARKETS INSTITUTE: You know, ordinarily I don't support exemptions from the antitrust laws but in this case, I do support this bill. At this point, the bargaining power that the tech companies have is so huge and the publishers really don't have any bargaining power to get fair terms and conditions. So I think it's appropriate for this situation and especially because it's limited in scope. I do support it.</p><p>I also wanted to point out that the hearing is not only about this bill. The exemption is very important but that we also need to have other remedies to kind of break up the stranglehold that the tech platforms have over the ad revenue that is so essential to support journalism. KEVIN RILEY, EDITOR, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: This is -- I think there's a realization in Congress. And I've had a chance to talk to Representative Collins. I think the realization is that gosh, this system doesn't seem to be working, you know. The American Way is the person who really invests in something as a local newspaper invested enormous amounts of money and time in covering local news and local issues on a benefit from that investment.</p><p>STELTER: Kevin, I noticed in a recent speech you talked about how the Atlanta Journal-Constitution has changed, how it used to be that 80 percent of the revenue would come from advertising and 20 percent from subscriptions, and you said now that has to flip. Now you've got to be primarily supportive based on subscriptions. We're seeing that same transition from papers across the country. How is that transition going for the AJC?</p><p>RILEY: Well, let me try to -- let me try to explain it this way, Brian, because at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, our audience has never been larger than it is today. And I think that is true of many, many newspapers when you combine the print audience and the massive digital audience that we can all garner in our markets.</p><p>So does it make sense that at a time when our audience as its biggest point our financial difficulties are at their most difficult point? To me, that doesn't make sense. I mean it sounds illogical and that's what I think is starting to get attention from people in Congress and elsewhere.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STELTER: We're going to have full coverage of Tuesday's hearing at CNNBusiness.com. Before we go, let me quickly tell you about my brand-new podcast. It's a special five-episode series called Apollo 11 Beyond the Moon. We are looking back at the moon mission 50 years later and looking ahead to Mars.</p><p>You can listen to my interview with Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins, plus some other special guests. Look up the podcast at Apple, on Spotify, or whatever your favorite podcasting app is. And we'll be right back with more RELIABLE SOURCES in just a moment.</p><p>[16:45:00] STELTER: Australia is democratic but this is not what democracy looks like. An outrage still swelling over the police raid at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation earlier this week. Investigators entered the newsroom, went through files, they were looking for evidence -- for information involving leaks of secret information about possible unlawful killings by Australian troops in Afghanistan.</p><p>So in other words, it's a leak hunt. We've seen these in countries around the world. In fact, a new report finds that press freedom is deteriorating in many countries including Australia. Let's talk about that. Our panel is back here with me. And Irin Carmon, first to you, how serious is this to see federal police raiding a newsroom looking for a leaker?</p><p>IRIN CARMON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: This is deeply disturbing, Brian. I mean, these are stories that are unquestionably in the public interest. They concern matters of surveillance, of national security. There is always a line that journalists have to exercise about making sure that their reporting is tailored, making sure that they're not putting people in danger, but these stories met that standard. And so I think it's deeply worrying.</p><p>And I actually -- when I travel to Australia last year to talk about reporting on #MeToo, investigative reporting on #MeToo, I heard from Australian journalists how constrained they are because the country doesn't have the First Amendment protections that we have. They don't have a tradition or a written statute that protects journalists. Instead, it really comes down to the discretion of law enforcement.</p><p>That's a dangerous place to be as we're seeing even in the United States where we do have those kinds of constitutional protections, there's still a certain amount of discretion that prosecutors can exercise. And so when you see journalistic activities for example in the U.S. being prosecuted under the Espionage Act, I think it's really important that we look to Australia.</p><p>And think yes, OK, we've got our First Amendment, but there is also always a danger of criminalizing journalism that makes people in power uncomfortable.</p><p>STELTER: Right, it has a chilling effect. Let's put on screen that map, this new report that shows deteriorating conditions in many different countries. We saw this recently in San Francisco where a freelance journalist home was raided, it's because police there are looking for a leaker. The point here is that a lot of this is about norms not laws, S.E., and these norms are being eroded.</p><p>SE CUPP, CNN HOST: I think it's also important to point out that the AFP also raided the home of journalist Annika Smethurst as part of this leak hunt inside of Australian media.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>CUPP: That should be also deeply, deeply disturbing. You know, we like to think of a sort of wall between our professional lives and our personal lives. And when that wall is crossed by in this case the AFP, I think that has a certain chilling effect on the way journalists do their job that maybe police are going to come into my home and raid my home, not just my place of business which is bad enough, but your personal space.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, whether it's Sydney or San Francisco or anywhere else, these reports are in the public interest.</p><p>CUPP: Of course.</p><p>STELTER: Australians deserve to know what happened in Afghanistan on their name. BILL CARTER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST: I think the interesting thing is we have the First Amendment, a lot of these countries don't. We have right courts that are supposed to back it up. We're not entirely sure that's going to happen anymore. That's a little bit under -- on doubt. I think the people of the country have to step up and say we this is intolerable.</p><p>[11:50:08] STELTER: And thankfully they have been.</p><p>CARTER: They are.</p><p>STELTER: I think that's good. And there has been a lot outburst on this.</p><p>CARTER: There has been. Yes.</p><p>STELTER: A quick break here, much more of the panel in a moment including conversation about YouTube's latest ban sparking debate.</p><p>STELTER: Where is the line and who is deciding? Every week there's news about a tech company banning accounts. This week it's been YouTube's announcing they're going to ban white supremacist content, Nazi content, and also videos denying proven atrocities like the Holocaust and the Sandy Hook shooting.</p><p>It might sound like a great thing but there's also been a backlash and there's also been some problems with the way it's being enforced. Some educational videos about these issues have also been removed and banned. Let's bring back our panel to discuss this. S.E. Cupp, it seems like it's been a year now with conversations about banning accounts.</p><p>CUPP: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: We've seen a lot of changes in that year and I think people find the slope to be very slippery.</p><p>CUPP: It's a tough -- it's a tough line to navigate. In this case, I think erring on the side of not censoring is generally the best position especially when censoring includes educational information, facts, history. I find it particularly jarring though that the people begging corporations to censor this are mostly journalists. That is really alarming to me.</p><p>[11:55:16] STELTER: Are journalists begging or are they calling out extremist content on the platforms?</p><p>CUPP: They are doing both. They are saying, YouTube you must do something about this and that something is generally get rid of this content. I hope they don't have to say I hate this content.</p><p>STELTER: But some are --</p><p>CARMON: But journalist -- but journalist exercise editorial judgment every day.</p><p>CARTER: All the time.</p><p>CUPP: Sure.</p><p>CARMON: That's not censorship. That's deciding what's good quality content and what's incitement. I mean, the larger question here I think is that it's beyond white supremacist content, right. It's misogynistic content, it is anti-vax, it is child --</p><p>CUPP: None of it is illegal.</p><p>CARMON: It is pedophilia.</p><p>STELTER: But whatever happens -- that's illegal, but whatever happen to meet terrible speech with more speech?</p><p>CUPP: That's right.</p><p>CARMON: But the recommendation engine of YouTube takes us into a new territory, right. There's been excellent reporting and studies in the last week, a lot of it published in the New York Times showing that beyond even this more speech, the recommendation engine of YouTube is driving people towards ever more extreme content. That's an editorial curation that they are doing and says --</p><p>STELTER: On that, I agree with you. The algorithm is able to radicalize people.</p><p>CARTER: And they're doing it for (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CARMON: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>CARTER: And they -- and they want to make money off that. They've been making money off that. That's part of their -- so they need to they have to have an editorial, every journalism organization, every --</p><p>CUPP: It's not a journalism organization.</p><p>CARTER: Well, OK, but --</p><p>STELTER: We're out of time. We will keep it going this time next week on more RELIABLE SOURCES. Thanks for joining us. We're back here this time next week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019060901CNV50</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9R-NCP1-DXH2-64GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7388\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 9, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Team Trump Twitter account claims Facebook wants to make changes that will make it harder for politicians to target its users with ads. However, while Facebook has said it is evaluating its advertising tools, it hasn't made any indication as to what changes it may ultimately make, if any. Attacking big tech is perceived as a winning campaign strategy by politicians on both the left and the right. </p><p>Read more on the Business Insider homepage[1]. President Trump's 2020 election campaign is lashing out at Facebook over fears that the social network may change its ad targeting options. On Wednesday, the official Twitter account for Team Trump slammed the Silicon Valley social networking firm[2], warning that theoretical changes will \"raise prices to put more of your hard earned small dollar donations into their pockets.\" The attack comes amid bitter and ongoing debate over Facebook's policies on political ads. The company has been criticised for allowing politicians to lie in ads \u2014 a position it has defended on free speech grounds. And some critics, including a group of current Facebook employees, have called on the company to make changes to how political ads can be targeted in an attempt to rein in their impact. Earlier this week, top Facebook advertising exec Carolyn Everson said that it wouldn't make changes to political ad targeting mechanisms[3], saying \"that's not on the table.\" But she subsequently rowed that back, with Axios reporter Sara Fisher tweeting that[4] \"she says the company is still considering a number of options and nothing is off the table.\" Thus far, Facebook has given no indication of what \u2014 if anything \u2014 it might change about its political advertising tools, or given a timetable for any such changes. But Trump's campaign has presented the company's comments as statements of intent to make changes that would damage its ability to campaign. In a tweet that begins \"IMPORTANT\" on Wednesday, the Team Trump account wrote that \"@Facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020. Tools that help us reach more great Americans ...ft voices the media and big tech choose to ignore!\"Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1197217636662337536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw IMPORTANT@facebook[5] wants to take important tools away from us for 2020.;Tools that help us reach more great Americans ...ft voices the media ...g tech choose to ignore!They want to raise prices to put more of your hard earned small dollar donations into their pockets. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/gJbFfTLnzW\">https://t.co/gJbFfTLnzW</url>[6] A Facebook spokesperson did not immediately provide comment on Facebook's current intentions around political advertising. The Trump campaign's purported warning is the latest attack from a 2020 presidential hopeful, who have found big tech an easy candidate for criticism and for firing up their base. Trump and other American right-wing figures have repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that tech companies are trying to censor conservative voices online. And on the left, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is part of a growing chorus calling[7] for antitrust action to be taken against Facebook and other tech firms.

And there is little question that some tech firms enjoy market power in certain markets, he conceded. But Delrahim quickly added that the allegations against the companies thus far are merely \"anecdotal stories.\"</p><p>\"I don't know if any of the enforcement bodies necessarily have that credible evidence,\" Delrahim said.</p><p>Delrahim's remarks underscore the shifting regulatory risks for tech companies in Washington. From Congress to the White House, the rhetoric is growing for policymakers to rein in the industry - but few can agree on how, or which government powers should be brought to bear.</p><p>Delrahim on Friday also dipped his toe into a swirling debate over whether tech companies' products may be discriminating against conservative viewpoints.</p><p>\"I'm concerned about the concerns that have been raised,\" Delrahim said, \"because not so much is it 'because conservatives,' but because one day, depending on ownership, it could be liberals. I think you have to be very careful about the power of big companies in a democracy.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, the Justice Department cited those allegations to justify holding a meeting with state attorneys general to discuss the tech platforms.</p><p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions sought to raise the issue of bias several times during the meeting. But state law enforcement officials steered the conversation instead toward the companies' privacy practices and their use of consumer data - indicating that Silicon Valley could soon face greater scrutiny from multiple states over the business model that has created billionaires out of tech executives such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>Still, antitrust regulators seeking to penalize the industry would be required to persuade court officials using economic data. And antitrust experts say the problem is that harms to innovation can be difficult to prove. Regulators may never be certain, for example, whether Instagram would have grown to become equally successful had it not been purchased by Facebook.</p><p>\"We cannot quantify edge innovation, let alone connect it empirically to a platform's discriminatory conduct,\" said Hal Singer, an economist at George Washington University's Institute for Public Policy. Delrahim, he said, is seeking \"an evidentiary standard that cannot be satisfied here.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-0c9e217685df4247833dbe1970440347</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC7-RV21-DXKP-J3P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"480\"/><timeReceived>2:37 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 28, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

These actions make the allegedly tough announcement[1] on Tuesday of an antitrust inquiry into the dominant tech platforms ring hollow; results matter, not sharp words. And on the results, the Trump antitrust apparatus has continued a 40-year legacy of failure. First, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a $5 billion settlement[2] with Facebook, for violations of a 2011 consent decree on privacy standards. </p><p>Or at least that's the theory: Facebook did not have to admit guilt[3] in the matter, and none of their executives, up to and including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have to face any personal sanction. Zuckerberg was not even brought in[4] to the FTC for an interview. The $5 billion price tag represents about a month of revenue[5] for Facebook, and it releases the company from liability far beyond[6] the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where up to 87 million users[7] had their data stolen by the third-party analyst. The order covers Facebook using phone numbers[8] given for security reasons in advertising, applying facial recognition technology[9] without an opt-out setting, ignoring third-party app privacy[10] violations, harvesting of email passwords[11] for other services, storing passwords without encryption[12], and several other actions. It's almost a blanket immunity grant for Facebook's privacy practices. And it resolves all potential violations of the consent order up to June 12, 2019, an unknown number of them unspecified. While Facebook has to certify compliance with safeguarding of consumer privacy, the settlement makes no structural changes to the company's business model of targeted advertising, without which there would be no violations. Neither Democrat on the FTC voted for this abomination, and commissioner Rohit Chopra's dissent[13] explains why adequately. 'The order allows Facebook to decide for itself how much information it can harvest from users and what it can do with that information, as long as it creates a paper trail,' Chopra writes. 'These illegal data practices were tools to lock in and advance the company's digital advertising dominance. Global regulators and policymakers need to confront the dangers associated with mass surveillance and the resulting ability to control and influence us.' That wasn't the only corporate giveaway from federal regulators today. The Justice Department let slip that it would approve the Sprint/T-Mobile merger[14], dropping the number of major national cell phone service providers from four to three. The order includes a divestment of some assets to Dish Network so that it can build its own cellular network. But this makes no sense on several levels. Sprint's argument was that it would wither without the support of T-Mobile; why would Dish, starting from scratch save for a paltry nine million prepaid customers, be expected to do any better? If Sprint was too small to effectively compete, why would creating a smaller fourth carrier[15] with no retail stores improve the situation? Dish already has possession of lots of wireless spectrum, yet never built out its own cellular network; that it would do so now seems unlikely. It would make more business sense for Dish to hold out and sell off spectrum to the highest bidder down the road, shrinking customer choice for cell phones. Only if Dish decides to leverage its satellite TV subscribers into bundling a cell phone package would competition be preserved, but at the cost of consolidating the telecom space and putting consumers at the whim of a single company for all of its communications. It's almost unconscionable that this consolidation would be waved through, just a few years after the Justice Department, under Obama, rejected AT... purchase of T-Mobile. The hoop-jumping to preserve competition could have been accomplished to better effect by simply rejecting the merger and letting Sprint sell its business on its own. Fortunately, 14 state attorneys general have sued[16] to block the deal, an example of the ability for states to pick up the slack when the federal government walks away from corporate consolidation. That trial starts in October. These failures are the lens through which to consider Tuesday's Justice Department commencement[17] of a review of the practices of digital platforms' market power, and whether they 'are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.' The antitrust division has simply given no reason to believe that this review will be in any way useful. Some dupes in the media[18] continue to fall for Donald Trump's rhetoric and meaningless announcements like the DOJ's, against all evidence. Matthew Buck and Sandeep Vaheesan dealt with the yawning gap between Trump's words and the actions of his administration in March in The New York Times[19]. In theory, Donald Trump is concerned about the tech giants' power[20], and accuses them of bias[21]; in practice, Big Tech in the Trump era has enjoyed huge corporate tax windfalls[22] and the benefits of antitrust enforcers intervening on their behalf in a series of cases. In its first few years, the Trump Justice Department has sided with Apple[23], Comcast[24], Uber, and Lyft[25]. Even if we're just going by Trump's statements, his press conference rant[26] last week about the squad castigated Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) for 'keeping Amazon out of New York,' referring to the company's walking away[27] from an alternate headquarters in Long Island City in exchange for billions of dollars in subsidies[28]. 'Would have been a great thing tens of thousands of jobs, and New York has not been the same since that happened.' Putting aside this being not true\u2014Long Island City is thriving without Amazon[29]\u2014Trump showed that his rhetoric veers wildly from moment to moment, and therefore means essentially nothing. In all things Trump, watch what he does, not what he tweets. And with Amazon hiring a prominent Trump bundler[30] as a lobbyist, the gulf between actions and words will likely only widen. Until the antitrust authorities prove that they aren't in the pocket of large corporations, we have to simply assume they are. There is real scrutiny being brought upon the Big Tech firms, but it's coming from House Democrats in Congress[31]. There is real scrutiny being brought upon Big Telecom, but it's coming from Democratic state attorneys general[32]. The Justice Department and the FTC have been almost entirely useless. Until they prove otherwise, don't mistake saber rattling for actual use of the saber.

It is about getting re-elected \u2014 and there are few better ways to rally his base than to rail on California liberals in Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president has little to lose by taking a shot at the San Francisco tech company and outfits such as Facebook because the Bay Area, as well as Silicon Valley and California in general, overwhelmingly supports Democrats, contributes to their campaigns and dislikes Trump. So Trump revs up his base by ripping on Big Tech \u2014 even though Big Tech helped get him elected.</p><p> Who said that? Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale.</p><p> Parscale said the Trump campaign raised much of its $250 million online haul in 2016 through a robust Facebook advertising push. He also said Trump had masterfully used Twitter to steer the media narrative during the campaign. The president is still using his 80 million-follower Twitter feed to shape the story \u2014 his feud with Jack Dorsey and company is competing this week for top billing with the nearly unfathomable milestone of 100,000 Americans killed by COVID-19.</p><p> \"Facebook and Twitter were the reason we won this thing,\" Parscale told Wired magazine in the days after Trump's 2016 election. \"Twitter for Mr. Trump. And Facebook for fundraising.\"</p><p> But that sort of nuance doesn't rile up Trump's GOP base. Railing on tech companies as biased against conservatives does.</p><p> A Morning Consult poll last year of Republicans found that 48% felt Facebook was biased against conservatives and 36% felt Twitter was anti-conservative. And that was before Twitter stuck \"fact checks\" debunking a pair of Trump's tweets this week making incorrect claims about California's plans to have a nearly all-mail election in November. That's what triggered Trump's order Thursday that would remove a provision of a 24-year-old federal law protecting tech companies from lawsuits over content on their platforms.</p><p> \"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers,\" Trump said before signing the order, referring to the \"tech monopoly\" that has \"unchecked power.\"</p><p> To Trump, railing on Silicon Valley generates the same reaction as pounding other \"elites\" like the media and Democratic governors who don't want to open the their states for business quickly enough. It's a well-worn tactic that has kept his conservative base with him through three-plus years in office.</p><p> \"California is an easy target for conservatives because of the image that we're 'freaky San Francisco' and Hollywood people,\" said Donnie Fowler, a former Democratic operative who has worked to bridge the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington for two decades and is now the CEO at Tech4America. \"It reinforces their messages.\"</p><p> Trump's latest blast at Silicon Valley started with another shot at California. On Tuesday, Trump took on Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to mail ballots to all California voters for the November election, breaking at least temporarily from the detente the two had stuck to during the pandemic.</p><p> Trump tweeted that \"there is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed.\"</p><p>Twitter pointed out, accurately in its fact check, that that is false. Evidence of voter fraud \"is very rare\" anywhere, including California, UC Irvine election law Professor Rick Hasen told The Chronicle's \"It's All Political\" podcast.</p><p> \"In the five states that use all-mail balloting \u2014 which include some heavily Republican states like Utah \u2014 the amount of election crime generally is very low,\" Hasen said.</p><p> That didn't matter to the president. Trump exploded after Twitter attached its fact check, tweeting that \"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom.\"</p><p> But Zack Graves, policy director at the libertarian-leaning Lincoln Network think tank that links Silicon Valley and Washington, said there's a disconnect between how many Republicans feel about bias at technology companies and how they feel about regulating them.</p><p> That Morning Consult poll last year of Republicans, which his group commissioned, found that 41% of respondents agreed that \"technology platforms should be free from government regulation regardless of political or ideological bias, because they are private companies.\" Forty percent said tech companies \"need to be regulated by the government to stop political or ideological bias.\"</p><p> \"My view is that conservatives are not upset by content moderation itself, they're distrustful of progressives in San Francisco having massive and opaque power over it,\" Graves said in an email Thursday.</p><p>Harvard government Professor Thomas Patterson doesn't think Trump \"is that fearful of Twitter. It's just a good excuse to go after them.\"</p><p> \"But he is very fearful, and rightfully so, of vote by mail,\" said Patterson, author of the new book \"Is the Republican Party Destroying Itself? And Why It Needs to Reclaim Its Conservative Ideals.\"</p><p> Why? Patterson thinks it's because Trump believes it could hurt his re-election chances by making it easier for more people to vote.</p><p> \"If you ever agreed to it,\" Trump told Fox News in March, \"you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\"</p><p> That, too, is untrue. Just ask California's newest member of Congress, Rep. Mike Garcia. The Republican businessman easily won a nearly all-mail House election in Southern California this month, flipping a seat that had been held by a Democrat, just hours after Trump told reporters that mail-in ballots were \"subject to tremendous corruption.
