If that information were stored as music files, it would play continuously for more than 100 years.</p><p><br/>And the more info the glass-encased building collects, the smarter it gets.<br/>\"We think of it as a computer with a roof on it,\" Jan-Hein Lakeman, executive managing director of developer Edge Technologies' U.S. operations, told The Real Deal.<br/>The 22-year-old firm, based in Amsterdam, recently co-developed a 325,000-square-foot office building in New Jersey as Unilever's North American headquarters - which also uses a cloud-based computing system and workplace sensors. And this year, Edge Technologies plans to announce its first project in New York City. Lakeman said the company is now looking at sites for either a ground-up development or an existing building that it can \"Edge-ify.\"<br/>The real estate industry - which has a reputation for being slow to adopt new technologies - is in the early stages of a tech transformation fueled, in part, by consumers wanting to be more connected. From landlords to property managers, companies across the industry are spending billions to outfit offices, residential properties and retail with new smart gadgets. And the information those devices are collecting is getting stored and Ping-Ponged across the web at increasingly faster speeds.<br/>Meanwhile, the latest advancements in artificial intelligence allow buildings to process and \"think\" about the information they've collected and make operational adjustments.<br/>But as real estate players in New York and beyond look to roll out new technologies like facial scanning and geolocation tracking, it's stoking new anxieties over science fiction levels of surveillance. On top of privacy concerns, smart buildings raise the risk of cyberhacks and data breaches, critics say.<br/>In this environment, lawmakers around the globe are pushing to impose tighter regulations. The European Union last year implemented the world's strictest data privacy law, and similar legislation will go into effect in California next year.<br/>\"The question is, where is that line between privacy and convenience: How much Big Brother am I afraid of?\" said Brian Zrimsek, a principal at MRI Software, a real estate management and investment software provider.<br/>In New York, those anxieties were thrust into the public spotlight in March, when it was revealed that Brooklyn landlord Nelson Management plans to install facial recognition technology at several of its rent-stabilized buildings around the city. Tenants at Nelson's Atlantic Plaza Towers complex in Brownsville filed an objection to the plan, citing a potential for violations of privacy and civil liberties.<br/>Nelson Management's Atlantic Plaza Towers\u00a0<br/>The company's president, Robert Nelson, said the technology will help the landlord fulfill one of its most important responsibilities: providing for the safety of his tenants.<br/>But he also acknowledged his tenants' concerns.<br/>\"I do understand the paranoia that exists,\" he said. \"Right now, it's new. But I would bet money that in 10 years it is going to be so commonplace all over the world.\"<br/>Tracking tenants<br/>The biggest surveillance case study is unfolding right on Manhattan's Far West Side at Hudson Yards.<br/>The Related Companies' mega-development collects so much data from residents, workers and tourists that it bills itself as the country's first \"quantified community.\"<br/>The $25 billion megaproject's office towers feature a biometric scanning technology called Pass that uses handprints to give tenants access. The 16-building site will also have a content management system including 30 kiosks with touch screens that can be used for things like booking a restaurant or buying tickets to the \"Vessel.\" But those kiosks will also be siphoning information from visitors, including their browser histories.<br/>In March, Related saw public blowback over the terms and conditions for its Vessel sculpture, which stated that all photos taken by visitors belonged to Related, giving the firm the right to license and sell them in perpetuity. The developer walked that policy back following the outcry.<br/>Jay Cross, who heads Related Hudson Yards, told TRD in March that he and his associates are still deciding how they'll use all of the data they're collecting. While Related has no plans to sell its user information for the time being, Cross signaled the company could do so in the future.<br/>\"We can do ... what we want with our data; we're not averse to using it to help the city map the West Side,\" he noted.<br/>Meanwhile, global brokerages like CBRE and JLL are investing heavily in new technologies that track and analyze what goes on inside office and retail spaces. CBRE, for example, buys geolocation data that other companies collect from mobile phones, and uses it to show retailers info about who visits particular locations. And co-working and co-living companies are \"programming\" properties for tenants, while a growing number of smart apartments are hitting the market.<br/>\"For a very long time, people have been promised the 'Minority Report'-esque level of technology in buildings,\" said Chase Garbarino, CEO of the property tech firm HqO.<br/>Garbarino, whose startup makes an app that commercial tenants can use to book conference rooms and schedule visitor access, among other things, said the smart-building evolution comes down to how many devices feed information to the cloud. \"A lot of these pieces are coming online now,\" he added.<br/>All of the data from the Edge in Amsterdam, for example, is fed into a Microsoft cloud platform, which tracks the movements and routines of the people inside by using an app on their phones.<br/>By 2022, 4 billion devices linked to the \"internet of things\" (IoT) - everyday gadgets that are increasingly becoming connected online - are expected to be in homes worldwide, while more than 3 billion are expected to be in office buildings, according to the smart-building research firm Memoori.<br/>The Vessel at Hudson Yards<br/>That disruption hasn't come without its share of apprehension.<br/>In Canada, for example, mall owner Cadillac Fairview stopped using facial recognition scanners at two of its Calgary shopping centers last summer after Reddit users discovered the technology could approximate visitors' ages and genders. Under Canadian privacy laws, visitors have the right to request that Cadillac Fairview stop collecting their data. But some argue that wasn't really an option, since the mall owner hadn't disclosed it was using the technology.<br/>The company, which is owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, is currently under investigation by Canada's privacy commissioner.<br/>Similarly, critics of Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs - Daniel Doctoroff's smart-cities planning firm - launched a #BlockSidewalk campaign protesting its surveillance at the 12-acre development known as Quayside, which the company is helping to build in Toronto.<br/>Jathan Sadowski, a researcher at the University of Sydney who studies smart systems, said buildings, and even entire cities, are becoming more like Facebook and Google when it comes to pushing the boundaries about how much and what kind of personal information they have on people.<br/>\"I wouldn't be surprised if we're witnessing the very beginnings of something that becomes the new normal,\" Sadowski said. \"The built environment having terms of service agreements.\"<br/>WeWatch<br/>Nothing encapsulates the We Company's casual culture and lofty ideas about the power of data quite like the T-shirt its executive David Fano wears with the motto \"bldgs = data\" printed on it. Fano - who trademarked the logo at a real estate consulting firm he launched before joining WeWork in 2015 - is one of the biggest proponents of optimizing work and living spaces by quantifying and analyzing occupants' routines.<br/>The info that WeWork compiles on its members includes their intellectual property such as trademarks and logos, companies and job titles, social media screen names, online calendars and passwords, relationships to emergency contacts and even their favorite foods and snacks. The company's surveillance also includes requests made through Amazon Echo as well as communications on Slack and email.<br/>And as Manhattan's largest private office tenant, the co-working giant is in a unique position to test its theories.<br/>\"We've kind of got this big petri dish of people working in different ways with each other across the globe and different time zones,\" Fano said during a conference at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School last spring. \"It's a physical social network, and people are always together all the time.\"<br/>The SoftBank-backed company, which late last month filed preliminary paperwork for a long-anticipated IPO, does indeed resemble a social network - at least in terms of its privacy policy. The membership agreement for 110 Wall Street, a WeLive co-living property, states that it collects extensive information from its members through their devices and their use of the space. By signing it, members agree to allow WeLive to use and share their personal data.<br/>The We Company has built up a massive infrastructure to collect data on its more than 400,000 members. In February, for example, it acquired Euclid, a startup it describes as a \"Google analytics for space\" that gathers troves of info on people through their Wi-Fi connections. The company's WeWork arm is also looking into using facial recognition and workplace sensors that track things like motion, temperature and Bluetooth check-ins.<br/>Bryan Murphy, CEO of the flex office space startup Breather, said he's seeing some members leave WeWork due, in part, to concerns about the company's privacy policies. Murphy acknowledged that Breather also collects a certain amount of data from its members, but said he has decided against using facial recognition and workplace sensors. And the company doesn't share its data with outside parties, he emphasized.<br/>\"That's actually part of our value proposition,\" Murphy said.<br/>A spokesperson for the We Company declined to comment for this story. But in the past, company executives have said the information is aggregated and anonymized - a common rebuttal to privacy concerns.<br/>The company also says the information helps improve its services. It does, however, reserve the right to share the data with other parties. While the identities of those parties are often masked in vague language, they generally include hired vendors and companies it partners with on transactions, including buying properties and other businesses.<br/>Stacy-Ann Elvy, a New York Law School professor who studies privacy and emerging technologies, said that kind of language comes with a big loophole.<br/>\"The company has the control to determine who gets access, so I don't think promising not to sell the data is bulletproof in terms of fully protecting consumers,\" she noted. \"If those provisions were as effective as [one would hope], we wouldn't have all these instances of companies selling our data to different parties.\"<br/>Decoding data<br/>Many of the real estate players who collect and use this kind of data claim they're looking only at big-picture trends, not at specific people. But many studies show that data can be decoded - or deanonymized, in surveillance-speak - and used to identify real people.<br/>In a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study published in December, researchers took an \"anonymized\" set of location stamps from mobile phone logs in Singapore and matched it up with riders' location stamps from the city's transit system. The researchers estimated they could positively identify 95 percent of the study's participants with 11 weeks' worth of data.<br/>\"I was at Sentosa Island in Singapore two days ago, came to the Dubai airport yesterday, and am on Jumeirah Beach in Dubai today. It's highly unlikely another person's trajectory looks exactly the same,\" MIT Prof. Carlo Ratti, one of the study's authors, wrote.<br/>\"In short, if someone has my anonymized credit card information, and perhaps my open location data from Twitter, they could then deanonymize my credit card data,\" he added.<br/>Studies have also shown that most people don't read privacy policies, and even if they did, it would take months to understand them. That's not to mention that most people have no choice but to accept that reality - unless they want to forgo having a phone, email account, social media presence or office job.<br/>By now, most people understand that visiting a website or downloading a free app comes at the price of handing over their information.<br/>There's a secretive industry built around the buying and selling of personal data, and the information from buildings is particularly useful to that market.<br/>Data brokers like Oracle, Experian, Equifax and a web of lesser-known names buy and sell personal data that's used for everything from marketing to checking a renter's credit history.<br/>But while websites can track online habits and phones can monitor locations, both have data limitations. Mobile phone tracking, for example, can tell when someone walks into a building. But it's not very good at determining if the phone is in a ground-floor restaurant or the observation deck of a skyscraper.<br/>Embedding these technologies in the buildings themselves can help fill in those gaps and\u00a0 turn people's everyday actions into data points.<br/>\"What's different is you get an inside window into what people are doing offline,\" New York Law School's Elvy said.<br/>\"If you were walking into the common area of your building, typically that's not viewed as data anyone would collect,\" she added. \"But now it is, because they know what time certain individuals are opening the door, and there's a detailed record of that.\"<br/>Greater good?<br/>Of course, the benefits go beyond bigger profits and greater control for individual firms. Smarter buildings can also potentially help save the planet.<br/>Nearly 40 percent of the country's carbon emissions comes from buildings, according to the Washington, D.C.-based independent nonprofit Environmental and Energy Study Institute. And just last month, the New York City Council passed sweeping legislation requiring large buildings to be retrofitted to reduce fossil fuel consumption by 2030.<br/>With the projected costs for New York landlords to come into compliance exceeding $4 billion, experts in the tech world say data-collecting sensors and AI - which can collect untold numbers of data points to spot places where buildings are wasting energy - can go a long way.<br/>\"It's very important for [property managers] to not waste their time looking for issues but dedicate their time out in the field to preventing and solving those issues,\" said Luca Tausel, of IBM's Watson unit, which creates the AI used in many smart buildings.<br/>In 2016, the family-run real estate firm Rudin Management launched its own tech startup, Prescriptive Data, which uses a cloud-based operating system in 17 of the developer's New York properties to more efficiently manage their water and electricity use, among other building systems. Last year, those properties recorded a 44 percent reduction in carbon emissions - more than the 40 percent reduction the City Council's law mandates over the next decade.<br/>Rudin's technology chief, John Gilbert, said Prescriptive Data anonymizes building information. And in the cases where it's put to use in buildings run by other landlords, he said, the data belongs to each property owner rather than to Rudin's tech company.<br/>More broadly, Gilbert noted that there are lots of lessons property owners can learn from Silicon Valley's privacy headaches.<br/>\"I think the Facebook lessons are hugely important,\" he said. \"The minute you allow others into your buildings to retrieve that data ... if they're not sharing that with you and if it's going out the backdoor and being monetized, you're not doing your job.\"<br/>At the same time, properties are increasingly adding devices that interact with buildings' occupants.<br/>The Stanwix in Bushwick, for example, bills itself as the smartest rental in Brooklyn.<br/>The 130-unit building, owned by JCS Realty, has a Control4 automation system that tenants can access through a wall panel or a mobile app to do things like alter the lighting and adjust blinds. Tenants can also use smartphones remotely to operate door locks and create a log of every time the lock is used - and who used it.<br/>The Stanwix uses a management system created by the cloud-based platform BuildingLink, and the tech is all linked to an Amazon Alexa provided by the landlord. A representative for JCS did not respond to requests for comment.<br/>Ari Teman, whose company makes video intercoms and smart locks, said tenants often want a certain level of surveillance.<br/>\"Surveillance can make you feel safe,\" added Teman, who said his technology is used in about 1,000 residential buildings in New York City. \"When I'm living in a building, I want the package area and the lobby entrances areas to be recorded and for cameras to be visible.\"<br/>Teman added, however, that data collection can certainly cross a line.<br/>\"If you want to take that data and sell it to some big company to tell about my love life, I find that creepy,\" he said.<br/>The Amazon effect<br/>In New York and other major cities, rentals, condos and single-family homes are linking to devices made by \"Big Tech\" companies at an increasing rate, reports show.<br/>Amazon announced in January that it had sold more than 100 million Alexa products around the globe, and an RBC analyst estimated late last year that Google had sold more than 52 million home devices worldwide.<br/>Tech behemoths like Amazon, Microsoft and IBM also run the cloud systems that many smart buildings use. Virtually all of those companies have reputations for pushing the privacy envelope - and, in turn, prompting laws to more carefully regulate the space.<br/>\"Lots of companies are now supplying what you will see in your apartment, in your home, on the wall,\" said Gordon Feller, co-founder of the smart-cities summit Meeting of the Minds. \"The goal is to deliver advertising to the end user, which is going to be a shock to a lot of people when they realize that.\"<br/>There's also just the looming fear that these devices are recording conversations people are having in their own homes. And there have been documented cases suggesting that it happens when signals cross.<br/>A family in Portland, Oregon, for instance, caught its Amazon Echo last year haphazardly recording one of their conversations, which it sent to one of their phone contacts, according to news reports.<br/>\"It's only natural that the likelihood of these types of incidents happening is only going to increase as the tech becomes more widespread,\" said attorney Kavon Adli, a partner at the Internet Law Group based in Los Angeles. \"New companies are coming on the scene pretty regularly, and there's no universal fix for these kinds of problems.\"<br/>Big Brother business<br/>It's not just rental landlords, shared-space providers and property managers buying into the smart-building market. Large commercial brokerages, construction firms and megadevelopers are investing billions in building analytics and other intelligent services.<br/>In real estate, the retail sector was among the first to adopt so-called alternative data. Landlords and commercial brokers purchased the people-tracking data from mobile phone companies and then provided retailers with intel on shopper demographics and foot traffic.<br/>Big real estate firms are now creating their own intelligent technologies.<br/>CBRE, for example, launched a workplace app last year that uses artificial intelligence to learn office tenants' patterns and make recommendations for them.<br/>There's even technology that uses accelerometers and gyroscopes in devices to monitor a construction worker's gait. If the hard hat gets drunk during lunch and stumbles back to the jobsite, the devices will detect the unusual movement and report it to the worksite's superintendent.<br/>Many argue that tech users and tenants are willing to trade some privacy for convenience. And companies face reputational risks if they betray customers' trust.<br/>\"If AT&amp;T is monitoring your cell phone service and using data to figure out what they can do to create a better experience so that you have less dropped calls or whatever, that's kind of okay,\" said K.P. Reddy of Shadow Ventures, an Atlanta-based venture capital firm focused on the proptech industry. Though selling that info isn't illegal, it's \"the big no-no,\" Reddy added.<br/>Most real estate players using Big Data say they're gathering info to provide better services and don't sell that data to third parties, including advertisers.<br/>But there are plenty of examples outside of real estate where companies have crossed the line.<br/>Verizon was caught last year selling its customers' locations to a prison phone company - which corrections officers used to find out, without getting warrants, who inmates were calling. In the wake of that revelation, Verizon, AT&amp;T and Sprint said they would all stop sharing information with certain third parties.<br/>And plenty of questions remain about who the data belongs to - the manufacturer of the devices, the building manager or the property owner. That's led to other questions, including who the data stays with when a property sells.<br/>Even when a company collects the data, it could change hands. In bankruptcies, for example, data can be sold off as an asset. A biometrics payment company called Pay by Touch filed for bankruptcy in 2007, and among its holdings was a database of 2 million fingerprints from people who bought gas and groceries using the technology. More recently, the IoT company Filip Technologies - which designed a smart locator for children so their families could stay in touch - filed for bankruptcy in 2016, selling off data about the parents and children who used its devices.<br/>While that largely stayed under the radar, other privacy battles are brewing.<br/>Airbnb, for one, sued the city of New York last year after it passed a law requiring the company to hand over data on its hosts, including their names, addresses and number of days they rented their homes.<br/>Airbnb argued there was no way to know what the city would do with the data. In January, a federal judge sided with the company, blocking the law from taking effect.<br/>Information the city sought includes \"personal data in which Airbnb has a reasonable expectation of privacy,\" and most hotels \"would balk at any suggestion that their patrons' privacy could be invaded in such a manner,\" the company's complaint read.<br/>A spokesperson for Airbnb declined to comment.<br/>Global backlash<br/>Just a few weeks after Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress in April 2018 about Facebook's privacy policies, Europe took a major step forward on regulating data privacy.<br/>The next month, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation - the toughest and most comprehensive legislation of its kind in the world - went into effect.<br/>Among its many rules, the law requires companies to get consent from people in the EU to process their data and gives those individuals the right to withdraw that consent at any time (see sidebar). It also requires companies that collect data to put security protections in place and gives people the right to have their data erased within 30 days.<br/>Many believe that similar federal legislation will eventually work its way to the U.S. But for now, cities and states are implementing their own laws.<br/>California passed a consumer privacy act last year, which goes into effect in 2020. That initiative - which requires companies to disclose how they collect data and what they do with it - was actually initiated by San Francisco real estate developer Alastair Mactaggart, who became concerned about Big Tech's surveillance.<br/>In New York state, there's a patchwork of privacy laws, but nothing as far-reaching.<br/>State Sen. Brad Hoylman is pushing his \"right to know\" legislation that would let consumers find out what kind of data companies are collecting and how it's being used, but it stops short of banning companies from selling personal information.<br/>And last fall, City Council member Ritchie Torres introduced a bill to regulate facial recognition technology, which he likened to a secret search.

'We're super excited about this office because it represents what we stand for[1],' said Dave Haroldsen, head of brand at Offerpad. 'One of our values here at Offerpad is 'homes not houses.' </p><p>'We're beyond properties; we don't talk about transactions. We're about the homes and the people that live in [them]. Today, we're celebrating what that represents to us, to Offerpad, and it's an exciting moment.' Offerpad is part of a growing PropTech trend[2] in the Valley, using technology to make real estate transactions simpler and easier for customers. Offerpad worked closely with Gov. Doug Ducey and Rep. Jeff Weninger (LD-17) to help pass a bill supporting PropTech companies in Arizona. 'That's a big deal,' Haroldsen said. 'It's a big deal for our state and our industry, and we're super excited about all the work that's being done.' Brian Bair, CEO and founder of Offerpad, thanked the guests for joining the celebration. 'It really means a lot to us to share the moment of our new 'house' and to have you guys here and sharing it with us,' Bair said. 'I'm so proud of the team and what we've done at Offerpad over the last few years   in a short period of time, really changing real estate.' Before the ribbon-cutting, Offerpad's most prominent guests offered a few words of praise. 'I think the success that you've enjoyed to date is a testament to the good people you have working here at Offerpad, and right now in Arizona things are booming,' Ducey said. 'Maricopa County is the fastest-growing county for the third year running, in the entire nation. There are 3,144 counties in this country, so that is quite a victory to claim three years in a row.' Ducey said the Phoenix metropolitan area, with a population of 4.8 million, is bigger than 26 other U.S. states. 'You know, 70 percent of the adults in Arizona were born somewhere else, and they moved to our state because it has a better quality of life, and it is one of the most welcoming and inviting places in the world, and now it is welcoming to entrepreneurs and businesses of the future,' Ducey said. 'I couldn't be more excited about what is ahead for Offerpad.' Weninger said he wanted to thank Offerpad for its contribution to the East Valley community and the investment the company made in Chandler. 'On the PropTech, it is an amazing concept; it was a new concept to me, but you're at the forefront of it, your company,' Weninger said. 'What we're doing   and what the governor has been working on since he got in there   is welcoming technology and other companies and saying 'we're open for business' without this regulatory construct that is so limiting to you. We're still safe, but we're going to allow companies to grow, and we're not going to just put up roadblocks and tell you that you've got to wait two years to do that.' Chandler Mayor Kevin Hartke said the Offerpad project is 'very important to us' and that he was glad the company chose Chandler for its headquarters. 'We believe this is not the last idea that's going to come out of the very talented and intelligent group that you've assembled and will continue to assemble,' Hartke said. 'We want to say that Chandler is open for business and that we're excited to see how we can continue to work with you.' Offerpad staff moved into the new headquarters in March from the company's Gilbert office, where Offerpad has resided since summer of 2015 and has since outgrown. Offerpad will run its corporate and Arizona market operations from the new headquarters, which is located on Germann Road between Loop-202 and Chandler Municipal Airport.

'We're super excited about this office because it represents what we stand for[1],' said Dave Haroldsen, head of brand at Offerpad. 'One of our values here at Offerpad is 'homes not houses.' </p><p>'We're beyond properties; we don't talk about transactions. We're about the homes and the people that live in [them]. Today, we're celebrating what that represents to us, to Offerpad, and it's an exciting moment.' Offerpad is part of a growing PropTech trend[2] in the Valley, using technology to make real estate transactions simpler and easier for customers. Offerpad worked closely with Gov. Doug Ducey and Rep. Jeff Weninger (LD-17) to help pass a bill supporting PropTech companies in Arizona. 'That's a big deal,' Haroldsen said. 'It's a big deal for our state and our industry, and we're super excited about all the work that's being done.' Brian Bair, CEO and founder of Offerpad, thanked the guests for joining the celebration. 'It really means a lot to us to share the moment of our new 'house' and to have you guys here and sharing it with us,' Bair said. 'I'm so proud of the team and what we've done at Offerpad over the last few years \u2014 in a short period of time, really changing real estate.' Before the ribbon-cutting, Offerpad's most prominent guests offered a few words of praise. 'I think the success that you've enjoyed to date is a testament to the good people you have working here at Offerpad, and right now in Arizona things are booming,' Ducey said. 'Maricopa County is the fastest-growing county for the third year running, in the entire nation. There are 3,144 counties in this country, so that is quite a victory to claim three years in a row.' Ducey said the Phoenix metropolitan area, with a population of 4.8 million, is bigger than 26 other U.S. states. 'You know, 70 percent of the adults in Arizona were born somewhere else, and they moved to our state because it has a better quality of life, and it is one of the most welcoming and inviting places in the world, and now it is welcoming to entrepreneurs and businesses of the future,' Ducey said. 'I couldn't be more excited about what is ahead for Offerpad.' Weninger said he wanted to thank Offerpad for its contribution to the East Valley community and the investment the company made in Chandler. 'On the PropTech, it is an amazing concept; it was a new concept to me, but you're at the forefront of it, your company,' Weninger said. 'What we're doing \u2014 and what the governor has been working on since he got in there \u2014 is welcoming technology and other companies and saying 'we're open for business' without this regulatory construct that is so limiting to you. We're still safe, but we're going to allow companies to grow, and we're not going to just put up roadblocks and tell you that you've got to wait two years to do that.' Chandler Mayor Kevin Hartke said the Offerpad project is 'very important to us' and that he was glad the company chose Chandler for its headquarters. 'We believe this is not the last idea that's going to come out of the very talented and intelligent group that you've assembled and will continue to assemble,' Hartke said. 'We want to say that Chandler is open for business and that we're excited to see how we can continue to work with you.' Offerpad staff moved into the new headquarters in March from the company's Gilbert office, where Offerpad has resided since summer of 2015 and has since outgrown. Offerpad will run its corporate and Arizona market operations from the new headquarters, which is located on Germann Road between Loop-202 and Chandler Municipal Airport.

But it does signal a healthier year for venture capitalists, lawyers, investment bankers and corporate executives involved in high-tech M&amp;A.\"</p><p>Well, the opening of the IPO market to technology companies did indeed make M&amp;A more plentiful in 2004. Brightmail Inc.and Advertising.com Inc., for example, cut sales transactions while their IPO filings were sitting at the regulators' office. Others were able to leverage the activity into a sale before even filing.</p><p>While there weren't as many large-scale mergers and acquisitions in 2004 as predicted a year ago, last year was indeed the best year for tech M&amp;A since 2000. Here's a complete rundown of our 2004 predictions versus reality. (For our 2005 predictions, see last week's issue.)</p><p>Prediction: A wealth of $1B mergers</p><p>Reality: A wealth of sub-$1B mergers</p><p>Large technology M&amp;A was scarce in 2004. Instead of 10-figure deals, industry giants responsible for driving large transactions in recent years such as EMC Corp.and Yahoo! Inc. focused on smaller acquisitions. Cisco Systems Inc.cut 11 deals, none larger than $500 million. In the end, there were only six technology deals worth more than $1 billion (see chart).</p><p>Prediction: IBM does two big deals</p><p>Reality:IBM did one big deal</p><p>IBM Corp.did sell its money-losing PC business to Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd.in a first of its kind transaction valued at $1.75 billion, though that wasn't at all what we expected Big Blue to do. On the buy side, IBM focused on smaller software transactions rather than blockbuster acquisitions, ending the year with a total of nine deals: middleware-focused Trigo Technologies Inc. and Candle Corp.; business intelligence company AlphaBlox Corp.; application manager Cyanea Systems Inc.; business integration company Venetica Inc.; and enterprise portfolio management company Systemcorp.</p><p>Prediction:Juniper does one big deal</p><p>Reality:Juniper did one major deal</p><p>Bingo! On Feb. 9, Juniper Networks Inc. announced its intention to purchase neighboring network security company NetScreen Technologies Inc. for $3.5 billion. We said last year: \"With few markets aside from its high-speed core and edge routing products now prospering \u2014 and having failed to crack the cable broadband arena with its Pacific Broadband acquisition last year \u2014 Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Juniper will spend its way into a new marketplace.\" That about sums up Juniper's entry into the network security sector.</p><p>Prediction: EU tech titans on sidelines</p><p>Reality: EU tech titans stay on sidelines</p><p>The European Union's big tech companies remained unwilling to pull the trigger on big deals. Whether it's SAP AG, Siemens AG or Infineon AGof Germany, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson of Sweden, Nokia Oyj of Finland, Geneva-based STMicroelectronics NV or Alcatel SA of France, none have closed big acquisitions in recent years. 2004 was no exception. Instead, they've all stuck to their well-worn strategy of pursuing smaller deals. As predicted here last year, Nokia attempted to gain control of British mobile software operating system developer Symbian Ltd., and Siemens and Alcatel pursued sub-$500 million acquisitions.</p><p>Prediction:Yahoo! &amp; eBay merge</p><p>Reality: Didn't happen</p><p>Yahoo! Inc.and eBay Inc. maintained their momentum in 2004. Yahoo! was busy integrating Overture Services Inc. and picking up new features such as a European shopping comparison engine and a digital music service. EBay continued expanding into Asia while inching into nonauction business with its investment into San Francisco-based online bulletin board Craigslistand acquisitions of Dutch classifieds company Markt\u00adplaats.nl and Santa Monica, Calif.-based home rental service Rent.com Inc. In 2004 there turned out to be little motivation for either company to venture into a big merger when the businesses were doing so well in their respective business arenas.</p><p>Prediction: Oracle buys BEA; PeopleSoft bid lags</p><p>Reality: Oracle considered buying BEA; PeopleSoft bid lagged, then triumphed</p><p>After a 12-month struggle, Oracle Corp. gained control of Pleasanton, Calif.-based enterprise software maker PeopleSoft Inc.on Dec. 29. And while Oracle didn't buy BEA Systems Inc., its interest in the San Jose, Calif.-based maker of so-called infrastructure software was (and remains) serious. In court testimony, Redwood Shores, Calif.-based Oracle confirmed it had done research on acquiring seven companies, including BEA.</p><p>Prediction: Veritas also duels for BEA</p><p>Reality: Veritas merged with Symantec</p><p>The predicted duel for BEA didn't materialize, but the trend behind the prediction certainly did.</p><p>Prediction: HP buys Kodak</p><p>Reality: HP wisely did no such thing</p><p>Not much to say here except that Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard Co. smartly shied away from large acquisitions and Eastman Kodak Co.of Rochester, N.Y., busied itself with integrating the two digital imaging companies it purchased in 2003 for $750 million.</p><p>Prediction: IT security and storage M&amp;A sizzles</p><p>Reality:IT security and storage M&amp;A sizzled (and converged)</p><p>As predicted, the pace of activity in these sectors quickened. Cupertino, Calif.-based Symantec Corp. announced the largest acquisition of the year (Veritas Software Corp.), while Sunnyvale, Calif.-based NetScreen Technologies Inc. was acquired by Juniper in the second-largest information technology security deal of the year. On the storage front, neither XIOtech Inc. of Eden Prairie, Minn., nor Brocade Communications Systems Inc.of San Jose, Calif., were acquired as predicted, but larger companies such as San Jose-based Cisco Systems Inc., which acquired Actona Technologies Inc. for $82 million in June, and Hopkinton, Mass.-based EMC Corp., which purchased backup systems maker Dantz Development Corp. for $50 million and network systems management company Smarts Inc. for $260 million, did stay busy.</p><p>Prediction: Network hardware companies go cheap</p><p>Reality: Network hardware companies went cheap</p><p>This was an easy prediction. With so much venture money sitting idle \u2014 earning nothing for limited partners \u2014 and with scores of communications equipment companies in turmoil, it was inevitable that some would avoid bankruptcy through fire sales.</p><p>Among the deals done at deflated valuations: Paris-based Alcatel SA bought Richardson, Texas-based Spatial Wireless Inc. for $250 million; and Avaya Inc., a Basking Ridge, N.J.-based communications equipment gear maker, purchased German rival Tenovis GmbH &amp; Co. KG for $635 million.</p><p>Even the largest network hardware acquisition of the year was at a deflated valuation. Petaluma, Calif.-based Advanced Fibre Communications Inc.'s $1.4 billion sale to Tellabs Inc. of Naperville, Ill., was for $16.35 per share even though the company's shares began the year above $20.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-1105475638803</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4F83-R250-TWK1-92BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1209\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Deal, L.L.C.</copyright><publicationName>Daily Deal/The Deal</publicationName><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.TheDeal.com\">http://www.TheDeal.com</url><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>January 17, 2005 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001P56</classCode><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0009A96</classCode><className>LENOVO GROUP LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0001V67</classCode><className>EMC CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002D0X</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0009DIT</classCode><className>SALESFORCE.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001T6V</classCode><className>YAHOO!

JPY is a great hedge in a currency portfolio to protect against sudden spikes in risk aversion.</p><p>\"Still, the fundamental backdrop has not changed and will continue to underpin the uptrend in risk assets. The global economy is recovering, liquidity remains plentiful and central banks have been successful in containing financial market stress. Moreover, a second wave of coronavirus infections may not necessarily reverse the current economic recovery partly because there is unlikely to be the political appetite to reinstate economy-wide lockdowns.</p><p>\"AUD/USD has recovered above US69c after reaching a low overnight around US68c. Technically, AUD/USD remains vulnerable to a pullback towards its next two important support levels at US67.50c and US66.65c (the 200-day moving average). We would look to start accumulating AUD/USD on weakness closer to US67.50c,\" the CBA Global Markets Research team said.</p><p>\"In our view, AUD/USD can edge higher to US72c by year-end supported by broad USD weakness, resilient commodity prices, Australia's favourable balance of payments backdrop and RBA/Fed balance sheet expansion. The RBA is tapering purchases of Australian government bonds. In contrast, the Fed continues increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> 8.12pm: </emphasis>               HomeBuilder completely baffles Harry Triguboff            </p><p>Multi-billionaire property developer Harry Triguboff is among several real estate players strongly critical of the federal government's $680m HomeBuilder stimulus package, which he claims favours house-and-land buyers over city apartment purchasers and developers.</p><p>The apartment mogul and founder of Meriton, which is building thousands of units on the eastern seaboard, says the package favours house-and-land buyers on city fringes and regional areas even though most new homes completed in Sydney are units.</p><p>\"This decision completely baffles us because 68 per cent of new homes completed in Sydney are actually apartments. This is where the jobs are,\" Mr Triguboff said.</p><p>In a statement to The Weekend Australian, Mr Triguboff questioned why the government was trying to manipulate the housing market by setting price caps that excluded certain areas and dwelling types. \"Once again, the government has provided a stimulus which clearly discriminates between housing types,\" he said.</p><p>In announcing the HomeBuilder stimulus package the government is trying to counter a predicted downturn in construction demand.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/stimulus-overlooks-units/news-story/be80ff1ad01183b90c93c69deaab8c0b\">Read more</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> 7.49pm: </emphasis>               What Virgin bidders are fighting over            </p><p>The funniest - sick - joke going around at the moment is the idea that we have two groups in an auction to buy Virgin; to take their chances on running a weak second airline against the dominant, financially strong and superbly structured and focused Qantas, into the challenges and monumental uncertainties facing airlines in the post-virus world.</p><p>In fact, the only thing they are \"bidding\" to buy is the right to get a range of other parties to donate their money to ensure that one of these Wall Street vultures can extract the greatest profit with the least risk and indeed the smallest financial contribution from the Virgin carcass.</p><p>The latest group who they want to put their hands in their pockets to ensure higher profits for them is you - the taxpayer.</p><p>They want the government to give them - either Bain Capital or Cyrus - another $180m or so by exclusively extending JobKeeper for Virgin Two. To have the taxpayer effectively pay the airline's salary bill for the first six months of its life under its new owner.</p><p>The best way to understand what is going on in the auction behind closed doors is by way of this example: consider two people bidding to buy a house worth around, say $2m.</p><p>The one offering, say, $2.01m ends up winning over the other bid of, say, $2m flat. The $2.01m is paid; they own the house free and clear.</p><p>In the Virgin case the $2m \"house\" comes with a, say, $4m linked mortgage. It also comes with an order to spend $1m in mandatory repairs.</p><p>Clearly no one in their right mind would happily pay the $2m for the house, only to also pick up an immediate $5m liability.

So many closed up and we were not getting paid as well,\" Schirato tells The Weekend Australian. \"It was literally half our business gone straight away. There's no doubt I drew on some of my previous experiences ... and my son actually started listening to me as well.</p><p>\"But all the millennials have learned a lot in this period, a lot more than you can teach.\"</p><p>Schirato is joking when he refers to 38-year-old Rolando that way, though his son had only just been born when Schirato was trying to save the business in the early 80s during a credit squeeze. It was debt laden and Schirato would have dinner at the factory every night for almost a decade working to save Vittoria, paying back the banks and also slowly buying out other shareholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/supermarket-push-saves-vittoria-chief-les-schiratos-business/news-story/2c6284504b95511655baad5007642d64\">Read more</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> 6.51pm: </emphasis>               What now for co-working space stocks?            </p><p>In the new era of germ awareness, co-working spaces have transformed from a booming sector to a public health hazard.</p><p>Exalted as a creative collaborative zone in the industry's millennial-friendly jargon, the humble tea room is now maligned as a \u00adpotential virus super spreader.</p><p>The lockdown conditions have not augured well for the office sector overall, but have been particularly virulent for the co-working (or flexible) space providers. While traditional tenants are tied to a long lease, most co-working tenants are on rolling arrangements and free to leave without penalty.

Edited excerpts from an interview:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What are your plans for India?</p><p>We have been here for a long time. We are a trade-related bank. The way we operate has changed over time. New technology, different commodities, different things gets traded. Actually what is important is that the relationship India has with Australia and the rest of the world, has changed dramatically. We keep modifying our approach, but at the end of the day, we are here because we have two essential customer bases-Indian customers who are engaged with the rest of the world, which is growing dramatically, and large multinational companies from Australia or Japan, the US and Korea, who want to invest in India. Our job is to facilitate that. Our presence here is growing. We are never going to take on the big banks in India. So, in some ways, it is going to be a niche business, but fast-growing. Some of our largest customers in the world are from India.</p><p>India is betting big on digital. How do you plan to cash in on that?</p><p>We spent time with three fintech startups today who were in the SME (small and medium enterprises) financing space using blockchain, etc. There is no doubt a bit of a revolution is happening around the world. The cost of technology is coming down, the cost of big data is coming down, regulation is helping, deregulation in many places leading to open data and other things. There's going to be a new wave of innovation, not all of it is going to work out. But I think that's pretty exciting. Banks like us are threatened by these things because we are 187 years old, or we can find those things (as) exciting opportunities.</p><p>The idea that these fintech firms will come and take our business away, I don't subscribe to this. We have got millions and millions of loyal customers.</p><p>The real opportunity rather than competing is working together. So, what banks like us do is to partner with fintechs. They become service providers to us. We may partner with them and, sometimes, we may find some piece of equity, and that's not really the point. I think the real threat to the banking sector globally doesn't come from fintech. It comes from big tech. It is the Facebooks, Apples, and the Amazons who are expanding into our business and, again, the competition is healthy, and it will be good for consumers.</p><p>What meetings did you have thus far?</p><p>We have met some government officials and also spent some time with CII (Confederation of Indian Industry). That was interesting because the topic and the interest was around sustainability, in terms of finance, what is the role of banking and finance in supporting sustainability, which Australia has really become a leader in. There was a lot of interest in energy companies, manufacturing companies in what they could learn. For example, most of us think of sustainability as climate change. Actually, from an investor's point of view, it is a bit broader sense, which would include diversity. There are a lot of investors who care about how their money gets utilized and making sure it is doing some social good or environmental good, as well as is it generating returns. So, they still want a return. They do not want to accept a lower return, so they want to know what their money is achieving. So, there has been a development in Australia, among other countries, of these social bonds, green bonds, sustainable loans. As banks, we connect investors with those needs or interests to those who need the money. For example, a company may borrow money with the distinct purpose of using that to develop renewable energy. The one we just did for Sydney Airport, which was the first, was interesting because it was a sustainable loan. And, they sign up to a bunch of targets, and investors hold them to account. If they achieve those targets, the rate of interest goes down, if they don't achieve those targets, the rate of interest goes up-to try and nudge them to do the right thing. Some of them have to meet diversity targets, some of them have to meet emission targets. So, we were just sharing our experience, what some of the key ingredients of our success have been.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Electronic closing is the end of the game in terms of creating a marketable security instrument and note.</p><p>It's really just one piece of our overall technology environment that we believe capstones an effort to downstream as much control over the lending transaction as we prudently can do to make our mortgage brokers as efficient as possible.</p><p>The overall approach we're taking within our technology environment is governed by the principles to the extent that we can independently verify data from trusted third parties, that we should rely upon that data vs. what a broker may tell us to make a lending decision and a funding decision. Our goal is to bring together into a single place substantially all of the data necessary to make a risk assessment and therefore an underwriting, or approval, or funding decision electronically to facilitate the entire transaction electronically where we instantaneously at funding have a marketable asset.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: How does an e-closing exactly work at AmTrust?</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: We offer a fully integrated, completely electronic e-closing as it relates to those documents that the law permits to be e-signed or that we view as legally enforceable as e-signed documents. As an example, with a conforming fixed-rate loan, roughly 75% of the documents that are brought to the closing table in paper form for a wet signature are now e-signed under our approach. There still is a subset of documents that require a wet signature because the entity where they're going to end up does not accept an e-signature or we don't feel comfortable in those cases that that is the right way to go.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: If I'm a borrower how does it work for me?</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: Our borrowers, or our broker's borrowers to clarify, still go to a closing agent just as they would ordinarily, except today instead of sitting with a pen and a stack of papers, they sit comfortably with their closing agent and are literally reviewing documents online, acknowledging their review and clicking a button that says they accept, which instantaneously creates the appropriate digitized electronic signature. It's a digitally encoded series of characters that's unique to that signature and not something that looks like a signature on a piece of paper. It's instantly shipped to our e-vault and instantly shipped in the case of a loan sale and recordation to MERS.</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: You can think about it like this: there is no literal signature, you have a graphic signature. It's a click-through signature. So, literally I would click \"Yes, I accept\" or \"No, I don't accept\" and that acts as the acknowledgement just as you would have a wet signature as an acknowledgement. To make a long story short, it's literally like going online a buying things when you agree to certain terms. We do this essentially on every document except the mortgage.</p><p>There are some disclosures that we don't do either, but the vast majority of documents, 80%, are e-enabled through this technology. The most important thing to note is that this enables us to sell the loan immediately. From a credit perspective, it's all the documents you need to have that end collateral get monetized.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: A lot of the industry is waiting for an e-mortgage foreclosure or some kind of lawsuit to validate the legality of this approach despite the fact that there is existing legislation to support an e-transaction. What's your take on this debate?</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: We think there's zero debate because these are all Fannie Mae eligible loans, they believe the enforceability is there and we're going to go with that. I don't mean to over simplify it, but it really is as simple as that. If Fannie Mae is behind it and that's who the loan is sold to, who are we to debate Fannie Mae?</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: Certainly Fannie Mae's blessing makes it more comfortable for us to execute because they are allowing our collateral to sit behind the mortgage-backed securities that they issue on our behalf. Not withstanding that, the electronic signature legislation is very clear and the process that we have set up is consistent with the law and all of its many regulations.</p><p>So, on its merit, we're good to go. The fact that the mortgage is still wet-signed will make it pretty hard for a consumer to say they went to the closing, signed a wet mortgage and it's not good. If everything was done online, maybe there would be some concern, but when you throw in that some of the documents are wet signed in conjunction with the e-signing, it's rock solid.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: What's the return on investment associated with doing hybrid e-closings?</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: There's a couple of ways to look at return on investment. If you're looking at it from the standpoint of, we go ahead and build the technology, do the training, deploy it all, and therefore back-room costs go down by X, you're probably not going to see a big return on investment. We make the joke that for the thousands of loans we've done this way, we probably have 100 times the national average in cost because it's still an emerging technology.</p><p>The reality is that at some point we make a conscious and deliberate decision that this is the way of the future. It's not a matter of what is the ROI, it's a matter of we need to be in this space at any cost. We can list a lot of benefits like our warehouse times are shorter, our inefficiencies are less, it's great customer service, we have a greater velocity of loans being sold, our operational costs have gone down, our correspondents can go in and originate more loans without focusing on back-office stuff, etc.</p><p>We probably could do a halfway decent job in trying to quantify all those elements, but let's look at the endgame, which is that the mortgage process will be electronic and automated. From our standpoint, to figure how to do it and how to do it better then anyone else is something we're willing to invest in for the future.</p><p>The ROI is not necessarily savings, it'll be the $20 billion or more in loans that we'll do because we have a solution that is better. That's where our heads are at on this issue. Those companies that are debating ROI are missing the big picture.</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: All else equal, the greater number of transactions that we push down the e-pathway means that for the same dollar amount of capital we can support two or three or four times the number of new loans. If the margins are equal, and I can do four times more loans for the same capital, I'm going to make more money. The numbers get very compelling when you look at it this way.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: Another argument is that borrowers aren't ready to e-sign on their mortgage. Is that something that you've noticed? </p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: I debated this with Jon in a meeting a few hours ago because of the thousands of mortgages we've done this way only one or two have opted out.</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: Of the transactions we've done, Peter is dead on. Are borrowers going to their lender or closing agent and saying they want an e-closing? Not at this point in time. Do they object when presented with an e-closing? Absolutely not. In fact, the feedback we're getting is that this was pleasant, it was easy, it was simple, it was much faster, what a refreshing surprise not be faced with 100 pieces of paper, etc.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: How do you market this in order to get traction and gain a competitive advantage?</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: The biggest marketing engine is the fact that we have it. No other lender has the full-blown suite that we have. We have tried many techniques in terms of marketing the package and some have been successful and have resonated and some have not worked as well.</p><p>We believe after having been at this aggressively for about two years, much more earnest in the past nine months, the No. 1 ticket to success is people-on-people sales management of the process. No marketing spin seems to have the impact that a one-on-one, hands-on management of the go-to-market effect.</p><p>We have an expression here that talks about the power of one. If in the first month everyone of our executives signs up a new client on e-sign, and two the second month, three the third month, etc., this is just a hypothetical, but if you do that across the country with 100 account executives you can get the geometric expression going and the numbers escalate very rapidly. It's a grassroots, localized conversation that has to occur between AmTrust, our correspondent or broker, and their closing agent.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: What percentage of your volume is done this way and where do you expect that number to go in the near future?</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: We don't characterize our business in terms of percentages and numbers like that. However, we do know that you could add up the entire industry, in terms of public information released through MERS, in terms of e-transactions done and our numbers would eclipse that by several factors. We are seeing 15% to 20% monthly compounded growth in our numbers.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: Where do you fall on the PDF vs. Category One SMART Doc debate? Given that you're dealing with Fannie Mae I'm assuming that you're doing Category One.</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: The e-note is at a different level of XML, SMART Doc, tamper seal. All of the other documents are in PDF. It depends upon which doc you're talking about. Certain disclosures are OK as PDFs, but with the note we chose to do a true SMART Doc. It's not a blanket one vs. the other. We make the decision on a doc-by-doc basis because the note is different when compared to a rider. I'd say a PDF is at a lower level, but it would be overkill to SMART Doc everything the same as the note. </p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: What do you think are AmTrust's big tech milestones?</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: We don't look at it from that standpoint really. We look at it in such a way that we have technologically enabled our customers to do more with less. It's not just about electronic closing, it's about the submission of the loan, automated underwriting, the ability to order your own funds, and so on. The e-closing is just one piece.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: With market conditions being what they are, how can technology help mortgage lenders that are hurting right now?</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: Unless a computer can appraise a loan and tell us if someone is misrepresenting their assets, I don't see any immediate lift, other then encouraging everyone to take advantage of existing technologies as they relate to fraud detection. Technology isn't the silver bullet in this market or any other.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: How will these declining market conditions impact technology spending?</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: It will redirect dollars to make sure organizations have properly shored up their collateral valuation, underwriting and fraud-focused technologies. At least that will be the initial focus.</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: You have a lot of companies contemplating survival, contemplating if they should even be in this business. So, proactive spend on technology probably won't happen. Overall spending will be less until everything fleshes out, because the last thing companies on the brink of going out business are going to be worrying about is an e-note. However, those companies get themselves in an even deeper hole because the market is still moving forward, and they just fall farther and farther behind.</p><p>As the lending industry debates the return on investment and legality of e-mortgages, AmTrust has been there and done that.

From a credit perspective, it's all the documents you need to have that collateral get monetized.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: A lot of the industry is waiting for an e-mortgage foreclosure or some kind of lawsuit to validate the legality of this approach despite the fact that there is existing legislation that supports the legality of an e-transaction. What's your take on this debate?</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: We think there's zero debate because these are all Fannie Mae eligible loans, they believe the enforceability is there and we're going to go with that. I don't mean to over simplify it, but it really is as simple as that. If Fannie Mae is behind it and that's who the loan is sold to, who are we to debate Fannie Mae?</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: Certainly Fannie Mae's blessing makes it more comfortable for us to execute because they are allowing our collateral to sit behind the mortgage-backed securities that they issue on our behalf. Not withstanding that, the electronic signature legislation is very clear and the process that we have set up is consistent with the law and its regulations. So, on its merit, we're good to go. The fact that the mortgage is still wet signed will make it pretty hard for a consumer to say they went to the closing, signed a wet mortgage and it's not good. If everything was done online, maybe there would be some concern, but when you throw in that some of the documents are wet signed in conjunction with the e-signing, it's rock solid.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: What's the return on investment associated with doing hybrid e-closings? </p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: There's a couple of ways to look at return on investment. If you're looking at it from the standpoint of, we go ahead and build the technology, do the training, deploy it all, and therefore back-room costs go down by X, you're probably not going to see a big return on investment. We make the joke that for the thousands of loans we've done this way, we probably have 100 times the national average in cost because it's still an emerging technology. The reality is that at some point we make a conscious and deliberate decision that this is the way of the future. It's not a matter of what is the ROI, it's a matter of we need to be in this space at any cost. We can list a lot of benefits like our warehouse times are shorter, our inefficiencies are less, it's great customer service, we have a greater velocity of loans being sold, our operational costs have gone down, our correspondents can go in and originate more loans without focusing on back-office stuff, etc. We probably could do a halfway decent job in trying to quantify all those elements, but let's look at the endgame, which is that the mortgage process will be electronic and automated. From our standpoint, to figure how to do it and how to do it better then anyone else is something we're willing to invest in for the future. The ROI is not necessarily savings, it'll be the $20 billion or more in loans that we'll do because we have a solution that is better so our customers can be faster, quicker, more efficient. That's where our heads are at on this issue. Those companies that are debating ROI are missing the big picture.</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: All else equal, the greater number of transactions that we push down the e-pathway means that for the same dollar amount of capital we can support two or three or four times the number of new loans. If the margins are equal, and I can do four times more loans for the same capital, I'm going to make more money. The numbers get very compelling when you look at it this way.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: Another argument is that borrowers aren't ready to e-sign on their mortgage. Is that something that you've noticed?</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: I debated this with Jon in a meeting a few hours ago because of the thousands of mortgages we've done this way only one or two have opted out. I'd say we've gotten 99.9% acceptance.</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: Of the transactions we've done, Peter is dead on. Are borrowers going to their lender or closing agent and saying they want an e-closing? Not at this point in time. Do they object when presented with an e-closing? Absolutely not. In fact, the feedback we're getting is that this was pleasant, it was easy, it was simple, it was much faster, what a refreshing surprise not be faced with 100 pieces of paper, etc.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: How do you market this in order to get traction and gain a competitive advantage?</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: The biggest marketing engine is the fact that we have it. No other lender has the full-blown suite that we have. We have tried many techniques in terms of marketing the package and some have been successful and resonated and some have not. We believe after having been at this aggressively for about two years, much more earnest in the past nine months, the No. 1 ticket to success is people-on-people sales management of the process. No marketing spin seems to have the impact that a one-on-one, hands-on management of the go-to-market effect. We have an expression here that talks about the power of one. If in the first month everyone of our executives signs up a new client on e-sign, and two the second month, three the third month, etc., this is just a hypothetical, but if you do that across the country with 100 account executives you can get the geometric expression going and the numbers escalate very rapidly. It's a grassroots, localized conversation that has to occur between AmTrust, our correspondent or broker, and their closing agent.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: What percentage of your volume is done this way and where do you expect that number to go in the future?</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: We don't characterize our business in terms of percentages and numbers like that. However, we do know that you could add up the entire industry, in terms of public information released through MERS, in terms of e-transactions done and our numbers would eclipse that by several factors. We are seeing 15% to 20% monthly compounded growth in our numbers.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: Where do you fall on the PDF vs. Category One SMART Doc debate? Given that you're dealing with Fannie Mae I'm assuming that you're doing Category One.</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: The e-note is at a different level of XML, SMART Doc, tamper seal. All of the other documents are in PDF. It depends upon which doc you're talking about. Certain disclosures are OK as PDFs, but with the note we chose to do a true SMART Doc. It's not a blanket one vs. the other. We make the decision on a doc-by-doc basis because the note is different when compared to a rider. I'd say a PDF is at a lower level, but it would be overkill to SMART Doc everything on the same level as the note.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: What do you think are AmTrust's big technology milestones? What contribution do you think AmTrust has made to prompt the industry to adopt new technologies?</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: At the end of the day we're not Mother Teresa or Nelson Mandela, looking to do something that's going to thrust the banking technology industry. We don't look at it from that standpoint. We look at it in such a way that we have technologically enabled our customers to do more with less. It's not just about e-closing, it's about submission of the loan, automated underwriting, the ability to order your own funds, etc. The e-closing is just one piece. If you ask our customers, they would say that we've given them the tools, the technology, the support, that allows them to do as much or more then the biggest retail lenders so they can go toe to toe and win. That's how we value what we've done.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: With market conditions being what they are, how can technology help lenders that are hurting now?</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: Unless a computer can appraise a loan and tell us if someone is misrepresenting their assets, I don't see any immediate lift, other then encouraging everyone to take advantage of existing technologies as they relate to fraud detection. Technology isn't the silver bullet that's going to solve the industry's morass, which in hindsight was the result of irresponsible lending practices and guidelines. We're just trying to make loans that make sense for the people and their families. The industry went beyond that because there was a financial market place and now everyone understands that over-reaching for the sake of excess profits is not a good thing.</p><p>MORTGAGE TECHNOLOGY: How will these market conditions impact technology spending?</p><p>JON BAYMILLER: It will redirect dollars to make sure organizations have properly shored up their collateral valuation, underwriting and fraud-focused technologies. At least that will be the initial focus.</p><p>PETER GOLDBERG: You have a lot of companies contemplating survival, contemplating if they should even be in this business. So, proactive spend on technology probably won't happen. Overall spending will be less until everything fleshes out, because the last thing companies on the brink of going out business are going to be worrying about is an e-note. However, those companies get themselves in an even deeper hole because the market is still moving forward, and they just fall farther and farther behind.</p><p>Spotlight on PETER GOLDBERG</p><p>Mr. Goldberg is only the eighth president of AmTrust Bank, which was founded in 1889.

Not long ago, it was almost universally accepted that new innovations would improve society, create enormous economic opportunities and cut down barriers.\u00a0Now, it seems harder to be optimistic about technology than at any time in recent history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rise of fake news and the use of the internet as a tool to spread division, the threats of mass surveillance and privacy violations, and fears that artificial intelligence will take our jobs or worse mean more people are increasingly sceptical of technology-induced change.</p><p>Meanwhile, Silicon Valley's giants have suffered a market crash, simmering protest and the growing threat of regulation. The conversation around tech in 2018 has been concerned with how to rein it in, rather than support it.\u00a0</p><p>Those stories have been told in these pages as much as elsewhere.

The graphics processing unit, or GPU, has become central to modern computing tasks such as image recognition and artificial intelligence. And the processing power of these chips is accelerating dramatically.</p><p>The latest <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/05/ces-2017-moores-law-not-dead-says-intel-boss/\">Nvidia chip system</url> for portable electronics is capable of 32 trillion operations a second, up from 1.3 trillion 18 months ago. Better GPUs mean smarter cars that can avoid accidents, medical imaging devices that can detect diseases better than doctors can, and smartphones that take perfect pictures every time.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/05/ces-2017-moores-law-not-dead-says-intel-boss/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - RHS</url>                   Computers learn language                   </p><p>A second related breakthrough is in computers' abilities to grasp the meaning of our language. Chatbots and virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri now do a reasonable job of hearing the words we say, but until recently have done a lousy job of understanding what we mean. The idiosyncrasies of English syntax often make little sense to computers that think in ones and zeros, just as we can understand individual words of a foreign language, but have no idea what is actually being said to us.</p><p>But astounding improvements have been made on that front in 2018. Last year, the gap between computers' and humans' ability to comprehend language more than halved, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/05/ces-2017-moores-law-not-dead-says-intel-boss/\">according to the GLUE benchmark</url>, a sort-of modern Turing test. We may soon be at the point at which computers understand us as well as humans do, if not better.</p><p>That means customer service chatbots and virtual assistants that can actually respond to our commands, and software that can flawlessly translate language.</p><p>                   A tipping point for internet access                   </p><p>In December, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/05/ces-2017-moores-law-not-dead-says-intel-boss/\">51.2pc of the global population was\u00a0online</url>, the first time connectivity has crossed half the world's population. A decade ago, fewer than one in four people were online.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/05/ces-2017-moores-law-not-dead-says-intel-boss/\">Percentage of people using the internet worldwide</url></p><p>This tremendous boom, allowed by cheap smartphones and rising incomes, means greater access to healthcare, government services and business opportunities for billions. Internet connectivity is not an unmitigated benefit: social media has often poured kerosene on existing tensions, and played a big part in atrocities in India and Burma. But on balance, wider internet accessibility has been a huge benefit for the web's new citizens.</p><p>                   Renewable energy                   </p><p>Before last year, it was already more cost effective to build new infrastructure for generating solar or wind energy than to build a new gas or coal plant.</p><p>But last year, it became cheaper in many circumstances to generate energy from renewable sources than from existing fossil fuel plants, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/05/ces-2017-moores-law-not-dead-says-intel-boss/\">according to the investment bank Lazard</url>, which called it an \"inflection point\" for alternative energy.\u00a0</p><p>The cost of generating power from solar, in particular, has plummeted in recent years. The problem now lies with storing energy from such an intermittent source. Today, despite scientists' best efforts, there are few alternatives to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Their cost is falling too, down 85pc since 2010, but further storage breakthroughs may be required.</p><p>                   A new space race                   </p><p>While a lot has been made of Elon Musk's travails at Tesla, his other venture, the rocket company SpaceX, has had a\u00a0breakthrough 12 months, with a record 21 launches, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/05/ces-2017-moores-law-not-dead-says-intel-boss/\">lift-off of its Falcon Heavy rocket</url>, and a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/05/ces-2017-moores-law-not-dead-says-intel-boss/\">Japanese billionaire</url> willing to pay the company to take him to the moon.</p><p>Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin has won contracts with the likes of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/05/ces-2017-moores-law-not-dead-says-intel-boss/\">Boeing and Lockheed Martin</url> .

Not long ago, it was almost universally accepted that innovations would improve society, create enormous economic opportunities and cut down barriers. Now, it seems harder to be optimistic about technology than at any time in recent history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rise of fake news and the use of the internet as a tool to spread division, the threats of mass surveillance and privacy violations, and fears that artificial intelligence will take our jobs, or worse, mean more people are increasingly sceptical of technology-induced change.</p><p>Meanwhile, the giants of Silicon Valley have suffered a market crash, simmering protests and the growing threat of regulation. The conversation around tech in 2018 was about how to rein it in, rather than support it.</p><p>Those stories have been told in these pages as much as elsewhere. But there are others to tell. For all the disasters and crises that the big tech companies went through, there were exceptional developments to celebrate, which could prepare the ground for great benefits in future.</p><p>The first has been a spectacular improvement in graphical processing power in recent months. Tech commentators have made much of the end of Moore's law - the rate that computer processors improve at each year - which until recently had been constant for 50 years.</p><p>Moore's law has been the reason why smartphones are more powerful than the fastest supercomputers of a couple of decades ago, and so its demise could be a serious brake on technological development.</p><p>That might be true were it not for the startling progress in another crucial computing component. The graphics processing unit, or GPU, has become central to modern computing tasks such as image recognition and artificial intelligence. And the processing power of these chips is accelerating dramatically.</p><p>The latest Nvidia chip system for portable electronics is capable of 32 trillion operations a second, up from 1.3 trillion 18 months ago. Better GPUs mean smarter cars that can avoid accidents, medical imaging devices that can detect diseases better than doctors can and smartphones that take perfect pictures every time.</p><p>'We may soon be at the point when computers understand us as well as humans do' A second related breakthrough is in computers' ability to grasp the meaning of our language. Chatbots and virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri now do a reasonable job of hearing the words we say, but until recently have done a lousy job of understanding what we mean.</p><p>The idiosyncrasies of English syntax often make little sense to computers that think in ones and zeros, just as we can understand individual words of a foreign language but have no idea what is actually being said to us.</p><p>But astounding improvements have been made on that front. In terms of comprehension of language, the gap between humans and computers has more than halved, according to the GLUE benchmark, a sort of modern Turing test. We may soon be at the point at which computers understand us as well as humans do, if not better, and that is likely to lead to customer-service chatbots and virtual assistants that can actually respond to our commands, and software that can flawlessly translate language.</p><p>Last year was also a landmark one for internet access. In December, 51pc of the global population was online, the first time connectivity has been enjoyed by over half the world's population. A decade ago, fewer than one in four people were online.</p><p>This tremendous boom, fuelled by cheap smartphones and rising incomes, means greater access to healthcare, government services and business opportunities for billions. Internet connectivity is not an unmitigated benefit: social media has often poured kerosene on existing tensions, and played a big part in atrocities in India and Burma. But on balance, wider internet accessibility has been of huge benefit.</p><p>A fourth development has been the plummeting cost of renewable energy. Before last year, it was already more cost effective to build new infrastructure to generate solar or wind energy than to build a new gas or coal plant. But last year, it became cheaper in many circumstances to generate energy from renewable sources than from existing fossil-fuel plants, according to investment bank Lazard, which called it an \"inflection point\" for alternative energy.</p><p>The cost of generating power from solar, in particular, has plummeted in recent years. The problem now lies with storing energy from such an intermittent source. Today, despite scientists' best efforts, there are few alternatives to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Their cost is falling too, down 85pc since 2010, but further storage breakthroughs may be required.</p><p>Finally, last year saw the emergence of a new space race. While a lot has been made of Elon Musk's travails at Tesla, his other venture, the rocket company SpaceX, has had a breakthrough 12 months, with a record 21 launches, the lift-off of its Falcon Heavy rocket and a Japanese billionaire willing to pay the company to take him to the moon. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has won contracts with the likes of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.</p><p>Even Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic delivered on its long-delayed promise to send people into space. Civilian trips to the moon and beyond remain a long way away, but are perhaps less far-fetched than a year ago.</p><p>'We may soon be at the point when computers understand us as well as humans do'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-145091437</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3M-NHF1-DYTY-C0KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 2, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Google\u2019s parent Alphabet last week became the fourth US company ever to achieve a $1tn market valuation, something that once seemed unthinkable. The search engine joined technology peers Apple, Amazon and Microsoft in crossing the prized market threshold, driven up by investors\u2019 appetite for their shares. </p><p>The broader stock market too has hit a record as valuations responded to the truce between the US and China on trade and surging profits from Wall Street banks. The S&amp;P 500 went over 3,300 for the first time last week. Yet the seemingly relentless march of the markets and the concentrated gains of these tech stocks raise some uncomfortable questions for investors. The tech giants now make up a significant chunk of the market. They account for more than 15 per cent of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s total value, according to Bespoke Investment, and provided one-fifth of the market\u2019s growth in 2019. </p><p>For the wider economy and the market, this is a big deal. The growing dominance of passive funds has only exacerbated this trend; the money flowing into these stocks has forced passives to follow suit as their weighting in the index has increased. Apple, whose market cap of $1.3tn exceeds the total value of stocks on many exchanges, accounted for almost one-tenth of the 29 per cent rise of the S&amp;P 500 last year, according to Bespoke. This level of dominance should give investors pause for thought. </p><p>There are echoes of the \u201cNifty Fifty\u201d era of the 1970s when the market became fixated on a relatively small number of stocks. More recently, the last time there was such a high concentration at the top of the market was during the dotcom bubble 20 years ago. That era saw companies achieve inflated valuations based on little more than hot air, while stocks of average companies were shunned by investors. </p><p>There are crucial differences this time round. Even though the largest stocks today represent a greater share of the S&amp;P\u2019s overall value than their peers did in 2000, their valuations are not as stretched. The fundamentals of today\u2019s $1tn companies are also built on more solid ground. They have strong balance sheets with significant cash-generating capability. Revenue growth rates, too, have kept pace even as these companies have grown bigger. </p><p>But the high growth rates of Big Tech will start to slow as core businesses mature. Calls for stronger privacy and antitrust regulation are growing louder. These are risks that are not easy to price. </p><p>There are uncertainties also for the wider market. Investors have become inured to a world of low interest rates and seem to expect the perfect backdrop of favourable financial conditions and steady growth to continue indefinitely. But the overall macroeconomic climate cannot be ignored. Figures out on Friday showed that China\u2019s economy grew last year at the lowest rate since 1990. Despite the truce in the US-China trade war, the retention of American tariffs could have a further impact on the Chinese economy. Europe\u2019s largest economy faces headwinds, too; German economic growth slowed last year to its lowest rate in six years. The all-important automotive industry is shedding jobs. Some 50,000 job losses were announced last year as the industry grapples with the costs of investing in electric vehicles and pressure from falling sales. </p><p>There is no sign of the rally in the equity markets ending anytime soon. Seasoned market watchers, however, will note that complacency often comes before a correction. Until then, the big are likely only to get bigger.   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-a8dade28392d11eaa6d39a26f8c3cba4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y15-D6J1-JB77-K36V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 19, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Meaningful checks on big tech's healthcare ambitions must follow, says Hal Hodson</p><p>Reboot and reform</p><p>Broader oversight of big tech's healthcare ambitions must follow the flawed DeepMind-NHS deal, says Hal Hodson</p><p>SO THE deal struck over patient data between the Royal Free Foundation NHS Trust and AI pioneer DeepMind \"failed to comply with\" the law. That's &#x2028;the long-awaited verdict of the regulator charged with upholding UK data protection rules.</p><p>The said the trust,  erred in four ways. It did not examine the privacy implications of the agreement closely enough. It failed to tell patients about the deal or offer an opt-out before handing over their records. Plus sharing 1.6 million identifiable records was in excess of that needed to test an app.</p><p>This vindicates New Scientist's story in April 2016, which revealed the true extent of the data transfer and questioned its validity.</p><p>However, there are bigger questions beyond the ICO's remit. Its ruling can't be the , but must herald the start of a much wider discussion about how big tech firms use health data.</p><p>How should  take &#x2028;the value of NHS datasets into account? How do we ensure patients' needs are served by the open standards DeepMind and others are working on, and allow new players into the market? &#x2028;How much control do US parent corporations have over UK-based subsidiaries (DeepMind is owned by Google's parent company)?</p><p>It may seem premature to talk of monopolies and competition when DeepMind's NHS foray is barely a year old, but digital firms can dominate fast. DeepMind is not just building an app for the NHS, it is building infrastructure. If rivals have to interface with that infrastructure, they may find it hard to compete. Hopefully, Interopen, a new health data standards body, will address some of these concerns. </p><p>While it may or may not be &#x2028;a good idea for DeepMind to build, run and control core NHS infrastructure, it would certainly be bad for it to do so with no public debate whatsoever.</p><p>Turning that debate into robust regulation will require something beyond the ICO. Ofcom and Ofgem oversee communication and energy networks in the UK. We may now need Ofdim, the Office of Digital Markets.</p><p>The agglomeration of power and influence online is already taking a toll. The rest of the &#x2028;media industry is suffering, &#x2028;as the bulk of online advertising flows through either Facebook &#x2028;or Google. They also hold disproportionate power when &#x2028;it comes to informing and influencing the public.</p><p>We cannot afford to wait and see if analogous harms arise from digital healthcare platforms. It is &#x2028;a sorry state of affairs when a few big companies effectively control information dissemination in the rich world. Control of healthcare delivery would be worse.</p><p>Hal Hodson is a technology writer based in London.

I believe this is the first legislative hearing ever on the law. The initial passage took place in a frenetic week, too short to notice a hearing; and I don't believe there was a hearing for the technical amendments bill. </p><p>About 100 people attended. Legislator attendance was so-so. Only 3 legislators stayed most of the time; and by the end, only Rep. Chau (the chair) and some staff members remained. Note: I heard there will be a California Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the law on March 5, but I don't have any details. Yes, that would be the same day as the final AG listening session on rule-making at Stanford Law. Video and audio from the hearing[1] is available. This was my first time testifying in a California legislative hearing (I did give remarks at a California legislative event on privacy a few years ago that we held on campus). A few comments on how the process differs from testifying before Congress:the committee members aren't segregated by party. In Congress, seats are strictly divided on party lines, which I feel only reinforces partisanship.I liked California's seating arrangements much better! I wasn't required to submit any written testimony in advance. Nevertheless, I did write up my remarks, and I am sharing them below. Congress runs time management very, very tightly. Usually, every committee member and witness gets 5 minutes each. There is a prominent clock, with color warnings, right in front of each person; and when a person is out of time and the red light goes on, usually the chair waits only a bit before prompting the speaker to wrap up. This also means that committee members expect short, succinct answers to their questions because every witness answer eats into their 5 minutes In contrast, there was no time management function visible at all in the Assembly hearing. Most witnesses were quite respectful of the committee's time anyway, and the chair prompted a speaker to wrap up only once. The relaxed time management made the entire hearing feel a little more relaxed.This post recaps what I heard at the event, with some of my commentary, usually indicated as my comments. As usual, most of the recap is not verbatim what the speaker actually said; it's my impression of what I heard. If you want to confirm any speaker's remarks, please refer to the tapes. After the recap, I've included the prepared written remarks from some of the speakers. These are also not verbatim because most speakers deviate, at least slightly, from the prepared remarks, but they may be useful references nonetheless. (As usual with CCPA posts, I've included the dumpster fire visual metaphor. This is my view and no one else's). ___ Opening Remarks Rep. Chau (chair): He extolled the law's virtues. He explained the animating goals: your data, your privacy, your choice. He said it is clear that the legislature's work is not done. He cautioned against prejudging requests from 'business' and 'tech.' He wants stakeholders to find consensus where possible. He doesn't want to erode the law's rights in the name of cleanup or clarity. Instead, he wants surgical, precise changes that don't roll back protections. [Eric's general note: this law is a great example of the endowment effect. Now that the law is on the books, any change-even what seem to me to be obvious and non-controversial cleanup changes-is treated as a denigration of consumer rights. Thus, virtually every change that doesn't expand the bill will have a price tag associated with it, even in situations where everyone knew before the bill's passage that changes would be needed. It's a fascinating case study of human psychology as applied to legislative drafting.] Rep. Obernolte: The law passed on an abbreviated timeframe, and everyone knew it needs substantial cleanup. He thinks it will take years to claw our way through the cleanup. [Eric's comment: I liked his remarks the best. Note he's a former software programmer.] ___ First Panel Alastair MacTaggart: He gave his standard dog-and-pony show, which is a slick mix of lucid and cogent analysis and atextual fantasy. As usual, he focused almost exclusively on the law's impact on Internet giants, not small offline retail operations. For example, he claimed the law should only cover large companies, not mom-and-pop businesses, even though the law reaches millions of mom-and-pop operations. He thinks web browsers will adopt 'do not sell' extensions that will automate opt-outs of data sales. Veronica Abreu, Square: She raised concerns about the law's reach to small businesses and its deleterious effects on fraud prevention. She endorsed the GDPR's definition of 'personal information' and noted that the GDPR authorizes some data uses irrespective of consumer consent. She expressed concerns about the challenges of authenticating access/deletion/porting requests, especially via the 1-800 phone number all covered businesses must have. Tanya Forsheit,Frankfurt Kurnit Klein ...lz: See her remarks below. She compared the long windup to the GDPR with the short ramp for the CCPA. She also explained the expense and complexity of getting ready for GDPR compliance. Comment from Rep. Gallagher: He think there may be issues that need to be clarified, but he wants to guard against undermining substantive rights. He thinks it's a stretch to worry about undermining fraudsters because businesses know more than customers expect. He thinks it's unfair that data is less regulated than the farm industry. Q from Rep. Wicks: she asked MacTaggart if he preferred an opt-in for data sales. MacTaggart explained that, based on the advice of Berkeley Prof. Chris Hoofnagle, they chose opt-out to avoid the IMS v. Sorrell case and the risk of constitutional problems. He thinks the browser extension will get where he wants to go anyway. Q from Rep. Irwin about the data breach private right of action. MacTaggart answered that encryption is off-the-shelf technology. [Eric's comment: it's flip to say that encryption is off-the-shelf technology. Putting aside that this is another increased cost of doing business, properly deploying an encryption program is well beyond the technological expertise of many small and even medium sized businesses. Irrespective of whether businesses comply with the technical letter of the law, online security is a process-a demanding, time-consuming, relentless, expensive, and often ultimately doomed process.] Q from Rep. Irwin about the percent of businesses that were/are GDPR compliant. Forsheit responded that there may be no such thing as 100% GDPR compliance because it's an ongoing process. She emphasized that fake data subject requests are a thing. Q from Rep. Irwin about GDPR enforcement in the US. Forsheit explained that she expected US businesses without an EU establishment to fight any enforcement efforts. Still, the EU claims it has jurisdiction. Q from Rep. Irwin to Abreu about whether Square is GDPR-compliant. Abreu said that some of Square's products aren't offered in the EU. Otherwise, yes, and Square is trying to help its customers comply too. She said she doesn't want to reduce the CCPA's consumer rights, but they do provide a security attack vector without any hacking required. Q from Rep. Irwin about the 50,000 consumer/devices standard for 'businesses' regulated by the law. Abreu said 50,000 IP addresses reaches small businesses. Rep. Irwin then invited a response from MacTaggart. He said the AG's office will issue regs on the steps required to authenticate access/deletion/porting requests, but he thinks that there will not be enough data to verify a person based on their IP address. [Eric's comment: this is a crucial point, and I don't think MacTaggart's guess about what the AG rule might say should provide us much comfort.] He reminded everyone that the initiative's definition of 'business' was 100,000 consumers/year [and, I'll note, $50M in revenue], and it was the legislature that reduced the numbers. [Eric's comment: I don't know how or why those numbers changed in the backroom negotiations, but that was a terrible mistake that should be fixed.] Q from Rep. Berman: The law's passage was rushed and the legislature didn't understand all of the law's implications. He wants to address the overly onerous provisions to businesses, such as the requirement that businesses have a 1-800 phone number. MacTaggart explained that the 1-800 number requirement helps provide access to lower-income people who may not have computer access. ___ Second Panel Stacey Schesser, AG's office. Multiple times, she asked the legislature for more money, even though the office will keep 100% of the fines it generates. The AG's office really, really does not want to issue individualized advisory guidance to companies. She also warned that legislative changes may further slow down the AG's rule-making. The AG's office is calling the 30 day cure period a 'get out of jail free' card, and the AG's office doesn't want to be in the business of giving out 'fix it' tickets. [Eric's comment: I felt these remarks were pretty condescending. Most compliance obligations cannot be satisfied in 30 days, so any sensible business will not deliberately violate the law and just wait for the AG's call because there won't be enough remaining time to fix any serious problem. Furthermore, most legit businesses will be striving mightily to do the right thing even though they have no fucking clue what to do and currently no guidance from the AG about how to do it. Finally, there are so many detailed obligations that it's inevitable that many well-meaning businesses will have minor compliance violations that are indeed best handled by, you guessed it, fix-it tickets.] She also reiterated that the AG favors opening up the entire law to a private right of action. The most important takeaway: she said the office is shooting to meet its June 30, 2020 deadline for completing rule-making. [Eric's comment: That means the AG's office has no intent to issue final rules before Jan. 1, 2020 (not that there was ever a realistic chance), so the AG's enforcement authority will kick in July 1, 2020. It also seems guaranteed that final rules will be available only a few months or weeks before the July 1, 2020 enforcement commencement, so businesses will have a lot of expensive scrambling to do to accommodate the final rules. Bummer. Given this, the legislature should slip the July 1, 2020 enforcement commencement; if not, I hope the AG's office will announce its own enforcement delays to give businesses adequate time to adjust to the final rules.] Q from Rep. Chau: he cited another area of the law where the AG's office issues advisory opinions. Qs from Rep. Irwin about local enforcement (no) and the possibility of issuing written guidance. ___ Third Panel Sarah Boot, CalChamber: The AG's office needs adequate resources, but the goal should be compliance, not enforcement. Businesses need the opportunity to cure-we should view it as part of their education. A private right of action would be frightening; see the bad PAGA lawsuits. CCPA is a hard law to comply with. The majority of affected businesses are not tech giants. The news coverage emphasizes the law's application to big tech. The reality is that this law reaches small businesses but the law treats them the same as the tech giants.We should set businesses up for success. Prof. Eric Goldman, Santa Clara University School of Law: see my remarks below. I explained some problems with the definition of 'personal information.' Kevin McKinley, Internet Association: see his remarks below. He discussed the overbroad definition of 'sell.' He mentioned how the law interferes with ad-based businesses and hinders the aggregation of niche audiences. Tanya Forsheit: see her remarks below. She discussed the definition of 'consumer,' especially how it reaches employees and business contacts. She also discussed the current private right of action for data security breaches, which will be inevitable because every business has, or will have, data breaches. The high statutory damages have a diminishing marginal return on deterrence. Margaret Gladstein, California Retailers Association: see her remarks below. She discussed the application of the non-discrimination provisions on loyalty programs. The restrictions on data sales may hinder cross-promotions with other companies. Sarah Boot: she discussed how the restrictions on data sales could hinder government entities' ability to do things like fraud prevention or law enforcement. Alastair MacTaggart responded to some of the remarks. He cited the increasing ability of companies to associate data. [Eric's comment: this is something he and I actually agree on. We disagree about the policy implications. The law was not properly designed to treat every scrap of data as personal information. It makes the disclosure, access, deletion, and portability rights all impossible.] He also made a number of mixed truth/atextual statements about what the law does or doesn't do. Elizabeth Galicia, Common Sense: Her main points seemed to ask why should Californians have less rights than Europeans? [Eric's comment: it's a nice soundbite, but it completely obscures massive divergences in California and European legal foundations and approaches to regulation (including, of course, our Constitution), cultural norms, economic drivers, and historical experiences. But other than that, we're almost the same.] ___ Fourth Panel Nicole Ozer, ACLU: She waxed poetic about the California Constitution's protection for privacy. She brought up Cambridge Analytica a lot, even though the law applies to millions of businesses that have nothing in common with Cambridge Analytica. She wants more granular disclosures about who receives a company's shared data. She also wants more consumer control over data sharing, opt-in, stronger anti-discrimination provisions, and a private right of action. Lee Tien, EFF: He said rights don't protect themselves. He expressed confusion about all of the love for the GDPR, when it also hammers ad-supported businesses. [Eric's comments: I share the skepticism over the new-found love for the GDPR, but if California is going to impose privacy protections that deviate from the GDPR and impose the associated duplicative compliance costs, the new CA approach should be that much better to justify the extra compliance costs]. He expressed concerns about the lack of a private right of action: he cited how the federal government shutdown hinder the FTC's investigation of Facebook, he's worried about regulatory capture, and he likes the GDPR's decentralized enforcement. [Eric's comment: this last point is confusing. If other states enact their own privacy laws that mimic CCPA, that will unleash many other state prosecutors onto the privacy beat, which will then look a lot like the GDPR's decentralized enforcement. So it does not make sense to consider California's privacy enforcement in isolation.] Todd Weaver, Purism: he did a sales pitch for his company's product. [Eric's comments: along the way, he said several ridiculous things, including that the GDPR didn't put people out of business-a statement that I'm sure will be disproven by forthcoming empirical papers, including one draft I've seen-and the CCPA is easy to comply with, which instantly eliminated any remaining credibility he had.] Prof. Scott Jordan, UC Irvine Computer Science Department: he was the only speaker that went so long that Rep. Chau asked him to wrap up. He talked about the differences between data uses that are consistent with users' expectations in context and new data uses that would surprise users. [Eric's comment: he lost a lot of credibility with me when he praised the statutory definition of deidentified information, which is garbage.] Ashkan Soltani: He talked about how data brokerage is scary. [Eric's comment: He said the CCPA isn't that complicated, so I guess I'd love to know what it takes for a law to be complicated to him. From my perspective, a 10,000 word law that cuts across 40M people and millions of businesses is per se complicated.] Sarah Boot: The law reaches businesses with low profit margins. How much will the law raise consumer prices? A private right of action would be devastating. She reminded the legislature that tech giants are a trivial fraction of the affected businesses. Tanya Forsheit: She noted the panoply of existing laws that already protect California consumers. Ashkan Soltani: he said that it would be rare for any offline business to meet the definition of 'business' without having an online presence. [Eric's comment: needs citation. This statement is unenlightening because most businesses have some online presence, but many tiny businesses like high-volume retailers will cross the statutory threshold without counting their online presence at all. If you add the numbers from their online presence, then that just expands the law's reach further.] He also said that cloud services will provide compliance tools. [Eric's comment: again, needs a citation, and again, this assumes the problem is exclusively with online data.] ___ Public Comments I counted 15 audience members who spoke. Only 1, from Consumer Reports, wanted an expansion of the law. The other 14 included representatives from the Association for National Advertisers (ANA), Allclear, California school adminstrators, Nonprofit Alliance, national payroll companies, the California News Publisher Association, the securities industry, the California Latino Chamber of Commerce, a small business association, Technet, the Consumer Data Association, the CTIA, and the Employment Council. Some of the more interesting points:California school administrators are concerned that the law overrides the existing privacy rules. Nonprofits are excluded from the law, but the law impacts them anyway because it will starve them of data. The speaker claimed that nonprofits will be the canaries in the coalmine for the law's deleterious effects. The California Latino Chamber of Commerce is worried that the law will limit or eliminate free online services that help new businesses get started cheaply, and this will disproportionately hurt their members.____ [Written Remarks:I'm sharing the prepared written remarks that I was able to get.] California State Assembly Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection Informational Hearing: Understanding the Rights, Protections, and Obligations Established by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018: Where should California go from here? Testimony of Tanya Forsheit, Partner and Chair, Privacy ...ta Security Group, Frankfurt Kurnit Klein ...lz Panel One February 20, 2019 Mr. Chair and Members, thank you for the opportunity to testify here today. My name is Tanya Forsheit. I am a partner with the law firm Frankfurt Kurnit Klein ...lz, Chair of the Firm's Privacy ...ta Security Group, and I am based in the Los Angeles office. I am also an adjunct professor at Loyola Law School. I have been practicing law in California since 1997 and I have been practicing privacy and data security law since 2006. I am certified by the International Association of Privacy Professionals as a CIPP/US and a CIPT. I am here today in my capacity as a privacy lawyer who has represented hundreds of businesses in such matters. I am not here representing any particular client. I am here on this panel to provide you with some background on the burdens and challenges companies face in complying with or attempting to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'). The GDPR has extraterritorial application under Article 3, so companies doing business in California that offer goods or services to individuals located in the EU are already required to implement very significant compliance measures to protect consumer privacy. These include: data mapping (which cannot be fully automated, and requires discussions with each business unit and IT); amending contracts with all service providers (which requires legal advice); updating privacy policies (which also requires legal counsel); setting up and maintaining mechanisms for consumers to make requests for access, portability, and deletion, and to exercise other rights; and training personnel. If done correctly, this requires significant investment in technology and personnel resources, including either new hires or diverting existing personnel away from their regular jobs. Businesses in California have already spent anywhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars getting ready for GDPR and complying since it took effect on May 25, 2018. According to CSO magazine, 88% of companies spent more than $1 million on preparing for the GDPR. The GDPR does not have a private right of action with statutory damages. It can be enforced by EU regulators (data protection authorities) or in representative actions (for example, brought by an advocacy group). But there is no class action available in Europe and nothing like statutory damages available without any showing of harm. The GDPR became law in April 2016 and companies had two years to prepare before enforcement began on May 25, 2018. Despite that longer runway under the GDPR and these considerable investments in time and expense, many if not most US companies are still not in compliance because the undertaking is so significant. According to a Capgemini survey released one week before the law took effect in May 2018, 85 percent of firms in Europe and the United States were not ready to fully comply on time and one in four would not be fully compliant by the end of 2018. The CCPA is even more complex and challenging for reasons that you will hear described today. For example, even the inclusion of the word household in the definition of personal information, which is not part of the GDPR, changes the entire scope of compliance. As a consequence, despite having done significant work on GDPR, companies doing business in California are not ready for CCPA. As currently drafted, many businesses will have to reinvent their compliance programs for CCPA, with an even shorter timeline for implementation. The CCPA became law on June 28, was already amended once on September 23, and will take effect on January 1, 2020. Experience with the GDPR has demonstrated that we are going to need some changes to the CCPA, and to this timeline, for compliance to be realistic. Thank you. ___ Assembly Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee Hearing on the California Consumer Privacy Act Testimony of Prof. Eric Goldman, Santa Clara University School of Law February 20, 2019 Mr. Chair and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak at this hearing. I am a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, where I co-direct the school's High Tech Law Institute and its Privacy Law Certificate. I have been teaching and writing about Internet Law for a quarter-century. My remarks address the definition of 'personal information.' This definition is a critical piece of the law because it distinguishes regulated from unregulated information. An over-broad definition of 'personal information' creates problems throughout the entire law, which is the case now. The definition of 'personal information' includes 'information that.is [reasonably] capable of being associated witha particular consumer or household,' with about a dozen different examples of what that might include. Personal information isn't limited to sensitive or obviously identifiable information, such name, phone number, or social security number. It sweeps in any scrap of data that has the theoretical *capability* of being associated with a consumer. Unfortunately, the definition of personal information creates many problems. I'll highlight four:First, effectively any information related to consumers counts as personal information, no matter what steps the business takes to avoid that. The law excludes some consumer data from the definition of personal information, but the exclusions do not work. The reason why is that computer scientists increasingly can find ways to associate innocuous bits of data with individual consumers. As a result, virtually every piece of data from or about consumers technically meets the statutory requirement of being reasonably capable of being attributed to a particular consumer or household. So, despite the law's clear intent otherwise, the law treats all data in a business' possession as personal information and subject to the law's strict regulation. Most of the law's obligations\u2014ranging from portability to disclosures to deletion\u2014become impossible to administer when all information is personal information. Second, the law creates an untenable situation when a consumer's personal information resides in multiple databases and a consumer takes advantage of his/her statutory right to access or delete his/her personal information. Here's an example of how that might arise: an online retailer allows consumers to create a personal profile, while it maintains a separate database to customize special deals to a person's IP address. Assume a consumer asks the retailer to delete all of his/her personal information. It may be easy to delete the consumer's profile, but how will the retailer delete the consumer's IP address and associated data in the separate offers database? The law seemingly requires the retailer to determine the consumer's IP address (if possible\u2014many IP addresses are shared, like on wi-fi at a retailer), determine it belonged to the consumer, and then delete it. This request becomes even more unrealistic with offline data\u2014say, security camera footage of the consumer shopping in the store, or a salesperson's notes of their interactions with the consumer. The law says linking across databases isn't required [1798.145(i)], but this only applies to data that isn't maintained as 'personal information.' As I just mentioned, virtually all consumer data meets the broad definition of personal information, so this exclusion does not help. Instead, the law may counterproductively encourage online services to digitize more data and proactively link databases to make future access/deletion requests easier. Third, the definition of personal information excludes some government-published data, but even that data is not freely usable. Broadly restricting the flow of government-published information is almost certainly unconstitutional. Fourth, as Sarah discussed, the definition of 'household' means that a person can see and affect the information of other people. This is the opposite of 'personal.'The CCPA's definition of 'personal information' reaches beyond the analogous GDPR definition. The GDPR defines 'personal data' as 'any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.' I have numerous reservations about the GDPR, but this is an area where the California legislature could benefit from adopting the GDPR's approach. The GDPR definition isn't perfect, but it would solve some of the problems I've identified today. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. ___ Assembly Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee Hearing February 20, 2019 'Understanding the Rights, Protections, and Obligations Established by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018: Where should California go from here?' Testimony of Kevin McKinley, Internet Association Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak today. My name is Kevin McKinley, and I am the Director of California Government Affairs for Internet Association, which represents over 45 leading internet companies many of which are headquartered here in California. Internet Association members support the spirit of CCPA to provide people with meaningful transparency and control over their data, including the ability to, control, access, delete, and move it. In granting these rights, CCPA redefined some commonly understood concepts. One example is the concept of 'sell.' We understand the will of the Legislature was to make sure consumers know when, how, and to whom their information is sold. This is something internet companies also support. However, in redefining 'sell' we believe that CCPA unintentionally jeopardizes the privacy protective practices used in online advertising. I'll talk briefly about how online ads work, why we're concerned with the new definition, and how the Legislature can fix it. Online advertising was designed with privacy in mind. Instead of carrying personally identifiable information around the web, online advertising uses identifiers that are not directly tied to individuals. Advertisers do not need to know who you are\u2014your name, address, or other personally identifiable information\u2014in order to show you an ad online. But they do need basic data to cross the web in order to do so. Clicking on a web page sends information that is needed for the web page to populate. A web page may draw from numerous sources - one database showing the latest news, another showing a photo, another showing stock prices, still another showing advertisements which help support and pay for the content the user views on the web page. More specifically, clicking on a page sends the IP address, time and date stamp, browser type or mobile operating system type, some additional technical information about the actual device being used to format the content properly, and any cookie information. These all direct which content will populate the page, including which ad best fits. We do not believe these bits of non identifiable technical information, which are basic mechanics of the internet, were intended to be covered by CCPA's definition of sell. In common understanding, this information is neither personal nor is it being sold in this process. Treating this as a sale of personal information jeopardizes the underpinnings of the internet. In addition to the common sense nature of not considering these data flows as sales, I want to spend a moment on what it would mean if they were considered sales. Many of the internet services we rely on everyday are supported by ad revenue. This model also empowers creators and allows them to support themselves through their content. Also, small publishers that make a living by writing their own blogs on everything from cooking and gardening to covering community news are generally supported by online advertising. Large publishers and content providers also rely on ad revenue to support theirbusiness. Further, many small brick and mortar businesses have been able to to find their niche audiences efficiently through advertising online. Together, this model is foundational to the internet sector and critical for California to preserve. Mischaracterizing advertising as a sale of data would confuse those concerned about real sales of their actual personal data - data that is tied to their name and identity. If the advertising data flow were put in the same basket as actual sales of personal information, an opt-out of sales would end revenue for the services, publishers, and limit the ability of businesses to find their customers. It would endanger a business model fundamental to the internet without any privacy benefit. Again, we do not believe\u2014and the co-sponsors have confirmed\u2014that it was not the goal of CCPA to jeopardize this practice. However, the statute is unclear at the moment. In order to capture the intent of CCPA and to protect this important business model, we will be asking foran amendment to make clear that this practice is not considered a sale under the Act. We look forward to working with the Legislature on this solution. ___ Assembly Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee Hearing February 20, 2019 'Understanding the Rights, Protections, and Obligations Established by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018: Where should California go from here?' Testimony of Margaret Gladstein, Capitol Advocacy on behalf of the California Retailers Association Mr. Chair and members, thank you for the opportunity to present today. My name is Margaret Gladstein. I'm here on behalf of the California Retailers Association. I concur with the testimony by my fellow panelists and want to emphasize that CRA is deeply concerned with the liability in CCPA. CRA is also concerned that Section 1798.125 - known as the non-discrimination section - raises doubts about the legality of loyalty and rewards programs. We appreciate that Mr. McTaggart and some consumer groups believe these programs can continue. But we are uncertain about the clarity of the law. What IS clear is that consumers embrace these programs. 80% of Americans belong to at least one, and the most popular are supermarket and drugstore programs. CRA's members offer rewards programs because we want to encourage customer loyalty. Just as you use data about individual voters to help earn a vote, we use data to help earn our customer's business. The law currently says a business CANNOT discriminate against a consumer for exercising their rights under the CCPA by: (A) Denying goods or services to the consumer. (B) Charging different prices or rates, including through the use of discounts or other benefits. (C) Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer. The same section goes on to say: 'A business MAY offer financial incentives, including payments to consumers as compensation for the collection, sale or deletion of personal information. A business may also offer a different price, rate, level, or quality of goods or services to the consumer if that price or difference is directly related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer's data.' Confusing? I would say so. I appreciate the hard work and countless hours that went into drafting this law, but this section and its interplay with other parts of the law leaves retailers, grocers, hotels and airlines questioning what we can and cannot do with our rewards programs. While I understand the legislative intent is that we can continue to offer them - and CRA's members want to do so without running afoul of the law - ultimately, unless this section is clarified, neither this Committee nor any other legislative body will determine the meaning of these words. Instead, it will be up to the courts to reconcile the various sections of the law that could bear on these programs. That's the uncertainty we want to end - before it ends loyalty programs. Perhaps many of you are thinking: are loyalty programs selling my data? CRA's members are not in the business of selling data. We want to sell goods and services. But some of the most popular parts of our members' loyalty programs could potentially be considered a sale under the sweeping definition in CCPA. For example, Safeway Club Card members can earn discounts at Chevron. JCPenney's rewards members can use their points for purchases at Sephora in JCPenney. We simply want to continue to offer benefits like these to consumers. We look forward to working with you to protect these programs while protecting the framework of CCPA. ___ California State Assembly Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection Informational Hearing: Understanding the Rights, Protections, and Obligations Established by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018: Where should California go from here? Testimony of Tanya Forsheit, Partner and Chair, Privacy ...ta Security Group, Frankfurt Kurnit Klein ...lz Panel Three February 20, 2019 Good morning, again, Mr. Chair and Members. For my time on this panel, I will discuss the concerns raised by the current definition of consumer in the CCPA, and overreach of the private right of action in its current form. The definition of consumer is any California resident. Thus, a 'consumer' need not have a customer relationship with a business in order to exercise their rights under the CCPA. Without clarification, this could be interpreted to include employees and present a number of concerns. Keeping in mind that the CCPA applies to any business that collects even 137 unique credit cards or IP addresses a day, the operational costs for small businesses of including employees (past and current), job applicants, and other related individuals who do not have a true 'consumer' relationship with the business will be exorbitant. For example, a small family-owned restaurant that serves 150 tables a day will also have to operationalize CCPA for its kitchen and wait staff in a business with high turnover. Access to personal information in the employment context is already established in California law. But the CCPA would allow a separated spouse who is part of a household to gain access to payroll records. That cannot be what the legislature intended. The definition of consumer is also problematic in that it currently encompasses business representatives in the context of business to business interactions. The opportunity to delete or opt-out of the disclosure of business data in a business to business transaction could result in fraud and make it impossible to comply with third party due diligence requirements. Imagine also what this means for, as just one example, a small medical practice that already complies with HIPAA for patient data, but that will now be required to honor opt out and deletion requests from suppliers with whom they email for business purposes but who never have access to patient data. In Washington State, Senate Bill 5376 explicitly excludes employees or contractors of a business acting in their roles as employees or contractors from the definition of consumer in Section 3. California should do the same. I will now turn to the private right of action. The CCPA allows a consumer to seek statutory damages ranging from $100 to $750 per person, per incident without any demonstration of harm if that consumer's personal information is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the business's violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices. As we understand it, the CCPA was meant to exclude encrypted data as well as redacted data from this private right of action - but the current language does not do so. What do we know about data breaches? We know that every business has either had a data security breach or will have one even if they have implemented reasonable security procedures and practices. It is the nature of the world we live in today. The Ponemon Institute and Balbix just issued the results of a global survey of 600+ cybersecurity leaders and professionals showing that 67% of organizations are not confident that they can avoid a data breach. One of the most pervasive threats to companies is phishing attacks, which have become increasingly sophisticated. Even if an organization encrypts all of its personal information, that will be no shield to sophisticated phishing attacks, which appear to be legitimate business requests. Let's go back to the small family-owned restaurant. The restaurant's night manager discovers that his email has been compromised through a phishing scam that appeared to come from his outsourced IT guy and asked him to enter his credentials. Now he also suspects that the bad guys probably had access to personal information of restaurant customers, such as credit card numbers. California law already says the restaurant must notify those affected individuals. Under the CCPA, each of those affected individuals can sue the restaurant for $100-$750 per incident, or bring a class action on behalf of same. You can see how the situation quickly spirals out of control. If that small family-owned restaurant serves even just 1,000 unique customers per week who pay by credit card, or slightly more than 50,000 unique credit card customers per year, the damages attributable to the class for that restaurant alone would range between $5,000,000 and $37,500,000. Even the low end of that range, plus attorneys' fees, would be enough to bankrupt any small business. Faced with that potential liability, these business owners will be forced to enter into immediate settlement - even if they think they have a strong defense based on reasonable security - because the cost of litigation is so high. The net result is that the trial attorneys win but consumers won't be any more protected than they are today. As noted already, it is if, not when, a company will experience a breach. And the attacks are becoming even more sophisticated, with organized crime and nation states in the game. California businesses are the victims but are punished by this law. This is a sledgehammer, not a stick, and there comes a point where deterrence has diminishing returns. Even one of the nation's leading plaintiffs' lawyers in the privacy space, Jay Edelson, thinks that $750 is way too much money, as he noted in an August 10, 2018 episode of the Privacy Advisor podcast. You have the opportunity to make this legislation even more protective of consumers (as opposed to their lawyers) and less damaging to the California economy by creating a safe harbor to this onerous liability or by simply removing the minimum amount of statutory damages. Thank you for your time and consideration. ___ Related Posts *A Status Report on the California Consumer Privacy Act[2] *41 California Privacy Experts Urge Major Changes to the California Consumer

The roundtable was intended to update the study's record from 2017, when progress stalled on the report. Thus, the topic nominally was to discuss how the law, especially the caselaw, had changed in the intervening years. In fact, 512 caselaw has noticeably slowed down since 2017, so there are only a handful of cases to discuss, and they reached messy results. Some cases since Jan. </p><p>1, 2017: Cox[1], Grande[2], Motherless[3], Mavrix v. LJ (we never blogged it), Zazzle[4]. The 512 haters were aglow about the EU Copyright Directive, and predictably they favored extending it to the US; and several were unrestrained in saying that they disliked Section 512's structural burden-sharing approach. I'm including my notes from the day below. As usual, these are my impressions, not verbatim transcriptions of the remarks. In many cases, I didn't use the exact words of the participants. Please don't rely on my summaries as authoritative characterizations of what was said. A recording and transcript will be available from the Copyright Office, so I encourage you to consult those. I've added limited editorial comments in brackets. Rebecca Tushnet did a more faithful transcription and also added more editorial comments. See her recaps: Structurally, the roundtable gave each panel participant up to 45 seconds to make introductory remarks, followed by Qs from the Copyright Office representatives. 45 seconds was a ridiculously small time, but most speakers tried not to abuse it. * * * Karyn Temple: In past roundtables, it was a tale of two cities on whether the DMCA is working well or not.

There is a cottage industry of enforcement services, but platforms have grown to let people express themselves. 512 strikes the right balance. In contrast, Article 13 undermines creativity. We should export 512 around the world. Pariser: Cox and Grande are right on the repeat infringer issue but those results are obvious. Motherless is mixed bag. The MPAA disagrees that any kind of repeat infringer policy works. Saying that there isn't a need to track takedown notices doesn't make sense. Tushnet: Motherless is a one-person operation. Don't treat it like YouTube. Willen: we should consider the nature of the site in determining its obligations. Smith: is there a minimum standard? Willen: courts have focused on strikes. In Cox, the consequences of termination were different than termination by web host. Also, we should think about ways to educate users who don't know the rules. Smith: should the burden be on copyright owners? Carey: no Smith: have cases changed that at all? Carey: if Cox's practice didn't violate, what would? Greenberg: has pendulum swung? Carey: we don't think the balance is right yet. Hatfield: unreasonable to apply standards from small services to giants. For music, they should filter by ISRC code. Sending takedown notice costs $1,500+; litigation is even more. Musicians make most money in first 18 months of work, but lawsuits don't resolve during that time period. 512 helps drag cases out. If you profit from my work, share the money with me. Rose: 512 applies to broadband and web hosts, but the stakes are different. Amer: In a prior roundtable, IAPs said they rejected takedown notices. Cox changes that. Have practices changed? Carey: practices have changed, and ongoing litigation on this front. Isbell: are IAP terminations due to 512 repeat infringer policy 'state action'? Rose: no, but it's equivalent to state action. Greenberg: what about voluntary measures? Rose: there are gradations. Tushnet: can't say it's just private action Pariser: termination should only be in appropriate circumstances, so this can encompass the nature of strikes and the different types of services. But services need actual policies, not made-up policies. Repeat infringer obligation doesn't implicate the First Amendment. Termination from one IAP may not prevent any access to Internet except in rare areas. Smith: what about Mavrix? Shemmeri: they profited, so they should have paid. Willen: when do sites curate? LJ ruling implied pre-review ended 512. Motherless made it clear that pre-review is OK. Also, we know from 230 that Congress wanted services to remove and filter, especially remove sexually explicit content off the site. We can't negate 512(c) if services do that. Amer: is curation permissible? Willen: YouTube's suggested videos are a form of curation that don't eliminate 512. Every service does curation. It doesn't make sense to penalize curation. The consequence would be junky sites. Amer: It's an administrable rule that direct infringement applies when sites 'choose' content. Willen: In LJ, submissions were pre-reviewed, and the service decided which to publish. If doing that level of ex ante selection of publications puts 512 at risk, that puts pressure on 512. But YouTube/UGC sites let people post what they want, then make those submissions more organized and available. Troubling to risk 512 when services police terrorism. Isbell: IP is carved out from 230. Does that indicate IP should be different? Willen: 230 says online services have right to, and are encouraged to, police objectionable content. Smith: what about encouraging content? Willen: can't think of a case where a service made decisions about good/bad content and that negates 512. That policy would be inconsistent with Congress' goals for 230 and not good public policy. What kind of Internet do we want? Pariser: she objected to the notion that moderator curating content implies no safe harbor is bad for content. No one is curating for copyright. Services are picking content they like/don't like for their own reasons, not based on infringement (until takedown notice is sent). If an online service demonstrates that they pick-and-choose files, they should have obligation to do that for infringement as well. This doesn't matter if it's done pre- or post-upload\u2014whenever they make choices, they need to accept responsibility for infringing content. They should adopt filters, which aren't expensive. Amer: any distinction between Motherless (high level monitoring) and more curated service? Pariser: there is a continuum of curation. Amer: did Motherless get it right that screening bad content doesn't disqualify for 512? In contrast to LJ, which made choices of what to publish. Pariser: Motherless makes sense in light of current jurisprudence. However, courts are misinterpreting 512. It should always be the case that if a site can control the content on their site, they should be filtering for infringement. Greenberg: if a site filters for anything, does that mean they are always liable? Pariser: editing content demonstrates the service's ability to filter. Lemon: content moderation is a difficult subject. Most content moderation is driven by user flags, which is similar to DMCA (copyright owners must flag). It's problematic if efforts to moderate content require perfect filtering. Smith: what about the Zazzle ruling? Is that case just about physical product? Lemon: different issue when service markets physical product Smith: is that different from generating eyeballs for ads? Lemon: services often rely on automated processes. Even human reviewers make mistakes. Consider the scale. Reddit in 2016-18 saw 700% increase in takedown notices received. It's unrealistic to expect services to make investments that match YouTube Content ID. Greenberg: we've heard that 512 isn't one-size-fits-all. Would it make sense to impose the obligations once services reach a certain size? Lemon: Internet companies ramp up really quickly. Winterton: filters aren't inexpensive. Hatfield: how can we monetize music? How hard is it to register ISRC codes? Smith: what are standard technical measures? Carey: we can't send representative list, and there is no more red flags. Must send URL-by-URL list. Osterreicher: their group encourages photographers to watermark. Services should be able to recognize and screen for watermarks. Smith: are standards developing for CMI? Osterreicher: technology is improving to merge information about the image owner with the image, which will confer knowledge to everyone else. Greenberg: how would a service know who uploaded the image and with what rights? Osterreicher: That's a problem. Start by recognizing watermark, then figure it out. Tushnet: ability to hash child porn isn't the same in other content types. YouTube is filtering as well as anyone, yet everyone still complains. OTW terminate users for a variety of reasons, but it only gets 10/yr DMCA takedown notices. Doesn't make sense to impose liability on services for having a TOS. Amer: does a watermark trigger red flag knowledge? Tushnet: OTW doesn't filter. We don't want to go to war against our users. Amer: What constitutes red flags knowledge? Tushnet: people make mistakes, and people are busybodies who pretend to be the copyright owner. Amer: what's difference between actual notice and red flags knowledge? Does red flags knowledge have any meaning? Tushnet: impossible to say in the abstract. Maybe stolencelebritypix.com? Lemon: can't solve the red flags problem. YouTube sees 300 hours of video every minute. Instagram gets 100M photos/day. Smith: if you have a filtering database, what are best practices? Lemon: lots of collaboration between platforms and rightsholders, especially as platforms become rightsholders themselves. Ex: Facebook getting license deals from publishers. The interests are aligning in spectacular ways. There are monthly phone calls to figure out best practices. IA members want to have best experience for users, which is usually professional content. Concerned that going above the statute shouldn't establish new legal baseline. Osterreicher: wants watermarks to flag work for additional investigation. Maybe revenue share programs can include photographers. Turek: Content ID isn't state of the art. Willen: red flag is difference between objective (actual knowledge) and subjective knowledge. Smith: what is red flags knowledge? Willen: every court has come to conclusion that it's narrow for good reason. Figuring out copyright infringement is hard and requires context. Watermarking photo doesn't tell you much. Every photo on Internet is owned by someone. Now what? Amer: it's hard to think of an example of red flag knowledge. File title isn't enough. Willen: in YouTube, file titles that signaled infringement were actually posted by copyright owner as marketing. Maybe red flag would apply when full-length video uploaded pre-release. Otherwise, all files are likely copyrighted, and there is a huge volume. Isbell: do ISPs use their own service? Ex: it's easy to find YouTube videos with just music and lyrics. Ex: Pinterest bookmarks by taking images. Willen: on YouTube, much of that is licensed. Re Pinterest thumbnails, fair use plays a role. Pariser: content owners feel like the goalposts keep moving. They can't send catalog of works to create red flags knowledge. Shemmeri: copyright notices are stripped from digital files, so that undermines red flags. Tushnet: don't presume what services are meant to do. There are 6-7 different YouTubes. OTW gets dynamically generated URLs as takedown notices, which covers too much. Carey: would love to be able to send a notice that confers red flags knowledge Hatfield: balance is askew. Onus should not always be on copyright owner. Osterreicher: tale of two takedowns. Last time, we're talking past each other. Now, maybe there's greater recognition of the plight of individual content creators. PANEL 2 Jonathan Band, Library Copyright Alliance. Doesn't like LJ ruling because 512 depends on moderation. Compliance with EU copyright directive makes that dangerous. The Motherless opinion undid some of the dangerous aspects. Sofia Castillo, AAP: Companies that rely on infringement as business model shouldn't get 512. Amendment is required. Stephen Carlisle, Nova Southeastern. 512 isn't workable from time and expense standpoint for individual copyright owners. In Google search, he easily found video with static album cover plus lyrics. Caleb Donaldson, Google: YouTube has paid $6B to copyright owners. Google has best-in-class removal tools. Ken Doroshow, RIAA: Cases are reading red flags knowledge out of the law. He's pleased to see repeat infringer rulings, but they were extreme cases that don't teach much. Doug Hudson, Etsy: he sees increasing fraud, including phishing, false takedowns, and gaming. Also fraud in counternotices. We need a better 512(f). We also need to simplify DMCA for microbusinesses. Pre-filters aren't one-size-fits-all, especially when applied to material other than digital files. Keith Kupferschmid, Copyright Alliance: mass copyright infringements are regular occurrence. ISPs are shielded from liability and encouraged to infringe. Courts added a new requirement of copyright registration. Loss of WHOIS. We're worse off than 2 years ago. Art Levy, AIMP. Courts write requirements out of DMCA. Service providers have less incentive to work with copyright owners. DMCA offers no remedy to small copyright owners. Peter Midgley, BYU Copyright Office: universities are unique in DMCA ecosystem. High burden of processing takedown notices. Sasha Moss, R Street: Consumers are using legal options. We need to migrate towards those. Mary Rasenburger, Author Guild: many members do self-publishing. Ebook piracy has blossomed. Notice-and-takedown is an absurd way to deal with piracy. Services aren't cooperating with rightsowners. Look to EU Directive as model. Amer: re repeat infringer policies, have recent decisions clarified the law? Are there conflicts among the decisions? Midgely: recent caselaw hasn't been as helpful. Only thing that is clear is that not enforcing policy is a problem. How can IAPs implement airtight repeat infringer policy? Many notices purport to be based on 512(c), but really target 512(a) activity. His office often refers takedown notices to honor code office. Amer: is it possible to provide more clarity to universities? Midgely: Providing Internet access is not the university's primary function. It must do a cost-benefit of providing Internet access. If it's difficult for IAPs in the business to implement repeat infringement policy, it's even more difficult for non-IAPs. 512(e) is useless but maybe could be salvaged. Also, HEOA requires the university to provide notice to the university community about repeat infringer policy. Band: libraries are another category of IAP, also not susceptible to standards from Cox or Grande. Many library users have no other Internet access. Some laws require Internet access, and library may be only resource. Smith: should libraries educate users about repeat infringement? Band: libraries, especially in higher education, take that seriously. Isbell: do libraries think they fit in 512(a)? Band: yes Greenberg: at last roundtable, IAPs referred to 'adjudicated' repeat infringers. Still true? Band: there are different IAPs with different views. Repeat infringer doesn't mean alleged infringer, but courts are going in different direction. Amer: what statutory changes should be made to repeat infringer standard? Band: no need to change the statute. Everything depends on 'appropriate circumstances' language. Castillo: it wasn't hard for Cox/Grande to implement a policy. Cox didn't try. Grande didn't have a policy at all. Copyright Office should say (1) services should consistently and meaningfully implement a policy, (2) services should keep a log of its actions, and (3) services should prevent re-registration by terminated infringers. 512(i)(1) requires notice to users of repeat infringer policy, and Motherless' policy didn't say it. Midgely: what should service do when it gets conflicting info, such as a user who denies infringement. For the university, it's unclear how to distinguish 'system' from 'network' termination. Donaldson: courts are looking at nature and size of platforms, and that's good. Repeat infringer policies should have variation because of the amount of resources each platform has. Doroshow: rightsholders had to send millions of notices before it produced caselaw on repeat infringer policy. Also, terminated users keep coming back because there's no 'know your customer' rule. Amer: how do rightsowners provide notice to 512(a) services? Doroshow: RIAA does this. Rasenberger: Copyright Office should provide best practices guidance for topics like repeat infringer or red flags. Moss: PTO has hotline for inventors. Copyright Office could offer something similar for rightsowners. Smith: The Copyright Office's public information office fields many inquiries. Kupferschmid: 'one size doesn't fit all' should apply to notices by copyright owners as well. Smaller owners can't afford to do what RIAA does. Amer: Re 'stored at direction of user' and 'no duty to monitor' provisions. What is role of human monitoring? Band: law is muddled. Content moderation goes way beyond copyright. Amer: if Mavrix wasn't 'stored at direction of the service,' what would be? Band: we shouldn't put platforms in the impossible decision of thinking that undertaking content review will end the safe harbor. Castillo: screening material shouldn't end safe harbor. If service is screening for substance and not infringement, it should lose safe harbor. Services have incentives not to look. She disagrees with 512(m) interpretation. It was intended to protect privacy laws like ECPA. It's been incorrectly interpreted more broadly. Greenberg: what is the distinction between screening for legal and illegal content? Carlisle: content moderation is good, and we should encourage it. Sites should require uploaders to represent and warrant that they have the necessary rights. We could ask uploaders if they own content, have proper license, or in public domain. Donaldson: Google TOS already has this provision. Content ID resolves 98% of disputes on YouTube. If you can recognize the song, so can Content ID. Content Match allows smaller owners to find potential infringement. 400k are using the tool. Smith: how do we know that content owners accepted Content ID? Donaldson: music industry is plagued by incomplete data. Levy: Many independent songwriters don't have a deal with Google. Amer: is Content ID more available to smaller rightsowners? Donaldson: some aggregators represent smaller creators. Amer: why isn't Content ID available to everyone? Donaldson: possibility of misidentification of authorized Content ID users. Doroshow: if a service is benefiting from infringing content and has tools to screen them out, it should lose safe harbor. There are alternatives to Content ID that are cheaper and more widely available. Greenberg: what technologies have been added to the ecosystem? Have any become standard technical measures? Donaldson: Content ID isn't static. $40M investment in last 3 years. Hudson: filtering technology can't pick up all of the long tail. Adding filtering requirement doesn't solve the problem. Amer: what about uploading the full work? Why can't filtering technology pick that up? Hudson: what if the work is a quilt? Too much focus on works that start out as digital. Greenberg: what about T-shirt with full movie poster depicted? Hudson: vintage T-shirt/poster can't be determined Smith: has Etsy changed its policy after Zazzle? Hudson: Etsy is a pure marketplace. No print-on-demand, no drop-shopping. So Zazzle is different. Kupferschmid: filtering can account for wide range of circumstances. If something gets flagged, the service could ask the user for clarification. Band: SSRN pre-reviews content to determine which category to place it in Amer: that sounds like volitional conduct Band: the uploading is at user's direction Amer: but if service has choice to post, that's volitional Rasenberger: TOS isn't enough to verify. Every site should require uploads to declare the legal basis for uploading. Also, what about clear bad actors who hide behind 512? She gave example of ebook.bike. Authors don't have any choice but to litigate, but they can't afford to do it. Isbell: Congress never intended to cover bad actors. Rasenberger: YouTube and Shelter Capital rulings protect bad actors. Isbell: is the answer to pull back 512 for everyone, or just find ways to exclude bad actors? Rasenberger: there should be regulations on red flags. Knowledge should not require specific item at specific location. Moss: uploaders don't know what fair use is. Upload filters don't work. Moderator's dilemma. Levy: Lenz is major problem to 512(f). Copyright owner must consider fair use. Doing 4 point analysis for each potentially infringing work is too much. Greenberg: are automated notices are still OK after Lenz? Levy: final ruling didn't clarify. Hudson: platforms can't make fair use determination. Carlisle: Fair use is complex. Independent musician can't figure it out before sending notice. Amer: statute assumes copyright owners comparatively have the most knowledge. Isn't that the basic bargain of the statute? Carlisle: Putting burden on copyright owners is the wrong bargain. Smith: 512(f) doesn't apply to honest mistakes. Carlisle: Lenz case was hard Smith: the 'knowing' requirement helps 512(f) defendants Carlisle: musicians can be aggressive about asserting their rights, and they think any similarity is infringing Castillo: the counternotice system protects legal content, and it works. [both Rebecca and I chuckled at that] Band: courts hold bad guys liable. Sometimes rightsowners make dubious calls about who is a bad guy. Rasenberger: Amazon uses fingerprinting and they are good at keeping infringers off the site PANEL 3 Richard Burgess, AIMP; not much has changed from 2017. Still want staydown, send lots of notices, can't block repeat infringers Alex Feerst, Medium: 10k posts/day. The Moderator's Dilemma and the problem with red flags. Devlin Hartline, George Mason: 512 wasn't intended as notice-and-takedown. Service providers were expected to prevent infringement without input from copyright owners. Red flag knowledge standard was meant for this purpose. Google can index Pirate Bay shows how far things got out of hand. Red flag knowledge is general knowledge of infringement. [smh] Cathy Gellis, Copia Institute: don't let Sky is Falling rhetoric dominate. Sky is Rising. What effect of unadjudicated claims of infringement? Eric Goldman: [see my blog post on Section 512(f)[6]] Joe Gratz: not many 512 cases, which signals the rough consensus among industry players. The cases show the flexibility of the law. Jared Polin, FroKnowsPhoto: He makes a living at YouTube and gives away all of his content, and he supports 2 employees. Tamber Ray, Rural Broadband Association: Often members are the only broadband providers in their community. They struggle with takedowns, and they are terminating users. They would like guidance on repeat infringer policy. Bob Schwartz, Consumer Technology Association: curation can't be a disqualifier for safe harbor Christian Troncoso, BSA: DMCA works largely as intended. Frustration on both sides shows the compromises works. Kate Tummarello, Engine: startups like DMCA because it reduces risk of ruinous litigation Ping Wang, freelancer: favors EU copyright directive Nancy Wolff, Digital Media Licensing Association: Internet would be empty without visual content, but no incentives for collaboration between service providers and content providers. Fingerprinting technology isn't being used. Isbell: At last hearing, Gratz said 512(f) needed more teeth, such as statutory damages. Still feels that way? Gratz: 512(f) doesn't deter for many kinds of abuses (notices and counternotices). Not many lawsuits because not enough at stake to support litigation. He expects more lawsuits because marketplaces encourage competitive gaming Isbell: Etsy mentioned more fraud in notices/counternotices Greenberg: is legal standard the same for notices and counternotices? Goldman: yes Smith: if we loosen legal standard on 512(f), won't that hurt counternotices? Goldman: counternotices are relatively small part of ecosystem, so we should focus on abusive notices as the principal problem Polin: YouTube has good counternotice procedure Wolff: counternotice makes it harder for copyright owners, who are then forced to court. When counternotices are wrong, it hurts copyright owners Wang: search engine runs ads on my content Gratz: if people don't send counternotices, it's not because of fears about 512(f) liability Gellis: 512(g) undermines anonymous users. Fewer deterrences for sending 512(a) notices. People are sending notices to create strikes against targeted people Greenberg: is there evidence of competitive gaming via strikes? Hartline: bogus takedowns are a problem, but it's a forest-for-trees problem. Google has been asked to remove 4B URLs, and most notices requesting those removals were legit. Wrong takedowns are a small problem in comparison. Lenz is wrong because it expects senders to have to actively formed good faith belief before sending. Feerst: Medium engages with senders of non-compliant DMCA notices. A substantial number of senders don't appreciate the gravity of the legal consequences of sending the notice. Many notices are sloppy, and the senders won't engage with Medium to fix it. Smith: the law gives you enough time to go back-and-forth with senders? Feerst: Medium takes that risk because 'expeditiously' isn't clear. Medium does it because they care. Burgess: worried about Gellis' fact claims. Most labels have given up on notice-and-takedown. Content is the golden goose, not the Internet. Rightsowners own the stuff, we're not responsible for other people's misuse. Music industry is now 1/3 of what it was 20 years ago. Polin: I don't want to see gatekeepers shutting the gates again. I can make money by giving content away for free. Isbell: what is optimal way to have notice-and-takedown? Sloppy notices and high volume; vs. content creators frustrated they have to use a form rather than sending email Ray: members are getting notices at email addresses that aren't the official one; also getting duplicate notices that need deduping. Wolff: Lenz hasn't changed landscape. Visual artists always do manual review before sending notices. Many have given up. Greenberg: Google gets less notices now than at its peak in 2016. Why? Gratz: vast bulk of content taken down never appeared in Google in first place Troncoso: no perfect takedown notice system. Diversity of services and content owners. DMCA supports bespoke systems to develop. Schwartz: burden has to be on rightsholders. Goldman: much activity is outside of 512(c)/512(f) now: fast lane for rightsholders giving them trusted removal authority that doesn't constitute a 512(c)(3) notice; and automated filters that kill content before it goes live, which also doesn't implicate 512(c) or 512(f). Wang: wants to know how much Google earns from my works. Hartline: Lenz is wrong. Do rightsholders need to consider all considerations beyond fair use? Amer: why isn't fair use part of the legal evaluation? Hartline: not knowing about fair use isn't proof of subjective bad faith Burgess: no artists believe DMCA is working. Isbell: what about 512(h) and 512(j)? [note: my notes on 512(h) and 512(j) got a little garbled because Isbell initially referenced a Strike 3 ruling about 512(i), when it actually involved 512(h) [this case[7]], and I multi-tasked to figure out what she was referring to] Goldman: 512(h) is an anachronism. We don't see other non-judicially supervised mandatory disclosure of identity in other legal doctrines. It's supported copyright trolling, where the plaintiffs use it for extrajudicial remedies. It's also not consistent with modern privacy laws. WHOIS and 512(h) are 1990s solutions, not 2010s solutions. Isbell: 512(j)? Goldman: few cases discuss 512(j), but it's an essential part of the DMCA scheme. 512 doesn't eliminate liability, it only protects against financial damages and channels injunctions to 512(j) Gratz: the 512(j) injunction leads to the same outcome as collaboration would produce Isbell: more comments on repeat infringers? Tummarello: small companies need certainty/clarity on repeat infringer policy Schwartz: in Cox, the evidence about DMCA takedown was counted against Cox for contributory infringement Gellis: determining what constitutes infringement is hard, so counting repeat infringement is imprecise Smith: not sympathetic to the free expression of infringers in Cox Gratz: continuum between IAPs and content services. Packingham shows the importance of Internet access. Greenberg: since Cox, do IAPs now see themselves as subject to same knowledge standards? Ray: can IAPs ignore emails sent to non-official email address? Grande opinion puts big obligation on IAPs and didn't consider the balance between valid and invalid notices. Also, what about public wi-fi? FCC and state regulators consider Internet access an 'essential service' with rules about termination of service Feerst: we can't afford to go to summary judgment on repeat infringer policy. PANEL 4 Joined by Emily Lanza, Office of Policy and International Affairs. Smith and Greenberg stepped off the stage. Carlo Lavizzari, Internationl STM Association: implementation is key. Stan Adams, CDT: 512 &gt; Articles 11 ... Eric Cady, IFTA. Members don't have way to stop global infringement. Most are small and medium sized film producers. Encouraged by EU Copyright Directive as way to rebalance notice-and-takedown. Danielle Coffey, News Media Alliance: wants quality journalism. Alec French, advocate: giving a safe harbor was an unfortunate pricetag of the rest of the DMCA. Limit DMCA to Internet startups; shouldn't privilege Internet giants. Ashley Freedman, ITI: DMCA balances innovation Josh Lamel, Re:create: Copyright Directive will hurt US startups. Creative industry has increased profits; and piracy is down. Creators are bypassing traditional intermediaries. Stan McCoy, MPAA Europe: they support no-fault injunctive relief, but the Directive didn't go enough. Corynne McSherry, EFF: copyright policy is speech policy and innovation policy. If EU forces upload filters, they will catch lawful non-infringing content. Content ID regularly misidentifies content despite its $100M cost. Katie Oyama, Google: Directive will harm Europe, especially due to overblocking. Chris Randle, Facebook: Facebook is taking innovative steps to protect copyright, with the encouragement of DMCA. Steve Rosenthal, McGraw Hill: WHOIS database is integral to pursuing infringers. Matt Schruers, CCIA: growth in the creative system. Lui Simpson, AAP: web blocking is in 40 countries and it hasn't broken the Internet Sherwin Siy, Wikimedia: Directive isn't model law. It's unclear, novel, uncertain, and internally inconsistent. Wikimedia is large site but small user base. The rules don't fit unusual sites like this. Abby Vollmer, GitHub: GitHub got carveout to Article 13, but many other services didn't. Rachel Wolbers, Engine: startup exception isn't workable. Strong: will EU Copyright Directive affect American businesses doing business in Europe and in US? Lazzari: does Article 13 codify ECJ caselaw about structurally infringing websites? Two cases are pending (YouTube ...sevier). Also, he hopes that sites allowing anonymous submissions are still held to higher standard. Simmons: recital says that it codifies existing law. RapidShare ruling will still be good law Vollmer: filtering will affect GitHub despite its exception. Open source code often compiles code from many sources, and filtering could detect and break any of them Siy: it may be impossible to upload works to Wikimedia Commons Cady: positives: requires license authorizations, and requires staydowns. Strong: how will authorizations be available? Cady: members license exclusively, so they may not be willing to license their works to platforms Lazzari: creates incentive for rightsholders and platforms to cooperate, so works should be available. McCoy: Berne Convention may prevent formalities before Internet companies are liable. Many members don't want to license movies to platforms, so this will require enforcement (but maybe filtering will reduce the problem). Oyama: Directive imposes direct liability. What will constitute sufficient notice? More than 50% of money they pay is based on UGC, and that revenue is at risk. Schruers: filtering obligations are unmanageable. Only filters are available for AV works, but filtering mandates apply to all works Simpson: EU will adopt proportionality and reasonableness. Law will 'nudge' the creation of filters for non-AV works. [if the EU Copyright Directive is a nudge, I shudder to think what she thinks a punch in the face looks like] McSherry: copyrights have limitations. Licensing regime overrides those limitations. Filtering is required, but nothing is clear beyond that. Investors are chilled, and the startup exception doesn't help with that. Wolbers: Startups look at scalability. Different legal regimes require different platforms. This isn't feasible; plus filtering cost. Startup carveout creates perverse incentives. Isbell: EU digital single market was supposed to negate different platforms in EU. Don't we already have splinternets? Lamel: Not all creators are the same, and they may want different things. No trade association represents the 17 million people in US who distribute content through platforms completely independently. We should be fighting human rights abuses in other countries' laws Coffey: Article 11 creates compilation copyright for news publishers. Local US publishers may be able to benefit from the right. Adams: startups will conform to most stringent rules, which requires licensing/filtering, which negates fair use. Lazzari: startups shouldn't build system that will be victim of its own success. If you want to build UGC, build compliance upfront. But bakeries are safe [it will be a shame to lose UGC on the Internet, but I'm glad we'll still have baguettes] Siy: consider privacy implications Schruers: Directive breaks single digital market Lanza: how do you advise startups which international laws to comply with and which to ignore? Schruers: many rules are honored in the breach. Wait for governments to block. Oyama: criticism of the Thai king is different from determining when works are infringing. Every work is copyrighted. Strong: over 40 countries have adopted IAP site blocking obligations. McCoy: loves site-blocking, and its proliferation around the world shows its popularity. It functions well, and none of the predicted dire consequences have come to pass. Good complement to notice-and-takedown; it increases the copyright owner's toolkit. His only criticism is that some member-states haven't adopted it. Simpson: McGraw has pursued site blocking remedy in 6 countries. Rightsowners are careful not to abuse the rights because they are budget-constrained. Oyama: globally, there are abuses of site blocking. Google does demotion for takedown requests; they have demoted 66k sites. Demotions apply globally. McCoy: praised Google's demotion policy. Simpson: Canada's notice-and-notice policy does nothing McCoy: Belgian IAPs are willing to voluntarily block in some cases Lamel: US IAP market is less competitive than in other countries. Wolbers: many platforms offer their own private dispute resolution mechanisms Schruers: diversity of services means that most solutions don't scale across different sectors. Simpson: DMCA doesn't do a good job distinguishing IAPs from other online services. Strong: repeat infringer policies outside the US? Simpson: not needed because rightsowners go to court anyway Isbell: wouldn't you do both? Simpson: if service pushes back, go to court. McSherry: cutting off Internet access to a household has severe consequences to the household. French: if you're as big and rich as Google, you don't deserve DMCA protection Lamel: copyright policy is looped into broader Internet policy Vollmer: no one fits into startup exception to Copyright Directive Amer: complying with DMCA is voluntary, but it provides big benefit. Does the voluntariness reduce the concerns about IAP termination? Siy: given alternative of strict liability and statutory damages, DMCA safe harbor compliance isn't really voluntary Lamel; lack of IAP competition. Also, IAPs and content producers are merging. Both AT...nd Comcast are members of MPAA McCoy: ECJ has done the work balancing the interest of terminating Internet access OPEN MIC Janice at Rutgers, but speaking as member of public: 512 litigation can't fix it. There is a permanent conflict between services and rightsowners, and protection increases services' wealth. Give creative people their rights back. Big companies are backing activists to fight EU directive. Big companies take advantage of flaws in 512. A technical war was waged against EU directive; and Copyright Office was hacked when 512 comments were due. Free speech claims are used to justify ripping off the public. Kupferschmid: when copyright owners take on burden, they have little to show for it without staydown. They are teaching creators not to send fraudulent notices. CASE Act would enable 512(f) small claims. No defendant could come up with example of red flag knowledge. Fourth Estate case created new DMCA filing requirement [but it's not new\u2014the statute was always clear that registration was required for enforcement] Rasenberger: one writer says she spends 50% of her time on enforcement. Does the US want to protect copyright? If so, amend 512. Internet platforms have drained money out of content industries. Shame on us if we don't fix this. The EU has the courage to fix this. We should too. 512(j) relief is narrow and its application is uncertain. Authors band together to send takedown notices to deliberately demote sites in Google. Pariser: she wants a separate roundtable just about standard technical measures, because filtering is so ubiquitous. The number of notices being sent is dropping, but that's not due to reduction in piracy (even though in past roundtables it was claimed that notices rising was a good measure of piracy increases) because of notice-sending fatigue + only sending notices to demote site on Google + shifts of piracy away from P2P/torrents and towards search. Tech companies are making vast money and content is relatively shrinking. Internet services spend a tiny fraction of revenue on anti-piracy efforts Vicki from RIAA: concern about streamripping. Recording revenues are rising but nowhere near the peak Hatfield: no one can compete with free. He's worried about monopsony. Musicians thought they were bypassing record labels, but at least they invested in artists. Musicians just want fair and equitable percentage, and without their content the tech giant platforms will be less valuable. Goldman: UMG v. Shelter Capital[8] provided a specific example of what constitutes red flags knowledge (third party notices can create such knowledge). It is possible to compete with free\u2014Polin showed us that. Google and Facebook are not the Internet, and regulators are screwing up by enacting anti-Facebook/anti-Google laws that destroy the rest of the Internet. Section 230 has extensive caselaw about what constitutes editorial curation, and it provides an instructive model. Content that starts out as third party content remains third party content regardless of what happens to it, but Batzel excludes content from 230 that was never meant for publication.

Frank[1] The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is supposed to protect the public by regulating the Telecom Industry. Experts say they've done a lousy of job[2] of this for a while now[3]. Employees tend to go back and forth between working for the Telecoms and the FCC which is a big part of the problem. It's no surprise that the agency is currently being investigated for collusion[4] with the Telecom Industry[5] in regard to very unpopular federal 5G technology legislation[6] that was passed in September. </p><p>\ufeffThis federal legislation eliminated local control[7] and environmental review[8] of harmful small cell technology installation[9]. The Telecom Industry won't testify that 5G[10] is safe. In fact, no one[11] will say it's safe - except apparently FCC employees: \ufeff How's that for loyalty! Thanks to Scientists 4 Wired Tech[12] for alerting us to an article about recently departed commissioner, Mignon Clyburn, and her new job lobbying for T-Mobile. Revolving door regulators in the telecom sector are certainly nothing new.Current FCC boss Ajit Pai previously worked for Verizon. Former FCC Commissioner Meredith Attwell Baker subsequently lobbied for both the wireless sector and Comcast. Former FCC boss Michael Powell is now the head of the NCTA[13], cable industry's biggest lobbying organization. Former FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell was already on T-Mobile's payroll[14], telling anybody who'll listen the megadeal will be 'great for America.'Of course, former FCC chairman, Tom Wheeler,[15] has always been in a league of his own[16]:Thomas Wheeler has been influencing communications policy in Washington[17] for a long time, but always from the sidelines. He ran what was then the National Cable Television Association and then the Cellular Telephone Industry Association until he was driven out in House Majority Leader Tom De Lay's purge of Democrats[18] at trade associations. He was a top advisor for Vice President Al Gore and a key member of President Obama's 2008 transition team. Now he is about to move to center stage as Obama's pick to head the Federal Communications Commission.[embedded content] [embedded content] [embedded content] Insurance companies[19] haven't been covering telecom companies for many years. Telecom companies have been warning shareholders[20] for many years that eventually they may be held LIABLE[21] for deceptive practices and harm from their devices and infrastructure. [embedded content] It's no wonder 'Big Tech'/'Big Wireless' continues to be compared to 'Big Tobacco'[22] and 'Big Oil.'

Such regulation would make the internet safer, more secure and more enjoyable for all users.</p><p>Eric Hilkert ([email protected]) is a junior majoring in finance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3418972</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3F-4K81-JBSN-33XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Badger Herald: University of Wisconsin - Madison</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 10, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Madison</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>WI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Cyclical assets including gold, small-caps, and high-yield bonds sank.The shifts \"are consistent with investors seeking (relatively) safe assets as concerns rise about moderating growth and inflation disappointment,\" Draho said.Market participants can expect high growth uncertainty to \"delay a sustained rotation towards more economically-sensitive assets,\" Draho added.Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories[2]. September brought heightened stock market volatility and a mass rotation out of tech giants, but the most recent week of returns signals a new concern gripping investors.Returns across the stock, bond, currency, and commodity markets point to increasing risks to economic growth and inflation, Jason Draho, head of asset allocation in the Americas at UBS[3], said in a Monday note. Last week saw investors pivot back to long-dated Treasurys, the US dollar, and large-cap growth stocks.More cyclical assets such as small-cap stocks, emerging market equities, gold, and high-yield bonds all tumbled over the period. </p><p>Inflation expectations fell and 10-year real rates climbed slightly, reflecting a more bearish outlook toward price growth.The returns data can easily drive \"spurious conclusions,\" but the shifts \"are consistent with investors seeking (relatively) safe assets as concerns rise about moderating growth and inflation disappointment,\" Draho wrote.Read more: BANK OF AMERICA: Buy these 11 stocks to profit as e-commerce and robotics revolutionize their businesses and keep them growing faster than peers[4]Those investors aren't without cause for concern. While some facets of the economy have roared back to their pre-pandemic highs, others remain mired in the coronavirus pandemic's fallout and have slowed their pace of recovery. New US jobless claims unexpectedly climbed to 870,000 filings[5] for the week ended September 19, missing the economist estimate of 840,000 claims. Nonfarm payrolls data slated for release on Friday is expected to show the unemployment rate fall through September, but by a much smaller amount than in months prior.Gauges of consumer spending also point to a stagnating rebound. Retail sales climbed by just 0.6% in August[6], missing the consensus estimate of 1% growth and halving from July's 1.2% uptick.Investors' moves to safe havens are even more justified when looking ahead, Draho said. Hopes for new stimulus ahead of the November US presidential election are all but entirely dashed, with both parties' proposals still far from meeting in the middle. Rising COVID case counts in Europe recently renewed concerns of partial economic lockdowns, and cases are steadily rising in the US as well. Lastly, the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting left some wanting greater detail around the central bank's forward guidance.In all, concerns of slowing economic growth \"are likely to linger for at least a couple of months,\" Draho said. The upcoming election is set to push volatility higher, and uncertainties around the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine will keep some from returning to financial markets.Risk appetites could improve in early 2021 if Congress passes new stimulus and a vaccine wins regulatory approval, but investors shouldn't get their hopes up for a near-term reversal from last week, Draho said.\"For now, expect structurally high growth uncertainty to keep volatility elevated and delay a sustained rotation towards more economically-sensitive assets,\" he added.Now read more markets coverage from Markets

After the September tech-stock correction ended, investors lifted long-dated Treasurys , the US dollar, and large-cap growth stocks. Cyclical assets including gold, small-caps, and high-yield bonds sank.  The shifts \"are consistent with investors seeking (relatively) safe assets as concerns rise about moderating growth and inflation disappointment,\" Draho said.  Market participants can expect high growth uncertainty to \"delay a sustained rotation towards more economically-sensitive assets,\" Draho added.  Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories .   September brought heightened stock market volatility and a mass rotation out of tech giants, but the most recent week of returns signals a new concern gripping investors.    Returns across the stock, bond, currency, and commodity markets point to increasing risks to economic growth and inflation, Jason Draho, head of asset allocation in the Americas at UBS , said in a Monday note. Last week saw investors pivot back to long-dated Treasurys, the US dollar, and large-cap growth stocks.  More cyclical assets such as small-cap stocks, emerging market equities, gold, and high-yield bonds all tumbled over the period. Inflation expectations fell and 10-year real rates climbed slightly, reflecting a more bearish outlook toward price growth.The returns data can easily drive \"spurious conclusions,\" but the shifts \"are consistent with investors seeking (relatively) safe assets as concerns rise about moderating growth and inflation disappointment,\" Draho wrote.

While some facets of the economy have roared back to their pre-pandemic highs, others remain mired in the coronavirus pandemic's fallout and have slowed their pace of recovery. New US jobless claims unexpectedly climbed to 870,000 filings for the week ended September 19, missing the economist estimate of 840,000 claims. Nonfarm payrolls data slated for release on Friday is expected to show the unemployment rate fall through September, but by a much smaller amount than in months prior.    Gauges of consumer spending also point to a stagnating rebound. Retail sales climbed by just 0.6% in August , missing the consensus estimate of 1% growth and halving from July's 1.2% uptick.  Investors' moves to safe havens are even more justified when looking ahead, Draho said. Hopes for new stimulus ahead of the November US presidential election are all but entirely dashed, with both parties' proposals still far from meeting in the middle. Rising COVID case counts in Europe recently renewed concerns of partial economic lockdowns, and cases are steadily rising in the US as well. Lastly, the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting left some wanting greater detail around the central bank's forward guidance.  In all, concerns of slowing economic growth \"are likely to linger for at least a couple of months,\" Draho said. The upcoming election is set to push volatility higher, and uncertainties around the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine will keep some from returning to financial markets .  Risk appetites could improve in early 2021 if Congress passes new stimulus and a vaccine wins regulatory approval, but investors shouldn't get their hopes up for a near-term reversal from last week, Draho said.    \"For now, expect structurally high growth uncertainty to keep volatility elevated and delay a sustained rotation towards more economically-sensitive assets,\" he added.

Ashcroft says his hands are tied because his fellow Republicans in the Legislature designated part of the law an \"emergency,\" meaning it cannot be overturned by referendum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That throws it to the courts to decide whether the Legislature's emergency designation was made in good faith, or if it was - as is obvious - merely a ploy to deny voters any opportunity to have input. So far, the ploy has worked.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is no emergency here. GOP extremists have commandeered Missouri's state government and launched an all-out assault on the self-determination rights of women - even rape and incest victims - and now are muzzling public opposition to it. The American Civil Liberties Union has justifiably filed a court challenge in hopes of getting this question onto the ballot, giving voters a chance to build a firewall against this radical agenda.</p><p>This newspaper generally opposes government by referendum. Voters elect representatives for a reason. But the Legislature's Republican supermajority is out of control and out of step with Missouri's citizens. Consider how often voters in statewide referendums have reversed lawmakers on issues like the minimum wage, labor rights and ethics. Those and other reversals expose how broken representative government is in Missouri.</p><p>The newly signed abortion law is further proof of it. It outlaws all abortions at eight weeks, a point at which many women don't even know they're pregnant, and provides no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Polls show majorities of citizens in Missouri, as around the nation, oppose such extreme restrictions.</p><p>Which explains why the Legislature was so careful to act preemptively to keep voters out of the process. A designated \"emergency\" section of the law requires pregnant teens to inform both parents, in addition to the current rule of just getting one parent's consent, before obtaining an abortion. Ashcroft argues the emergency clause puts the whole law out of reach of being changed by referendum.</p><p>The one-parent consent rule has been in place for decades, disproving the claim of an emergency need to expand it. Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, exposed the radicals' true motives when he recently told St. Louis Public Radio that the goal was to block the possibility of a voter override: \"What we did in the bill is actually preempt that type of situation by putting an emergency clause in there. So there can't be a referendum.\"</p><p>That comment, which is included in the ACLU's lawsuit seeking to get one of the measures onto the ballot, couldn't be clearer: The emergency designation is a strategic lie put there to prevent a majority of Missouri voters from interfering with this Legislature's war on women.</p><p>_____</p><p>The Kansas City Star, June 7</p><p>Black drivers in Missouri 91% more likely to be stopped than whites. Where's the outrage?</p><p>Driving while black in Missouri is becoming an even more perilous proposition.</p><p>Two years after the NAACP issued a travel advisory warning black motorists of the potential problems with traveling through Missouri, a new report finds that in 2018, black drivers in Missouri were 91% more likely to be pulled over than white motorists.</p><p>Our state has long had an abysmal record on racial disparities in vehicle stops, but Missouri keeps finding ways to regress further, the latest annual report released by Attorney General Eric Schmitt's office shows.</p><p>The numbers have gotten worse every year in the recent past, and it's no wonder: Lawmakers and state officials have made little to no effort to put a stop to such discriminatory practices.</p><p>In 2017, black motorists were 85% more likely to be stopped than white drivers. The number was 75% in 2016 and 69% in 2015.</p><p>The most recent report also shows that people of color are disproportionately stopped and searched by law enforcement. Black and Hispanic drivers were 1.48 and 1.4 times more likely, respectively, to have their vehicles searched than white drivers, despite the fact both groups were slightly less likely than whites to possess contraband.</p><p>The data should serve as a wake-up call for law enforcement officials, who have spent years lobbying against efforts to combat racial profiling.</p><p>\"Without significant reform, Missouri will remain a state where minority drivers are harassed and unsafe,\" said Sara Baker, legislative and policy director for ACLU of Missouri.</p><p>The ACLU has called on the Missouri legislature and Gov. Mike Parson to support the Fourth Amendment Affirmation Act to move beyond data collection to actually requiring consequences for officers who engage in racial profiling.</p><p>Republican state Rep. Shamed Dogan of St. Louis County suggested members of the General Assembly solicit feedback from law enforcement, prosecutors, defense attorneys, civil rights groups and others in a series of meetings throughout the state this summer. Kansas City will host a meeting at a still-to-be-determined time, he said.</p><p>In each of the last four years, Dogan has introduced the Fourth Amendment Affirmation Act, which would hold individual officers and departments accountable for profiling. The legislation advanced through a House committee last spring but failed to get a hearing in the Senate. This year, the bipartisan measure stalled in the House.</p><p>\"We went backwards,\" Dogan said.</p><p>Racial profiling by police is already outlawed in Missouri. But the law imposes few, if any, consequences for officers or departments that violate the statute.</p><p>Dogan's bill would identify problem officers and offer training and other remedies before they could be fired. Departments would have up to six years to get their collective acts together. The attorney general's office could withhold state funding if a department failed to comply.</p><p>For too long, there have been no ramifications for officers or departments that disproportionately target people of color in vehicle stops.</p><p>\"If you don't have any teeth in that law that bans racial profiling, then you won't get compliance,\" Dogan said.</p><p>It's been nearly 20 years since Missouri started collecting racial profiling data to combat unfair treatment by law enforcement against minorities. And the data clearly indicates Missouri has a serious problem with discriminatory policing.</p><p>But, as state Sen. Karla May, a Democrat from St. Louis, has said: What is the state going to do about it?</p><p>_____</p><p>The St. Joseph News-Press, June 10</p><p>Leviathan returns, in digital form</p><p>Ida Tarbell earned a reputation as a muckraker for expos\u00e9s that resulted in the eventual breakup of the Standard Oil Company.</p><p>More than a century later, Sen. Josh Hawley carries more of an establishment aura, with his education at elite universities and experience as a law clerk for the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>Both Tarbell and Hawley share a common trait in their skepticism of the leviathan of the day: Standard Oil in 1900 and Big Tech, including Google and Facebook, in 2019.</p><p>At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Hawley turned the focus from the Russia investigation to Big Tech companies and his concerns about anti-competitive conduct, potential bias and privacy violations. Unlike the Mueller report, Hawley finds a more receptive audience on the other side of the aisle. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, hardly a political ally, expressed concern about the \"handful of gatekeepers\" that control search engines, online commerce and information sharing.</p><p>Up until now, Hawley and like-minded lawmakers took aim at relatively low-hanging fruit, like data collection on children.</p><p>Bigger issues loom on the horizon, with news that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have agreed to divide up antitrust scrutiny of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. These tech giants now find themselves in the regulatory crosshairs, with Facebook and Google seen as the most vulnerable to some sort of action.</p><p>Few tears will be shed for companies that built up unprecedented influence in culture and politics, making them an easy target of the left and the right. Elected officials and regulators will have to tread carefully between concerns about perceived bias - one person's political leanings can be another's free expression - and look to broader issues of market dominance and the way search engine content is prioritized, personal data is collected and online ad revenue is directed primarily to Facebook and Google.</p><p>Here Europe's regulation watchdog - another odd ideological bedfellow for American politicians who decry regulation - has taken a more aggressive role in trying to rein in Big Tech. The European Union recently fined Google for forcing customers to advertise exclusively through its AdSense service.</p><p>These are issues Tarbell never encountered with Standard Oil. One new wrinkle is how technology companies offer plenty of shipping, searching and sharing services for free. This is not the normal business model for a monopoly that seeks to squelch competition.</p><p>Perhaps regulators and legislative critics will find that free is still too expensive, that these companies exact a heavy price in the way that personal data is collected and shared, often without the knowledge of the end user.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-831d1000f45e4f258c3c2ebfe6100146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-MKN1-DYN6-W4SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1563\"/><timeReceived>1:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Josh Hawley is serious about his battle against \"big tech,\" the greatest victory he could win would be restoring net neutrality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawley, in his first term, has targeted large technology firms such as Google and Facebook with upcoming legislation. He has announced legislation in two areas, targeting software publishers that market loot boxes and pay-to-win microtransactions to kids, and calling for a \"do not call list\"-style option to bar companies from tracking personal data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While there's nothing inherently concerning about either of these bills, they don't strike us as urgent. But those two measures are small shots in this hunt. If Hawley really wants to arm for bear against big tech, he could target internet service providers that would seek to limit customers from accessing whatever they choose.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Net neutrality is the philosophy that internet service providers should not limit or block content that its customers wish to access. That philosophy wasn't codified into law until 2015 when the FCC created its legal framework. But all that work was undone in 2017 when the FCC, led by chairman and presidential appointee Ajit Pai, undid the rules that bound service providers.</p><p>ISPs have a history of demonstrating the need for net neutrality - companies such as Comcast, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon have blocked customers from using websites or apps.</p><p>With the development of 5G networks in full swing, the internet is poised to be more important than ever for daily life. That's why net neutrality is important for us in Southwest Missouri:</p><p>. The Joplin Area Chamber of Commerce is showing members how the internet can boost their businesses. Net neutrality ensures fair markets and open competition without the threat of a big business unfairly closing parts of the playing field.</p><p>. People of all political persuasions use the internet to inform others about issues they feel are important. Sometimes, the internet is used to mobilize people to act. Companies should not be able to silence those voices with a flick of a switch.</p><p>. Area residents count on the internet for crucial information during times of emergency - we've seen how important streaming video on social networks becomes during tornado warnings.</p><p>. Readers across the region rely on a number of different news sources for information about local, state and national news. We suspect none of those readers would appreciate their chosen news source to be blocked by their provider.</p><p>The House has already passed the Save the Internet Act, which would restore the 2015 standards undone by the FCC. Hawley could make a difference today: He can use his influence to call for Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to bring the bill up for a vote.</p><p>Net neutrality is neither a liberal nor conservative issue. It's an American issue. And Hawley could be its champion.</p><p>_____</p><p>The Kansas City Star, June 3</p><p>The state of Missouri owes Jackson County almost $2 million. When will it pay up?</p><p>The Missouri Department of Corrections owes counties throughout the state more than $20 million for housing inmates bound for state prison.</p><p>The perpetual backlog and the state's unacceptably tardy reimbursements leave counties in the lurch. And Jackson County is near the top of that list.</p><p>The state owes Jackson County nearly $2 million. Some $730,000 is owed to Clay County; and nearly $430,000 is due to Platte County. The state is indebted to Cass County for $233,000.</p><p>State lawmakers have been unwilling to allocate the funds needed to chip away at the total owed to counties, which now stands somewhere between $20 million and $30 million. This year, legislators added only $1.75 million to the Department of Corrections' $40 million budget to address the backlog, KCUR reported last week.</p><p>Counties are eventually reimbursed for housing inmates who are convicted and sent to state prisons, but on average, the process usually takes about nine months.</p><p>And the state is falling further behind.</p><p>Jackson County was owed $800,000 in 2017. Two years later, the amount has more than doubled to just under $1.9 million.</p><p>\"The state has a statutory obligation to put more dollars into (Department of Corrections) funding,\" Cass County Sheriff Jeff Weber told The Star. \"Funding is an issue but one that has not been a priority.\"</p><p>In 2017, Missouri had the eighth-largest prison population in the country. The number has dropped about 8% since then. Close to 29,500 people are incarcerated in the state penal system, down from 32,000 two years ago.</p><p>Missouri Department of Corrections officials attribute the decline to some of the programs aimed at reducing the number of inmates who return to prison.</p><p>But the Department of Corrections will continue to operate in arrears until state lawmakers enact additional criminal justice reforms - or substantially increase funding to keep tens of thousands of inmates behind bars.</p><p>\"If we recognize it's a problem, we owe it to ourselves to find a solution,\" Weber said. \"We just haven't gotten there yet.\"</p><p>Other states have taken steps in the right direction, saving taxpayer dollars and reducing the prison population.</p><p>In 2010, South Carolina passed sentencing and corrections reforms that have saved the state close to $500 million. The recidivism rate decreased by 10%, and the overall prison population fell 14%.</p><p>Missouri could begin to reduce costs and the number of prisoners incarcerated if Gov. Mike Parson signs into law House Bill 192. The measure would eliminate so-called debtors prisons and would reduce the prison population by ending mandatory minimum sentences for some nonviolent crimes.</p><p>Allowing early parole for nonviolent offenders over the age of 65 would also spur declines in the number of inmates. Lawmakers had the opportunity to act on that reform this year, but a proposal stalled in the Senate during the recently-concluded legislative session.</p><p>When they reconvene next year, lawmakers must get serious about enacting substantial criminal justice reforms that have yielded impressive results across the country.</p><p>And even more urgently, state officials must develop a plan to settle up with counties in a timely manner. Jackson County can't afford to wait indefinitely for the money it's owed.</p><p>_____</p><p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, May 29</p><p>Missouri's latest attack on abortion rights is a reminder: Elections have consequences.</p><p>The ink was barely dry on Missouri's draconian new anti-abortion-rights law before state regulators delivered the second blow against women's control over their own bodies. Using - and blatantly abusing - their official licensing powers, regulators are threatening to shut down the last abortion provider in Missouri when its license expires Friday.</p><p>Contrast that with Illinois, where Democrats control state government: In response to the coordinated attacks on women's self-determination in Missouri and other red states, the Illinois Legislature is moving to shore up those rights.</p><p>The difference confirms the axiom that elections have consequences. In Missouri, low-income women, rape victims and others who are targeted in these new forced-birth policies are facing the consequences of voters allowing the reactionary right to take over the state.</p><p>The Missouri law that Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed Friday outlaws all abortions after eight weeks - when many women don't yet know they're pregnant - with the exception of abortions to save the life of the mother. There are no rape or incest exceptions.</p><p>It's one of a recent series of laws in red states that blatantly violate the abortion-rights protections under Roe v. Wade. That's the whole point: Anti-choice activists hope the inevitable court challenges will get them before today's conservative U.S. Supreme Court, with possibility of overturning Roe.</p><p>But Missouri's state health regulators, apparently unwilling to wait for that national showdown, have now maneuvered to shut down the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis - the last abortion provider in the state - with intimidation tactics that make a mockery of American democratic traditions.</p><p>As part of Planned Parenthood's license-renewal process, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which answers to Parson, is suddenly demanding interviews with doctors and others on staff, while making clear those interviews could lead to criminal proceedings or board review for the doctors. The obvious goal is to intimidate Planned Parenthood into refusing the interviews - which it has - so it can be denied its license renewal on Friday. Litigation is pending.</p><p>It's bad enough that politicians are writing laws to undercut women's rights to their own medical decisions, but now bureaucrats controlled by those politicians are misusing their regulatory power to go beyond even what these new laws would allow.</p><p>All of this, remember, is in service to one ultimate goal: To ensure that any woman who becomes pregnant, even via rape, can be forced by the government to carry the pregnancy to term.</p><p>Missouri voters in recent elections have handed their state over to an increasingly extremist party with which they disagree (judging from recent ballot measures) on the minimum wage, political ethics, organized labor and other issues. Now, elected extremists are attacking the fundamental biological rights of half the population.</p><p>Elections have consequences. Missourians should remember that next year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But her new book, After the Gig: How the Sharing Economy Got Hijacked and How to Win It Back (University of California Press, 2020), provides a longer and deeper view of these platform-based businesses thanks to research she and her team of graduate students have conducted since 2011. The book traces the evolution of companies brokering services such as local transport and lodging, from their quasi-idealistic origins to purely commercial businesses where revenue growth is often at the expense of the people actually delivering the services. MITSloan Management Review recently spoke with Schor \u2014 who, in addition to being a sociologist, also earned a Ph.D. in economics and taught the subject at Harvard for 17 years \u2014 to find out where the sharing economy has fallen short and how it could be improved.  MITSloan Management Review : What exactly do you mean when you say that the sharing economy was hijacked?  Schor: Most of these platforms were launched with an idealistic discourse. Founders typically espoused three benefits: economic, social, and environmental. Economically, they said the platforms would give workers more freedom \u2014 they could set their own schedules and not have a boss. And since many of these platforms were founded during the Great Recession, they also offered an opportunity for people to make money at a time when it was hard to find regular employment.   Socially, the platforms were promoted as enabling person-to-person exchanges. These personalized economic relations would lead to stronger social connections. The discourse promised environmental benefits \u2014 reduced carbon emissions in particular. The original idea for ride-sharing was that people already driving to a destination would pick up a passenger who wanted to travel in that direction, saving the emissions that passenger\u2019s solo trip would have produced. Airbnb talked about less construction of new hotels; you\u2019d use housing that already existed to lodge people. And TaskRabbit\u2019s origin story is that the founder needed dog food and thought, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if I could just find someone who was in the store already, and could pick up the food for me?\u201d   Of course, things didn\u2019t turn out that way. Some of those claims weren\u2019t plausible to begin with. But the hijacking happened when the platforms accepted more capital from investors, which created pressure for growth, which in turn led to their commercialization. Instead of the goal of a more efficient economy by sharing excess capacity, like a spare seat in a car or spare room in a house, the platforms shifted to a goal of growing through increased commercial activity. Drivers bought cars in order to drive for a ride-sharing service. People bought and rented out entire houses rather than just spare rooms.   The pressure for growth, and profits, drove down wages and working conditions. What began as \u201csharing\u201d became, at times, very rapacious commercial activity.  What are the main problems with these companies today?  Schor: They have not delivered on those promised benefits. On the economic side, platforms are not delivering decent wages and working conditions. Not only are the companies keeping wages low, but the chronic excess supply of workers also drives wages down. This is hard on what we call dependent earners \u2014 people who depend on this for a living rather than just supplementing their income. We found that it\u2019s very difficult, if not impossible, to make a living from these platforms. In addition, the platforms shift much of the risk from the companies to the workers, who are classified as independent contractors rather than employees.   On the social side, as these platforms grew, they became more like conventional businesses. When ride-hailing debuted, passengers sat in the front and talked with drivers. By 2019, Uber put a button on its app that allowed users to choose \u201cquiet mode,\u201d basically saying, \u201cShut up and drive.\u201d   In terms of the environment, instead of reducing carbon emissions, ride-hail has led to more vehicles on the road, more congestion, and people shunning public transportation. Airbnb, by making lodging so much cheaper, has induced more travel.  What impact has the pandemic had on this situation?  Schor: First, the pandemic has drastically altered demand. The two biggest platforms \u2014 Uber and Airbnb \u2014 have seen demand collapse. Uber has moved into delivery with Uber Eats, and others are moving into delivery as online shopping and grocery delivery has ramped up. At first there was a lot of contention around safety issues, like providing personal protective equipment and sick pay. But all of the companies pretty much have moved to provide these things.   Second, because of the rise in unemployment, more people are starting to work for the platforms. That\u2019s creating excess supply, so it\u2019s gotten much harder for people to get assignments. In ride-hail, they are spending much, much more time in an empty car because the demand isn\u2019t there. Drivers have started using bots to snag shifts.  So workers are getting sophisticated in trying to fight technology with technology?  Schor: Yes. Researchers have been uncovering various ways in which workers are trying to manipulate the algorithm. They use multiple phones, for example. Delivery people enter inaccurate information in order to affect the kinds of tasks they get assigned. If they don\u2019t want to deliver really heavy packages, they say they are on a bike, for example. They can fiddle around and change information to get the kinds of assignments they want.   On the other hand, remember that these algorithms learn fast. So as the workers develop strategies, the algorithms will always be changing. It\u2019s a highly accelerated cat-and-mouse game.  What solutions do you propose to \u201cwin back\u201d the sharing economy?  Schor: First is regulation. Governments are already starting to regulate these services, which could make working for the platforms a more viable full-time option. California\u2019s new law, [Assembly Bill] 5, sets new standards for employee classification that mean many gig workers will be classified as employees and therefore be eligible for minimum wage and other benefits. There are a number of similar laws proposed around the country. In July, Massachusetts\u2019s attorney general sued Lyft and Uber , alleging they misclassified drivers as independent contractors. And the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission has set a minimum wage for ride-hail drivers.   However, the platform companies have been really successful in lobbying, particularly at the state level, making it difficult to regulate them. Many states have passed what are called preemption laws, both in ride-hail and in short-term lodging, which make it illegal for cities to enact the kind of regulation that they want to.   But we see a second, more innovative scenario emerging: platform cooperatives. These cooperatives are owned by their users, by which I mean the workers who are earning on the platforms. My team has produced what we believe is the first academic study of a platform cooperative: Stocksy, a group of more than 1,000 photographers who do stock photography. They own and govern the platform themselves, which takes away most of the problems associated with labor issues. We\u2019re starting to see platform co-ops in house cleaning, driving, health care, translation, food delivery, and bicycle courier. It\u2019s an exciting new development that allows workers to have much more control over work conditions, thereby getting back to that original hope of what the sharing economy could do.   The co-ops use algorithms just like the platform companies, and so they get the same efficiency and transaction savings associated with digital technology. The algorithms wipe out whole levels of management. But in co-ops, the workers have control over those algorithms and how things are done.  Can you give us some examples of how algorithms can eliminate management?  Schor: Think about human resources. There are almost no human resources in these platform companies, at least for those working via the platform. The application process is automated. The platform offers videos to watch for training. And the \u201cperformance evaluation\u201d is done by consumers through ratings. In addition, there are no supervisors. American corporations typically have many supervisory levels. But there are no supervisors on the platforms \u2014 the algorithm tells you where to go, what to do, and if you don\u2019t do it, the algorithm knows. So the platform company just eliminated huge swaths of the modern corporation.  Stocksy is for selling goods \u2014 photos. And the other platforms you discuss in the book typically have a low barrier of entry for workers. What about platforms for freelance workers who offer highly skilled services?  Schor: There is a really interesting platform co-op in Europe, called Smart , for all sorts of freelancers. That\u2019s a relevant model. People set their own prices but share benefits, management, payment collection, etc.  Looking ahead, what\u2019s the likelihood that we will see a real sharing economy with equitable platforms for workers?  Schor: I tend to be an optimist. I think we\u2019ll see growth in the co-op platforms. The real question is whether they get big enough to challenge the larger players.   And it\u2019s worth reiterating that the collapse in demand due to COVID-19 has put the large players in a very precarious position. That may make it easier for alternatives to flower as markets pick up. I think platforms will go in the direction that the country goes. If there are serious moves to regulate big tech, if the country moves toward more equity and fairness and away from extreme inequality in society, that bodes very well for equitable platforms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42990640997</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RS-FP81-F07F-851P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Global Advisors</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

This year's lineup includes talks with YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, Facebook executives Adam Mosseri and Andrew Bosworth, Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy, Fair Fight founder Stacey Abrams, Netflix vice president of original content Cindy Holland, Russian Doll star Natasha Lyonne, and Medium CEO Ev Williams, to name a few. There is still one day to go, but so far, one trend seems to come through and that is that much of tech is still in denial about the issues tech and society are facing.The Relationship Between Tech Companies and Government Sure Is ComplicatedThe past few months have seen the relationship between government and tech giants become much more complicated than it has ever been. From the call to breaking up Amazon, Google and Facebook, to antitrust probes and calls for regulations on AI, facial recognition, and more. </p><p>At Recode's Code Conference speakers touched on all of these. Instagram's Adam Mosseri said that while splitting up Facebook and Instagram might make his life easier it is a terrible idea because splitting up the companies would make it exponentially more difficult to keep people safe especially for Instagram. He went on to say that more people are working on integrity and safety issues at Facebook than anybody who works at Instagram. This is not the first time the argument that size matters has been made. It seems disingenuous, though, not to point out that size matters also as a negative point. It is, in fact, the size and the reach Facebook has that makes it such an important platform to target for bad actors from election manipulation to hate speech. One could argue that a smaller company, while more limited in resources, would also limit the appeal. AWS CEO Andy Jassy said he'd like to see federal regulation on how facial recognition technology should and should not be used. His eagerness, however, was coming from a concern that otherwise we would see 50 different laws in 50 different states. He also stated: 'I strongly believe that just because the technology could be misused, doesn't mean we should ban it and condemn it.' Amazon, as well as Salesforce and Microsoft, all faced employees' criticism on their involvement in providing technologies to ICE and the US Custom and Border Protection Agency. At Code Con, immigrant advocacy organization RAICES accused tech companies of supporting Trump's administration No Tolerance stand on immigration by making their technologies available to the agencies.Facebook to Reveal New Portal DevicesTalking about being in denial. Andrew 'Boz' Bosworth, Facebook's vice president of AR/VR, told The Verge's Casey Newton that the company has 'lot more that we're going to unveil later in this fall,' related to Portal, including 'new form factors that we're going to be shipping.' While no sales numbers were provided during the interview, Bosworth said that Portal's sales were 'very good.' It is still unclear to me how Portal can be a long-term success for Facebook. The smart camera and smart sound that follow the subjects were probably the most significant appeal for Portal. Alexa built in added to the draw for those users who might have liked the technology but were not that keen at letting Facebook in their home. I do wonder how long it will take both Amazon and Google to add similar technology to their screen-based devices and the impact that this will have on Facebook's hardware. Both Amazon and Google scored better than Facebook did in our privacy and trust study signaling that consumers will have a higher propensity to let those brands in their home before they let Facebook in. I am also not convinced that Facebook's focus on human connection transfers from messenger to Portal. The kind of personal exchange that Portal is focusing on does not involve the same type of people we tend to engage with on Facebook Messenger. According to Similarweb.com in 2018, Facebook Messenger had the second largest audience following WhatsApp. While heavily skewed to North American Facebook Messenger counted 1.3 billion users worldwide. Messenger proved to be a very effective marketing channel, which means that many of those interactions are between consumers and a brand or consumers and a bot. While I understand how Portal offers the opportunity to create a more meaningful connection with users, I feel that Facebook is underestimating how much more cautious and irrational people become when we talk about privacy in the home. Ultimately, I do not see Facebook being able to deliver a differentiated smart home, assistant, or video chat service that will drive consumers to invest in their ecosystem over that of Amazon or Google.We Are Trying Our Best, We Are Very SorryAt the end of day one, Kara Swisher was asked if there was a thread transpiring from the interviews and she answered everybody was saying: 'We are trying our best, we are very sorry.' It is hard to take the act of contrition on display as genuine when so much is at stake with tech at the moment. YouTube's CEO Susan Wojcicki was asked by Ina Fried, the chief technology correspondent at Axios: 'I'm curious, are you really sorry for anything to the LGBTQ+ community, or are you just sorry that they were offended?' the almost 3 minutes long string of words which started with 'I am really personally very sorry' was a non-answer to a straightforward question. Wojcicki pointed to overall improvements to hate speech that will benefit the LGBTQ+ community but really did not explain any of the thought processes behind the decision. Unfortunately, Wojcicki is not alone when it comes to the leadership of tech giants lacking accountability and transparency. Some commentators say these issues are not black and white, which is true, but that should not stop us from trying to resolve them. It seems to me that most tech companies are not even willing to admit there is an issue, which will make it impossible to find a solution. Wojcicki, for instance, was not even ready to acknowledge that social media platforms contribute to radicalization. In a refreshing twist of events, Twitter seemed more in touch with reality as top legal counsel Vijaya Gadde said: 'I think that there is content on Twitter and every [social media] platform that contributes to radicalization, no doubt.'  I am an optimist, and I like to see the good in tech. I certainly don't want to fix something that is not broken, and I worry about government intervention because of the lack of understanding of the world we leave in and the need to put their political agenda before us. That said, with the changes that technologies such as AI, ML, and 5G are bringing, it is time for big tech to step up their accountability, transparency, and ethics game.

Check out the attached slideshow to see photos from the Milwaukee Jewish Federation's 2018 Economic Forum.</p><p>A sold-out crowd of more than 650 Milwaukee-area business executives attended the popular event at The Pfister Hotel.</p><p>Swisher, who is also host of the Recode Decode podcast and co-executive producer of the Code Conference, is known as being very outspoken on technology issues. She calls herself the \"grumpy lady of tech\" on her Twitter page.</p><p>\"More regulation is probably coming,\" she said. \"We need to be careful that it doesn't put big tech companies at advantage and small start ups at disadvantage.\"</p><p>Swisher said technology advances are coming at a breakneck pace.</p><p>\"If you think you've seen a lot in the past 20 years, you have not seen anything yet,\" she said. \"Open mindedness is critical to innovation, closed mindedness is the death of innovation.\"</p><p>After Swisher's remarks, a panel discussion including\u00a0Mike Gousha\u00a0of Marquette University Law School, Dr. Nick Turkal of Advocate Aurora Health and Joe Kirgues of gener8tor reacted to the presentation and talked about the challenges facing the Milwaukee area.</p><p>\"Locals need to invest in locals. I can't think of a better strategy for growth in the next five years,\" Kirgues said. \"There's a real anxiety about if tomorrow will be better than today. We need to invest in our best and brightest. It's a moral and business issue.\"</p><p>Turkal said the region lacked the urgency as a state to focus on startups.</p><p>\"We need to change the dialogue and narrative,\" Turkal said. \"We are dead last. We need to close the gap over the next two years. We need someone to lead the charge.\"</p><p>The event was co-chaired by Linda Gorens-Levey of General Capital Group, David Lubar of Lubar &amp; Co., Greg Marcus of The Marcus Corp. and Major League Baseball commissioner emeritus Bud Selig.</p><p>Milwaukee-area business executives in attendance included Milwaukee financial executive\u00a0Shel Lubar,\u00a0Patty Cadorin\u00a0of BMO Harris Bank, \u00a0Mark Shapiro\u00a0of the Jewish Community Center, Teddy Werner of the Milwaukee Brewers, Chris Goller of PNC Bank, Cecelia Gore of the Milwaukee Brewers Community Foundation and Steve Marcus of The Marcus Corp.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

We've got a big show this morning. Joining the conversation, Moody's Capital Markets chief economist John Lonski is here. Fox Business' Dagen McDowell is here. And Turning Point USA spokesperson, Iraq War veteran, Rob Smith.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>ROB SMITH, SPOKESPERSON, TURNING POINT USA: Great to be here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have so much on the docket this morning.</p><p>SMITH: So much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Our top story, it is job's day in America this morning. The December job's report is expected just about -- in two and a half hours' time after 8:00 a.m. Eastern this morning. Estimates show 164,000 jobs were added to the economy in the month of December of the last month of 2019 with an unemployment rate holding steady at a 50-year low of 3.5 percent. Markets this morning are up ahead of the report. Take a look. Dow Industrials up 54 points, the S&amp;P futures are up 7.25 and the Nasdaq up 32 points.</p><p>John Lonski, we are expecting a slowdown from the robust growth we saw earlier in the year and certainly in 2018.</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: Nevertheless, I think this job's report is going to be good enough so that we're going to have new record highs at the close of the equity market today. It will probably conform to expectations. We're going to see, you know, further growth by wages, but not at such a rate of growth that we begin to worry about inflation.</p><p>I'm looking for good news on the employment front and the Dow closing above 29,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the expansion continues now in year 11, huh?</p><p>LONSKI: Why not? Why not have it continue?</p><p>And let's not forget, you know, in Australia, believe it or not, they have not had a recession, I believe, in 28 years. So we're only in the eleventh year. We have a ways to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>LONSKI: We can't let the guys down under beat us.</p><p>SMITH: You know, we have so much longer to go. And I think that it's so nice to see America winning again. There are literally more than 7 million job openings right now. There are more job openings than there are people looking for jobs. That is a good thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love the -- what's happening with women. This is something to watch out for. The number of jobs held by women in this country, not counting self-employed or farmers, could surpass the number of men in December. So we've seen a shrinking of that gender gap. It's narrowed in recent years. But the unemployment rate at a 50 year low. It's expected to stick there.</p><p>One number to watch out for, because I'm a huge nerd, if employers don't add at least 98,000 jobs last month, then 2019 would be the lowest year for job growth since 2010. So it would be the lowest of --</p><p>LONSKI: But --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Of the last ten years.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes, you have to go ahead and expect jobs growth slow as the unemployment rate moves lower --</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: For the simple fact that you're beginning to run out of qualified workers to hire. So there's no escaping that fact. And I think nowadays, because of slower labor force growth, it takes job growth of only 75,000 to 100,000 to prevent the unemployment rate from rising, and that's what you want to avoid.</p><p>SMITH: And when you look at those unemployment rate numbers, you talked about the amount of women working right now, we have record lows for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, veterans --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: People with disabilities, people without a high school diploma. This is just such a really good time and a really strong time for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to find out where the high-paying jobs are.</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where the wages are actually the strongest and what's going on in terms of income inequality, which we've talked about so much this morning (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. The Atlanta Fed, we talked about this. I don't even know if it came up in the air. But even the Atlanta Federal Reserve came out with a study over the holidays that proves that ranking and file workers, their wages are growing much faster than the -- say the top 10 percent, even top 25 percent, that their wage gains are outpacing even the broad number and how much people in the kind of top tier income scales are earning. So that in and of itself is closing income inequality.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think it's 4.5 percent is what the Atlanta Fed reported - -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That the bottom earners saw their wages go up 4.5 percent versus an average of 3.1 percent nationally.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's the fastest in a decade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Their wages, the rank and file workers, their wages are growing the fastest in 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big stuff.</p><p>SMITH: So that pokes a whole in the idea of the left that says that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SMITH: You know, these people are not making money, which they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. That's right.</p><p>LONSKI: And somebody from the left is going to add in that maybe it's the minimum wage hikes that's responsible for the faster wage growth --</p><p>SMITH: Oh, I --</p><p>LONSKI: You see at the bottom end of the income distribution.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: I don't know if that's right, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: There is news this morning on Boeing we've got to talk about. Troubling news. The company releasing internal documents showing that employees discussed and put off potential safety consideration with the 737 Max aircraft. One employee wrote in the e-mail, quote, would you put your family on a Max simulated aircraft. And he said, I wouldn't. The comment just one of several troubling statements this morning. It's right there in black and white, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is. What I would point out, there was one quote that jumped out, and this was the chief technical pilot Mark Forkner for the 737 Max. These were messages that were released earlier, said, quote, Jedi mind tricking regulators and said he had knowingly lied to the FAA.</p><p>This is one of the reasons that Denise Mueilenberg was kicked -- shown the door, so to speak, as the CEO, that they needed to replace him because of the deteriorating relationship with the FAA and Federal Aviation regulators because that is the linchpin in getting this plane back in the skies.</p><p>SMITH: And they had some of the pilots that were actually -- they felt bad about things that they had done before. One of these pilots told a fellow employee, he said, quote, I so haven't been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year. Can't do it one more time. Pearly gates will be closed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>SMITH: That makes me very, very afraid as somebody who travels and flies a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is cringe worthy actually.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then the Iran plane story, another story. This was a Boeing plane. This wasn't the 737 Max. But Iran is reportedly inviting Boeing to help investigate this week's deadly Ukraine International Airways crash. It killed all 176 people on board. Now, Iran is denying shooting down the passenger jet after the U.S. has said that intelligence support that the plane was shot down but shot down by accident.</p><p>SMITH: Look, you know, and there's intelligence from Canada, from a lot of different people that say that that plane was shot down by Iran. And what's going on right now is that a lot of these passengers were Iranians, right? So about 176 of these people were killed. And so this has just been a very, very, very bad week for Iran.</p><p>So we have these people killed in this plane that they shot down. They have the people killed during the stampede during the Soleimani memorial.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. Yes, the stampede.</p><p>SMITH: So it's just been a really, really bad week for Iran. And they're starting to say that Iran wants to do their own internal investigation for one the two years. Isn't that convenient. So the heat is going to die down in one or two years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They don't want to give up the black box.</p><p>SMITH: Now, they don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: They don't.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But to Rob's point, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- again, 63 Canadians at least were killed in this plane crash -- Justin Trudeau and the prime minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, both said they believe that this plane was shot down by an Iranian surface to air missile system. This may have well been unintentional, but I want answers said Justin Trudeau.</p><p>So this isn't just U.S. officials suggesting this.</p><p>But the response from some people on social media -- Pete Buttigieg said, innocent civilians are now dead because they were caught in the middle of an unnecessary and unwanted military tit for tat.</p><p>What is he talking about? This is Iran. This is Iran, accidental or not, taking down a commercial jetliner with people on board. And there was a --</p><p>SMITH: And Buttigieg --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And in there was another commentator on one of these other networks who called it crossfire. You know what, you even have a dictionary online now. Look up the word \"crossfire\" and see if that applies to Iran shooting a commercial airliner out of the air. Crossfire. There was no other fire other than that from Iran.</p><p>SMITH: Number one, Buttigieg is a veteran, so he should know better. Number two, the left is engaged --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a pretty good point.</p><p>SMITH: The left is engaged in this fiction, right, that we were the aggressors of this entire situation. That is not true. Iran were the aggressor of this entire generation -- excuse me, this entire situation. The American soldiers were killed. The U.S. embassy was attacked. One American contractor was killed. So they started all of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>Somebody said to me the other day, they said, it seems to -- this is the chit chat.</p><p>This seemed to come out of nowhere. And I said, no --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you watch Fox News --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nowhere?</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you watch Fox News, if you read \"The Wall Street Journal,\" you would know that this aggression from Iran was picking up momentum. We didn't respond after the American drone was shot out of the air. We didn't respond when the Saudi Arabian, an ally of ours, an oil field -- their main oil field was attacked. So there was restraint and restraint until -- that we would not stand by and watch more Americans die at the hands of a terrorist regime.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We responded when an American was killed is when we responded.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, President Trump held a rally last night in Ohio. This is his first of 2020. He spoke about the U.S. killing Iranian General Soleimani. He slammed Democrats over why he did not brief them ahead of the strike.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now, Schiff is a big leaker. You know, he leads to crazy CNN. So he'll say, you know, off the record, I've got to hurry up because everyone's watching me it the hallway on my cell phone. Off the record, they've got the number one terrorist in the world, Soleimani, and they're going to get him. They're going to take him out in the next 10 minutes.</p><p>So we have -- we have breaking news. President Trump, within the next 20, 25 minutes, looks to be taking out terrorist General Soleimani.</p><p>They want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, this is one of the implications when you've got both sides not trusting each other at all. I mean they're not going to share information. How -- why would President Trump tell Nancy Pelosi or any of the Democrats the plans when, in fact, he doesn't trust that they're actually going to share it with anybody and leak it?</p><p>LONSKI: It's a very sad state of affairs in Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very sad.</p><p>LONSKI: You have this break in trust.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: How can you come up with any type of legislation that's going to move this country forward. It's so sad. Everything's become so political. You were talking about Mayor Pete's comments to this downing of the Ukrainian airline. That's just one example where politics seems to take precedence over what is good for the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right. All right, we'll take a short break. We are just getting started this morning. We've got a lot coming up. A jam-packed news morning once again.</p><p>There is the impeachment showdown to discuss. The House is still holding onto the articles of impeachment. No word on when they will actually move on to the Senate.</p><p>And then the royal exit. The fallout over Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to step back from royal duties. That includes council from a very famous voice. Wait till you hear this.</p><p>And then we are watching your wallet this morning. Tips on how to get your credit score back up for 2020 and beyond.</p><p>Stay with us. We've got a lot coming up.</p><p>But first, caught on camera. The crazy moment a runaway driver attempts to bail out of her speeding -- of his speeding car. Don't miss that coming up.</p><p>And then new year new Zuckerberg. The FaceBook chief doing away with his annual New Year's challenge, he says.</p><p>We're back right after this break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A startling disclosure in the case of Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Let's get to Cheryl Casone. She's got headlines.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: That's right, Maria, federal prosecutors say that security footage of Jeffrey Epstein's first suicide attempt behind bars was accidentally deleted. They go on to say the New York jail where Epstein was being held saved video from the wrong floor on the July night that the billionaire was found with a bed sheet around his neck. Now, the correct video has since been erased. Epstein, who was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, was found dead in his cell less than a month later.</p><p>GrubHub setting the record straight. The company pushing back against reports that it's up for sale. That report sending shares surging up 12.5 percent yesterday. Walmart, Albertsons and Stop and Shop were reported to be potential buyers. But with the denial, the stock is now substantially down in the pre-market. It's down almost 8 percent.</p><p>And then there's this. Mark Zuckerberg is saying good-bye to his annual challenge for the new year. Instead, the FaceBook CEO says he now wants to take a longer-term focus on the decade. Some of those plans includes creating a new private social platform. His past personal goals saw him reading books a month, learning Mandarin, Dagen's favorite, when he wanted to travel to every state in the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE). We thought he was running for president when he kept traveling all over the place.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to know what -- I -- I want to know what Mark Zuckerberg's goals are every year. Again, because if he's travel to every state when he did that, I think that some of the Democrats in Washington ought to do that. Some of the -- the candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination ought to do that. You know who's doing it is Mike Bloomberg. He's starting to talk about the wage gap and the skills gap in rural America. So I think that will be really interesting. Let's put together a list on what Mark Zuckerberg should focus on. He's got his hands full.</p><p>SMITH: I mean, I think he's just going to focus on paying more lobbyists in D.C. so that people don't talk about breaking up FaceBook.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they've got -- they got caught flat-footed because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win and the tech companies were totally in the pocket of the Democrats.</p><p>SMITH: Of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They sure did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And when she didn't win they were -- Google, for one, was scrambling to higher lobbyists like Trump whisperers. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you remember -- do you remember at the Democratic Convention, we were there together in 2016, and Eric Schmitt (ph) was walking around in Philadelphia at the Democratic Convention and he had a tag on that said \"staff.\" DNC staff. He had -- I remember, that picture was all over.</p><p>All right.</p><p>LONSKI: Oh, boy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Elvis -- Elvis no more, Eric Schmitt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>A quick break and then a hero's welcome. The American firefighters greeted with cheers as they arrive to help fight the raging Australia wildfires. Wait till you see the reaction when they were in the Australian airport. It was just great.</p><p>And then, jobs in America this morning. Taco Bell is having such a hard time finding workers, it is now offering six-figure salaries, yes, at Taco Bell.</p><p>Plus royal rift. The fallout after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle decide to step back from their royal duties, all coming up right here.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Another record day on Wall Street yesterday. And check out today. We are, once again, in uncharted territory. Futures pointing up. The Dow nearly reaching 29,000 for the first time ever. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq also closing at record highs. As you see, the Dow Industrials right now up 70 points, a quarter of a percent. The S&amp;P's up nine and the Nasdaq is up 39 this morning, almost half a percent there as well.</p><p>Joining us right now, Federated Investors senior equity analyst Linda Duessel.</p><p>And, Linda, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>LINDA DUESSEL, SENIOR EQUITY STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Would you put new money to work in this market today given these record highs and given this move that we've seen over the last year?</p><p>DUESSEL: Well, yes, I would. And I mean we, at Federated Investors, have a 3,500 (ph) yearend target on the market. People do ask all the time, should I buy now even though we're at record highs. We're at record highs because earnings are at record highs. We look at relative valuation. The stock market looks reasonably prices, particularly versus whatever else you might buy. And if I don't see a recession, I can put my money to work, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, we've got a good backdrop and we've got the job's report coming out this morning. The latest estimates show that 164,000 jobs were added to the economy last month. The unemployment rate sticking to its 50 year low of 3.5 percent.</p><p>We are also looking at wage growth for the past month. Taco Bell is leading the charge. Apparently restaurant managers are making up to $100,000 a year, up from $50,000 to $80,000.</p><p>So, Linda, with wages rising, what's your take in terms of the inflation story? Do you think that we are going to see continuation of these wages picking up?</p><p>DUESSEL: Well, I think this is a reflection of the tight job market that's out there. And, gosh, it seems like you died and went to heaven if you could get Taco Bell and make a really serious dollar, doesn't it.</p><p>But it -- but just in general, what we have seen in our work on wages is that the best wage growth has come from the bottom core tile of the income strata, and that is good news because these people will spend the money that they make. But the top (INAUDIBLE) really hasn't seen that much of an increase. So wage growth is going -- is definitely happening, but it's been very well under control. And, of course, this is what we're all watching. (INAUDIBLE) worry about something, let's worry about inflation and wages is a good place to look.</p><p>LONSKI: Hi, Linda, John Lonski.</p><p>I'm a little bit troubled by the fact that, well, equity analysts are calling for a faster profit's growth in 2020. Economists, for the most part, are predicting slower economic growth along with perhaps somewhat faster labor cost growth.</p><p>How do you square this? How do we get a measurable, material acceleration of profits, while at the same time the economy is expected to slow?</p><p>DUESSEL: Well, we -- we don't believe that the economy is going to slow this year. We have a 2.4 percent GDP growth estimate. And I think the important thing is that all around the world last year you saw lots of interest rate cuts. It takes about a year or two for those to make --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There we go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Looks like we lost Linda's mic. We're going to get that back.</p><p>You know, I thought there was an interesting story in \"The Journal\" this morning about these money-losing companies skyrocketing. You know, they looked at GE and then they looked at Tesla as well in terms of stocks and how they're up in the last year and yet some of these companies that we're talking about in terms of the big rallies are not making any money. So you have to wonder, in terms of the backdrop and whether or not this is sustainable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is the future versus the past of a company that's struggling versus a game-changer.</p><p>Maybe -- and I still think some of the stock price, some of the loft (ph) in Tesla is people -- are people betting that Tesla will eventually get acquired by somebody else, maybe I've -- maybe an Apple if it doesn't buy Netflix.</p><p>LONSKI: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm throwing that out there. That's total speculation.</p><p>LONSKI: Well, Tesla is all about technology, expertise in this particular area. You know, they're all by them -- they're ahead of everybody else. And that's where their value lies.</p><p>You know what, I keep -- I'm -- also want to bring into play that we've had a deterioration of credit quality. Last year we had only almost two times as many downgrades as upgrades for high yield credit rating revisions. That's troubling. And that -- you know, I -- the warning there is that we could run into some problems in the financial markets if this recovery by profits does not materialize. Quite frankly, S&amp;P 500 earnings per share were just flat overall in 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But do you think the momentum continues? Do you think this market keeps going up given the backdrop?</p><p>LONSKI: I think it has a chance of going up. It's not going to go up as it did last year by 25, 30 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: I think in 2020 maybe the gain's going to be 5 percent with a great deal of volatile.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: I would have a difficult time recommending to somebody to significantly increase their exposure to equities given how richly valued the market is right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Understood.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But in terms of the credit -- the credit worthiness of American individuals, consumer free cash flow is at a record high in terms of you -- the individuals having very robust balance sheets, so to speak.</p><p>LONSKI: Well, you bring up a good point. We've got to keep our eye on what's going on with credit sensitive housing. We hope that that does better in 2020. If that does, that's going to be a very positive sign and that could mean all these economists are wrong, that we're going to be growing at a rate well above 2 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And -- and --</p><p>LONSKI: Also, look at auto sales. They've been slumping over the past couple of years. Will they stage a rebound?</p><p>If home sales climbed by more than 5 percent, if auto sales steady, then I think we -- we're going to be in for a better than expected year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: My pops bought a brand new car over the holidays.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A Ford. We went into Mercedes-Benz and they couldn't sell -- they couldn't sell a southerner lima beans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So he walked right and over to Ford.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And so we walked out. Thanks, Mercedes-Benz, and we went right to Ford. Bought a Ford Explorer coming off the line, 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is great.</p><p>We'll see what the corporate sector says next week and the next couple of weeks because the fourth quarter earnings season is going to begin next week with the major banks reporting their fourth quarter next week. That is what's going to drive the markets in the coming several weeks.</p><p>All right, we want to take a break.</p><p>When we come back, caught on camera. The crazy moment a runway driver attempts to escape his speeding car. You don't want to miss this. Stay with us on that.</p><p>And then, the lifestyle brand people love to hate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you guys ready to go out in the field and make a ruckus?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just another day at the office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand ready to take on the high seas. We've got that coming up.</p><p>And also coming up next week, here's what's on tap for MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>Monday, China's ready to sign on the dotted line. Former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders with the inside scoop.</p><p>Tuesday we are live in San Francisco with the biggest banker in the nation, Jamie Dimon is here.</p><p>Wednesday, big tech bracing for big regulations, but stocks continue to soar. We are watching your wallet.</p><p>Thursday, increasing Iranian saber rattling, bringing the U.S. to the brink of war. Senator James Lankford on the path forward.</p><p>And Friday, it is time to \"Ask Maria,\" I'm answering the questions that matter to you.</p><p>That's all right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A wild ride all caught on camera in Michigan.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria, check out this footage. It was caught on a police dash cam. Troopers attempting to pull the driver over -- seen circled -- over for speeding on Interstate 94. Well, instead, the guy opens the car door, tries to escape, wheels still turning. The car crashes into a median. The driver escapes. He's running through traffic. The guy was eventually arrested, but the video, unbelievable. And we're sharing it with you this morning.</p><p>All right now to Australia. Officials there are urging nearly a quarter of a million people to leave their homes as wildfires continue to scorch the country. Wind conditions threaten to make matters worse, despite some much needed rainfall. Some of the local wildlife is getting some help from man's best friend, specifically trained dogs are now going out to help rescue koalas. The dogs sniff out koala fur so handlers can move in and save these animals.</p><p>And one video from Sidney National Airport has gone viral. Watch.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Cheers. Nothing but cheers. These are American firefighters that just arrived at Sidney International Airport, and that was the reception that they got. Obviously they are there to help Australian officials fight those deadly fires.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Love that video.</p><p>CASONE: I love that video. Best part of my day today.</p><p>All right, finally, one more story.</p><p>A California judge is handing a break to independent truck drivers. The judge has ruled the truckers are exempt from the state's new gig economy law because it conflicts with a federal law. The measure is aimed at reducing labor abuses by requiring companies to treat independent contractors as employees. Well, the city of Los Angeles is telling Fox Business, guys, it's going to actually appeal this decision.</p><p>Those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, I want to turn to the deadly plane crash near Tehran. Iran is denying claims that a missile hit the doomed Ukrainian jet. The Pentagon has said that it is highly likely an errant missile from Iran shot the plane down shortly after takeoff, killing all 176 people on board. The crash happening after Iran's retaliatory attack against U.S. military bases in Iraq on Tuesday and the U.S. took down key Iranian General Qasem Soleimani during that air strike last week.</p><p>President Trump dismissed Iran's initial claim a mechanical problem caused the crash. He weighed in on the death of Soleimani during a rally last night in Ohio.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Last week the United States once again took the bold and decisive action to save American lives and deliver American justice. And you know what I'm talking about.</p><p>For years, the sadistic mass murderer Qasem Soleimani planned and executed attacks against American targets, killing and wounding thousands of U.S. service members and many, many thousands and even hundreds of thousands of other people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the former commander of the USS Cole, Kirk Lippold.</p><p>And, Commander, it's good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>KIRK LIPPOLD, FORMER USS COLE COMMANDER: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to this situation. Iran is now denying that it had anything to do with it. Was it an accident? What do you think?</p><p>LIPPOLD: Well, shock, Maria, the Iranians actually lying. When you look at it, a Russian missile system, and they denied it in MH-17 with Malaysia Air. Iran buys a same system and now they're denying it. I'm not surprised.</p><p>The intelligence that we have on this is absolutely rock solid. The United States is giving the Iranians an opportunity to come clean and admit that it was a mistake. They have yet to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I -- they don't want to hand over the black boxes either. Iran so far refusing to hand over those black boxes.</p><p>So what is the international response going to be? What should it be?</p><p>LIPPOLD: Well, I think right now what the United States did, as soon as we got the intelligence, which initially was the radar was turned on, obviously tracking the airplane, we caught the plume as the missile left the launcher, we saw it impact right up the back of the right side engine, which then exploded, peppered shrapnel on the starboard side or right side of the aircraft. The wing was lost, which would cause lift, which is why you get that turn over to the right where it crashed after falling apart in midair.</p><p>The international community is going to learn more and more as time goes on. The Canadians have the full picture. They're trying to also give the Iranians an opportunity to come clean on this. They want to do this investigation. At the end of the day, the investigation into this crash, just like the Malaysian air crash with the Russians is going to prove that Iran shut down this airplane.</p><p>SMITH: Hey, Commander, Rob Smith here.</p><p>I'm curious to get your thoughts on the Canadian responses to this entire situation. Do you think that it was forceful and strong enough, or do you think that they handled it just right?</p><p>LIPPOLD: I think right now they're handling it just right. They want to still maintain some relationship with the Iranian government that clearly we don't have. Obviously, over 60 of their citizens were tragically killed in this crash. They want to give time and space. But I think as time goes on, the Canadian government is going to become more forceful with the Iranians, knowing the intelligence that's backing up that they fired and killed their people and they're going to demand accountability for this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Commander, it's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Rather than blaming Iran, be it a mistake or not, for the downing of this commercial airliner, we have people on the left, prominent Democrats, essentially laying the blame on President Trump.</p><p>Congresswoman Jackie Speier said on CNN yesterday that the Ukraine plane crash in Iran was, quote, collateral damage from Trump's provocative actions.</p><p>I actually had to go and watch that video because I thought it was too ridiculous for someone in Congress to say that, but indeed she did.</p><p>LIPPOLD: These people are proving that they are totally clueless when it comes to the deaths of Americans at the hands of Iranian government. At the end of the day, the statements that they and others are making in that regard with respect to Soleimani and the aftermath is frankly un-American. It's really tragic that we send these young men and women forward to serve our nation and they die at the hands of Iranians and all they want to do is give them a final paycheck and a folded flag, wash their hands of it and walk away.</p><p>These families deserve to know that we, as Americans, that we as a nation are going to go after those that kill our service members and hold them accountable, and that's exactly what we should be doing in this case.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LIPPOLD: Iran was held accountable. The line has been drawn. Now we need to hold it for the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you were the commanding officer of the USS Cole when it came under a suicide terrorist attack by al Qaeda in Yemen, Commander. That had to be an incredible experience for you.</p><p>Thank you for your service, sir.</p><p>LIPPOLD: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will see you soon.</p><p>Kirk S. Lippold joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, impeachment showdown. The House still holding onto the articles of impeachment with no word on when they will actually move on to the Senate.</p><p>Plus, the lifestyle brand Dagen loves to hate. Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop. She's taking to the high seas and it's making a buzz this morning. We've got it for you coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>House lawmakers passing a war power's resolution yesterday aimed at limiting President Trump's use of military force in Iran. The vote, 224 to 194 with eight Democrats voting against it, but three Republicans voted for it. Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz was amongst them, one of the GOP members backing the war powers resolutions.</p><p>He explains why. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I think this war power's resolution was worthy of support because it did not criticize the president, it did not say he was wrong of killing Soleimani, but he did -- it did say that if any president wants to drag our nation into another forever Middle East war that they require the approval of the United States Congress.</p><p>My belief that declaring war is a non-delegable duty of the United States Congress. And it's ludicrous for any of my colleagues to suggest that we have to not do our job so that people in uniform can do theirs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Texas Congressman, member of the House Rules and Energy and Commerce Committees Michael Burgess.</p><p>Congressman, it's always good to see you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX): Good morning, Maria. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How did you vote yesterday?</p><p>BURGESS: Well, I voted against the -- the concurrent resolution because actually it wasn't a war power's resolution, it was a resolution designed to damage the president. And I think that was pretty obvious. If you listen to the debate yesterday afternoon, that was entirely -- it was -- what was on the minds of the party that brought that resolution to the floor.</p><p>Look, we got that maybe 40 minutes before it was introduced in the Rules Committee the night before. There was very little chance to debate that in the Rules Committee. Many of us have felt for some time that, yes, Congress does need to reassert its authority with regards to the Authorization for Use of Military Force. There has not been a legitimate vote on an authorization like that since I came to Congress. Congress' -- the administrations have been operating under 2001 and 2002 authorizations.</p><p>Yes, I agree with Representative Gaetz in that regard. This is our obligation. This is something we should do. But the bill yesterday, the concurrent resolution yesterday, was not that. That was a bill that was designed to hurt the president.</p><p>And, look, we're at a place right now where we ought to be -- we ought to be -- we ought to be supportive of the things that are going on. The -- honestly, the death of General Soleimani is something that this country will look back on as a -- as a positive inflection point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because the rules are that he has to, the administration, the executive powers has to check with Congress if it's just beginning a war or invasion, but if you're responding to something, then the president should have the executive power. That's where it stands today.</p><p>BURGESS: Yes. And people with the doubt, Google the Baghdad embassy and look at the pictures of the internal --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BURGESS: The internal pictures of that embassy after that attack that this general orchestrated, this general was responsible for. Under the agreement with Iran under President Obama, this general was not supposed to leave Iran. What was he doing in Iraq in the first place?</p><p>Well, what he was doing was touching base with all of his cronies across the region and he was preparing to launch a much more major attack.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: Actionable intelligence was gathered and the opportunity to take him out occurred.</p><p>Look, I got -- when I got to Congress in the early 2000's, there was discussion about Bill Clinton having the ability to take out bin Laden in the late 1990s and he didn't do it. Well, then, when General Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, talks about how we would be culpably negligent if we didn't do this, it really became pretty clear.</p><p>But the point of the bill yesterday -- or the point of the concurrent resolution yesterday was to damage the president --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BURGESS: Look, this is really unfortunate. We've had impeachment. We've had this vote yesterday. All of the things we should be doing. Everything that the United States House of Representatives is doing right now under Democratic leadership is designed to harm the president. And that's just wrong. There are -- there are things we could do together. I know it's a political year. I know it's a presidential election year. But this sort of stuff, impeachment, and trying to damage the president when he's protecting the country, this just doesn't fly.</p><p>SMITH: Congressman, Rob Smith here.</p><p>BURGESS: Yes, Rob.</p><p>SMITH: I'm an Iraq War veteran myself. And, you know, we're going on 17 years of this war in Iraq and how would you respond to people who say that this resolution would help to stop a repeat of the situation that we were - - we have going on in Iraq?</p><p>And also, you just alluded of this idea of things that you guys can do together to sort of prevent that. And what would those ideas be?</p><p>BURGESS: Well, it's -- the -- a true Authorization for Use of Military Force would come through the Foreign Affairs Committee. It would -- there would be witnesses. There would be debate. There would be an opportunity for many members who aren't on the committee to weigh in.</p><p>The thing is that the action taken that was brought up to the House Rules Committee presumes that the president was going to launch an invasion into the country of Iran, which isn't true. When you look at the language of the concurrent resolution, it says that the invasion of -- or the activity in Iran must stop. Well, there is no activity in Iran right now. Soleimani was taken out, true, but that was in the country of Iraq, where he wasn't supposed to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: Look, 2011, the -- that President Obama removed all of the troops from Iraq, probably would have been the point at which to de-authorize that prior authorization. Is it correct to continue to use that? Well, we should have that debate as well. But you don't do that when you're in the middle - - when you're in the middle of actually protecting the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Congressman, one source yesterday told me that he thinks that she's going to send the articles of impeachment over to the Senate today. We'll see. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi obviously is sitting on this, holding off on sending those articles over to the Senate, now facing criticism from members of her own party. Despite the pushback, though, she's holding firm.</p><p>Watch this. Got to get your reaction.</p><p>BURGESS: Sure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP: NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): No, I'm not holding them indefinitely. I'll send them over when I'm ready. And that will probably be soon.</p><p>We want to see what they're willing to do and the manner in which they will do it. But we will not let them say, oh, this is just like Clinton, fair is fair. It's not. Documents, documentation, witnesses, facts, truth, that's what they're afraid of.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your reaction, Congressman?</p><p>BURGESS: You know, I honestly don't know what to say.</p><p>The speaker, at this point, has one job, and that job is to take those articles off the speaker's desk and take them over to the Senate and deliver them to the majority leader in the United States Senate. That's really not -- it's almost as if that's not a constitutional responsibility, that's a bookkeeping responsibility. It ought to happen and get -- the president needs a chance to acquit himself. The president needs a chance to defend himself. That trial will happen in the Senate. Let's get on with that.</p><p>It is not helping us. And you can see this. I mean the fallout from the vote that we took yesterday internationally I suspect could be significant. The fallout from the impeachment vote could be significant. Why are we hampering a president who's done more than any other president with which I've served? This has been -- yes, it's been an active administration. Yes, there's days that the road has been bumpy. But more has been accomplished in the last three years than the last 10 years. So this is a - - this is an important time for us. Let's get through this, acquit the president and then get on with business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's quite extraordinary.</p><p>Real quick, have you heard when she's going to send them over? Did you hear that rumor that it could be today?</p><p>BURGESS: Well, I've heard that rumor it could be today for several weeks now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>BURGESS: Yes, you would presume that she would want to bury it late on a Friday afternoon spin --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BURGESS: So it misses the news cycle. But then the news cycle, as you know, never stops --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BURGESS: Because you'll be on Sunday morning talking about it. So, there you are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. I sure will.</p><p>Congressman, thank you.</p><p>BURGESS: Great. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will be covering that on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" for sure.</p><p>Congressman Michael Burgess, it's good to see you, sir.</p><p>A quick break and then the royal exit making a buzz this morning. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle take advice from a very famous voice, apparently, as they step away from their royal duties. That's next, right here. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Well, Meghan and Harry making some real buzz this morning. More fallouts from the couple's decision to step away from the royal family. Their wax figures have been removed from the Madame Tussaud's royal family set in London. The museum tweeted out, it's got to respect Meghan and Harry's wishes. This as Harry has reportedly been in tense discussions with the queen, his brother William and their father, Prince Philip, and also Oprah playing life coach, apparently advising the couple about breaking free of the monarchy, Dagen. That's what they -- that's what we're hearing, but --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oprah Winfrey has denied it. She said -- told \"People\" magazine, Meghan and Harry do not need my help figuring out what's best for them. I care about them both and support whatever decisions they make for their family.</p><p>Clearly what's afoot here, Meghan and Harry want to be -- start a Kardashian-like clan here in North America and still have --</p><p>SMITH: Are we going to be keeping up with Megxit here?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And still -- and still -- and still have some association with the royal family.</p><p>For Meghan Markle, I will just point to Sarah Ferguson, that after she separated from the royal family, she was -- it wound up, years down the road, having to borrow money from a pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, that it's -- you don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'd be (INAUDIBLE) to go back to acting.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Don't have the spotlight of the royal family, then what does -- what's the spotlight --</p><p>SMITH: Yes. I agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She can't be an actress if she's part of the royal family, I guess.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, she can't be. I agree with you, I think she wants to go back to acting. And, look, Meghan Markle is no Sarah Ferguson, OK. I think that Meghan and Harry are both young. Meghan's gorgeous, Harry's kind of attractive. And I think that they want to go and they want to make a go of it in Hollywood.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: They want to be famous. They want to be lifestyle gurus. They, you know, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. I don't know if you could have it both ways.</p><p>SMITH: They're going to try.</p><p>LONSKI: But the real question is -- the real question is, what becomes of those wax versions of Meghan and Harry? That's what I want to know. Where do they end up?</p><p>BARTIROMO: How about this, Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand planning to set sail, but it will cost you. I'm talking about Goop, partnering with Celebrity Cruises, for a health-inspired Mediterranean cruise. Ticket packages begin at around $2,000 per person.</p><p>SMITH: Dig that out of the couch cushions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Goop, Dagen. Isn't this one of your favorite brands?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't like to use the word \"hate,\" but this might apply.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL: Never been a fan of the privileged Gwyneth Paltrow. And I would rather have all my toenails removed one by one than go on that cruise.</p><p>SMITH: I disagree, Dagen. I disagree because this is what I think. I think that you love to hate Gwyneth. I think that you're what we call a hater fan. I have hater fans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm not a hater fan.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I am not a fan.</p><p>SMITH: No, you love to hate her. Come on, that's called a hater fan. You love to hate her.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. I just -- no, I just -- I just hate -- I just hate -- again, I don't like people who come from wealth and act like they made it on their own when you were born into fame. Shut up!</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is job's Friday, everybody. We're getting the December's job report out in about an hour and a half. Back in two-minute's time with more on that. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020011001cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY8-2WG1-JB20-G0B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7621\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

A major problem is that online advertising practices are complex and secretive, so people are not able to give meaningful consent as to how their personal data is used.</p><p>\"Big Tech is profiting by abusing an individual's right to privacy. We've previously seen it with Facebook and now Google, with both embroiled in revelations of targeting of children and reports of secretive hidden websites to harvest data. This is a systemic problem with surveillance-driven Big Tech firms, and companies have got away with it for too long.</p><p>\"Today's fines, while welcome, are a drop in the ocean for a company that made nearly US$140 billion in revenue in 2018. There needs to be tougher efforts by governments to address the underlying human rights risks posed by such large-scale corporate surveillance.\"</p><p>Background</p><p>On Wednesday, US regulators agreed a settlement with Google of US$170 million and ordered changes to privacy on YouTube, after the tech giant was found to have harvested personal information from children without their parents' consent.</p><p>In response to the FTC settlement, YouTube's CEO stated the company will now limit data collection and use for children's content on the platform, and stop serving personalised advertising on such content.</p><p>The fine came on the same day the firm was accused of using secret hidden websites to harvest personal information, according to a report in the Financial Times.</p><p>In response to the Financial Times report, a spokesperson for Google said, \"We do not serve personalised ads or send bid requests to bidders without user consent.\" The spokesperson also said that Google is co-operating with investigations in Ireland and the UK into its advertising business.</p><p>States have an obligation to protect human rights in the context of corporate activities, including through regulation and oversight.

The fine is meager compared to Google's bottom line, but the law allows regulators to ramp up penalties up to 4 percent of their annual global revenue. For Google's parent company Alphabet, that could amount to a $4 billion hit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Google and its Silicon Valley peers, the fine is being seen as a wake-up call that Europe is ready to challenge them on their data practices. And in the U.S., it's raising pressure on American regulators to follow suit and toughen their oversight of tech giants.</p><p>Privacy advocates who believe that Big Tech hasn't done enough to comply with the new law hailed the fine because regulators ruled that some of Google's foundational data collection and advertising practices are illegal. They see the fine as a clear sign of tougher actions ahead from Europe's data authorities.</p><p>\"We are very pleased that for the first time a European data protection authority is using the possibilities of GDPR to punish clear violations of the law,\" said Max Schrems, a privacy activist with the group None of Your Business, which filed the complaint that led to the fine.</p><p>\"Following the introduction of GDPR, we have found that large corporations such as Google simply 'interpret the law differently' and have often only superficially adapted their products,\" Schrems added. \"It is important that the authorities make it clear that simply claiming to be compliant is not enough.\"</p><p>In a statement, a spokesperson for Google said it was reviewing the decision to \"determine our next steps.\"</p><p>\"People expect high standards of transparency and control from us,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're deeply committed to meeting those expectations and the consent requirements of the GDPR.\"</p><p>Privacy activists in the U.S. are hoping regulators and lawmakers here take heed of Europe's example.</p><p>Caitriona Fitzgerald, the chief technology officer and policy director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that the enforcement action from the French data authority CNIL sends a signal to Google and others in Silicon Valley. Fitzgerald said the action also offers a clear blueprint for how authorities on this side of the Atlantic should police internet giants.</p><p>\"It's hard to say how much you have to fine Google to hurt them, but it's stronger than anything we've seen here in the U.S.,\" Fitzgerald told The Hill. \"I think U.S. consumers should ask why the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] is failing to act against these tech companies.\"</p><p>The fine comes as Congress is inching toward a comprehensive privacy bill that would implement the nation's first overarching data protection rules. It also arrives as the FTC investigates whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent agreement in its handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>The tech industry's critics in Congress and in the privacy world have grown increasingly impatient with the FTC, which they believe is ill-equipped to take on the role of a U.S. data privacy watchdog and has so far failed to use its existing authority to rein in internet giants.</p><p>Privacy advocates said the fine on Google highlights the difference between the U.S. and European approaches to policing the industry.</p><p>The fine on Google came just eight months after GDPR went into effect in May. Meanwhile, the FTC has remained silent about its Facebook probe, which has been underway since March.</p><p>\"This decision ratchets up the pressure on the FTC to show that it has the guts to take on Facebook and Google,\" said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. \"It's the same practices and the same companies and yet they are fearful of taking a stand.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the FTC did not respond when asked for comment. The government shutdown has rendered the agency largely unoperational.</p><p>Critics have called on Congress to follow Europe's lead by creating a new federal agency solely dedicated to protecting user privacy. They say the FTC is a relatively small agency with limited authority that extends to policing companies for deceptive business practices. Critics say the U.S. would be better off with a watchdog with the resources and mandate to ensure companies don't abuse user data.</p><p>\"Almost every democratic country in the world has an authority focused on data protection so the U.S. is kind of alone in that regard,\" Fitzgerald said.</p><p>It's unclear when Congress will come up with a set of rules for the U.S. market, but some lawmakers and tech critics believe that Europe has set the benchmark for cracking down on the industry with Monday's fine.</p><p>That is likely to leave both the tech industry and its domestic regulators scrambling.</p><p>\"Google finally beginning to face accountability in Europe for its blatant disregard for data privacy,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wrote in a tweet. \"The days of Google &amp; Big Tech running unchecked in America must also quickly come to an end.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9G-6NS1-DYTB-V031-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

The fine is meager compared to Google's bottom line, but the law allows regulators to ramp up penalties up to 4 percent of their annual global revenue. For Google's parent company Alphabet, that could amount to a $4 billion hit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Google and its Silicon Valley peers, the fine is being seen as a wake-up call that Europe is ready to challenge them on their data practices. And in the U.S., it's raising pressure on American regulators to follow suit and toughen their oversight of tech giants.</p><p>Privacy advocates who believe that Big Tech hasn't done enough to comply with the new law hailed the fine because regulators ruled that some of Google's foundational data collection and advertising practices are illegal. They see the fine as a clear sign of tougher actions ahead from Europe's data authorities.</p><p>\"We are very pleased that for the first time a European data protection authority is using the possibilities of GDPR to punish clear violations of the law,\" said Max Schrems, a privacy activist with the group None of Your Business, which filed the complaint that led to the fine.</p><p>\"Following the introduction of GDPR, we have found that large corporations such as Google simply 'interpret the law differently' and have often only superficially adapted their products,\" Schrems added. \"It is important that the authorities make it clear that simply claiming to be compliant is not enough.\"</p><p>In a statement, a spokesperson for Google said it was reviewing the decision to \"determine our next steps.\"</p><p>\"People expect high standards of transparency and control from us,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're deeply committed to meeting those expectations and the consent requirements of the GDPR.\"</p><p>Privacy activists in the U.S. are hoping regulators and lawmakers here take heed of Europe's example.</p><p>Caitriona Fitzgerald, the chief technology officer and policy director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that the enforcement action from the French data authority CNIL sends a signal to Google and others in Silicon Valley. Fitzgerald said the action also offers a clear blueprint for how authorities on this side of the Atlantic should police internet giants.</p><p>\"It's hard to say how much you have to fine Google to hurt them, but it's stronger than anything we've seen here in the U.S.,\" Fitzgerald told The Hill. \"I think U.S. consumers should ask why the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] is failing to act against these tech companies.\"</p><p>The fine comes as Congress is inching toward a comprehensive privacy bill that would implement the nation's first overarching data protection rules. It also arrives as the FTC investigates whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent agreement in its handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>The tech industry's critics in Congress and in the privacy world have grown increasingly impatient with the FTC, which they believe is ill-equipped to take on the role of a U.S. data privacy watchdog and has so far failed to use its existing authority to rein in internet giants.</p><p>Privacy advocates said the fine on Google highlights the difference between the U.S. and European approaches to policing the industry.</p><p>The fine on Google came just eight months after GDPR went into effect in May. Meanwhile, the FTC has remained silent about its Facebook probe, which has been underway since March.</p><p>\"This decision ratchets up the pressure on the FTC to show that it has the guts to take on Facebook and Google,\" said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. \"It's the same practices and the same companies and yet they are fearful of taking a stand.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the FTC did not respond when asked for comment. The government shutdown has rendered the agency largely unoperational.</p><p>Critics have called on Congress to follow Europe's lead by creating a new federal agency solely dedicated to protecting user privacy. They say the FTC is a relatively small agency with limited authority that extends to policing companies for deceptive business practices. Critics say the U.S. would be better off with a watchdog with the resources and mandate to ensure companies don't abuse user data.</p><p>\"Almost every democratic country in the world has an authority focused on data protection so the U.S. is kind of alone in that regard,\" Fitzgerald said.</p><p>It's unclear when Congress will come up with a set of rules for the U.S. market, but some lawmakers and tech critics believe that Europe has set the benchmark for cracking down on the industry with Monday's fine.</p><p>That is likely to leave both the tech industry and its domestic regulators scrambling.</p><p>\"Google finally beginning to face accountability in Europe for its blatant disregard for data privacy,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wrote in a tweet. \"The days of Google &amp; Big Tech running unchecked in America must also quickly come to an end.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-4031-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

The sum is a record penalty imposed by the UK's data watchdog, but by Facebook's standards it was chump change.</p><p>For its role in a controversy that covers multiple elections and saw the details of millions of Facebook users compromised, the world's fifth biggest company, run by the world's fourthrichest man, faces a fine equal to the price of a one-bedroom flat in Zone 2. Facebook's revenue last year totalled $40.7bn (\u00a330.7bn), so half a million pounds takes just under 10 minutes to make back.</p><p>The paucity of the penalty is not down to reluctance on the part of the ICO. The regulator's hands were tied by the 1998 Data Protection Act, a law that pre-dates Facebook by six years. Its devisers never anticipated the scale of data controversies that would erupt in the next century.</p><p>IMAGES GDPR, the new European law that supersedes the act, came into force in May. Under it, Facebook would have faced a maximum fine of $1.6bn, 4pc of last year's revenue. However, the loophole that exposed 87m users' private details to be unwittingly collected and passed to Cambridge Analytica was closed in 2015.</p><p>Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, claimed the reputational damage of being fined was more significant. That is hard to believe. There is no evidence that Facebook's users have fled the social network. The company's share price is at an all-time high, and no significant advertisers have abandoned it.</p><p>It is little surprise that the company has answered questions from MPs with what have been described as a \"consistently slow and unsatisfactory responses\". Despite the threat of a formal summons, Zuckerberg has refused to give evidence to MPs.</p><p>Facebook has largely devoted time to where it faces serious sanctions: Washington, where a phalanx of agencies including the FBI are investigating; and Brussels, the centre of power most hostile to big tech.</p><p>Belatedly, UK authorities now have the teeth to introduce appropriate sanctions when companies fail to care for private information. Next time, perhaps, that will mean something.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-139498522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SSH-KJP1-DY9P-N2TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"381\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 12, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp;

A scammer got into its system, probably by hacking the account of someone working in the company, and acquired some of the special privileges that internal staff possess in order to do their work. This enabled the intruder to take over the accounts of some very prominent Twitter users, including Barack Obama, though not - interestingly - Donald Trump, to send out invitations to donate Bitcoin to a particular cryptographic \"wallet\" that would then return twice the amount donated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You'd have to be pretty dumb to fall for this, though apparently some people did. In fact, it was just a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/130-high-profile-twitter-accounts-targeted-in-hacking-attack\">variation on a known scam-genre</url>. What made it distinctive was the spoofing of accounts of prominent people.</p><p>We now know a bit about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/130-high-profile-twitter-accounts-targeted-in-hacking-attack\">how this was accomplished</url>, essentially via activating a password-reset process. Twitter says there's no evidence that most users' passwords were compromised. It's less forthcoming about whether the direct messages (DMs) sent by the compromised accounts were accessed. If they were, this might turn out to be a really big deal because, scandalously, DMs are still not encrypted.</p><p>Although the scam itself was laughable, the implications - for Twitter and the world - are not. When it launched in 2006, Twitter looked like a rather sweet joke but it has now morphed into a blend of things, both positive and negative: the world's newswire; a conduit for all kinds of good, bad and indifferent information; a battleground for what the Oxford scholar Philip Howard once called \"Lie Machines\"; and Donald Trump's megaphone.</p><p>So what happens on Twitter now really matters. In 2013, for example, a hacker took over the Associated Press account and falsely reported that there had been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/130-high-profile-twitter-accounts-targeted-in-hacking-attack\">two explosions in the White House</url> and that President Obama had been injured. The stock market briefly dropped like a stone.</p><p>One of the things the pandemic has done is to make everyone realise the extent to which the internet - and the services that run on it - has become the critical infrastructure of 21st-century life. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/130-high-profile-twitter-accounts-targeted-in-hacking-attack\">survey of 2,000 Americans</url> conducted last week, for example, found that 77% of those interviewed said \"they don't know what they'd do on a daily basis\" without the technology; similar experiences are reported everywhere.</p><p>The kinds of lockdown we've experienced would have been impossible to manage in the pre-internet age. Take just one example. Last December, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/130-high-profile-twitter-accounts-targeted-in-hacking-attack\">Zoom</url> had 10 million daily meeting participants; by last month, that figure had grown to 300 million. Much the same is reported for Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Cisco's Webex and other conferencing tools.</p><p>There are, however, a couple of major downsides to this massive increase in our dependence on the technology. The first concerns what security specialists call the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/130-high-profile-twitter-accounts-targeted-in-hacking-attack\">\"attack surface\"</url> - the different points where a hacker can try to intrude on, and exploit, an environment. The key to computer security is to reduce the attack surface as much as possible. However, the pandemic has forced us to make it as large as possible.</p><p>We now have hundreds of millions of non-technical employees working from home on insecure laptops, using flaky (and often hackable) network connections to ferry sensitive or confidential data to and from their physical workplaces. In other words, the lockdown has created<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/130-high-profile-twitter-accounts-targeted-in-hacking-attack\">a hacker's dreamworld</url> - an unimaginable forest of low-hanging fruit.</p><p>The result? Cybercrime is one of the fastest-growing businesses. An IBM spokesman was reported the other day as saying the company had seen \"a 6,000% increase in Covid-related spam\" at the height of the pandemic. A typical example (from US experience): an email dispatched to people who \"are desperate for PPP [the US Paycheck Protection Program]. It installs malware into their computers, steals all their information [and] says, 'If you don't pay us a ransom we will infect you and your family with Covid-19'.\" Hospitals in Europe dealing with coronavirus patients have had ransomware attacks. The FBI is reporting a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/130-high-profile-twitter-accounts-targeted-in-hacking-attack\">massive increase in attacks</url>. And so it goes on.</p><p>The second, and potentially more lethal, downside of the pandemic comes from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/130-high-profile-twitter-accounts-targeted-in-hacking-attack\">failure of social-media platforms to curb virus-related disinformation</url>. It has become abundantly clear since 2016 that Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter are unable to control, effectively, the volume of conspiracy theories, disinformation and other garbage that pollute their privately owned public spaces.</p><p>At the root of this incapacity lie two factors. One is the sheer scale of the volume of content that has to be moderated; machine-learning technology can help with this but it is clearly not up to coping with the malign ingenuity of manipulative humans. The other is that the business models of the platforms, which prioritise \"user engagement\", militate against <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/130-high-profile-twitter-accounts-targeted-in-hacking-attack\">more robust editorial control</url>.</p><p>Given that, as societies try to recover from the pandemic, an alarming scenario begins to loom. It goes like this: a vaccine is invented and countries embark on massive vaccination programmes. However, conspiracy theorists use social media to oppose the programme and undermine public confidence in the vaccination drive. It will be like the anti-MMR campaign but on steroids.</p><p>What we have learned from the coronavirus crisis so far is that the only way to manage it is by coherent, concerted government action to slow the transmission rate. As societies move into a vaccination phase, then an analogous approach will be needed to slow the circulation of misinformation and destructive antisocial memes on social media. Twitter would be much improved by removing the retweet button, for example. Users would still be free to pass on ideas but the process would no longer be frictionless. Similarly, Facebook's algorithms could be programmed to introduce a delay in the circulation of certain kinds of content. YouTube's recommender algorithms could be modified to prioritise different factors from those they currently favour. And so on.Measures such as these will be anathema to the platforms. Tough. In the end, they will have to make choices between their profits and the health of society. If they get it wrong then regulation is the only way forward. And governments will have to remember that to govern is to choose. </p><p> John Naughton is an Observer columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-64546408</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CY-7001-JCJY-G11Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><timeReceived>9:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 19, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

'No cold call' is basically the practice whereby companies agree not to recruit each other's highly skilled employees and conspire to fix and restrict their salaries at below-free-market rates.

The thought had not really occurred to me until last week, when I joined a call with CEO Steve Huffman and his general counsel, Benjamin Lee. The executives were briefing me and some other reporters about a significant expansion of the site's content moderation policies, which were unveiled on Monday and resulted in the removal of 2,000 subreddits, including the notorious forum for hate speech The_Donald.</p><p><br/>Reddit's content moderation scheme differs sharply from the Facebook News Feed or the Twitter timeline. Instead of applying one set of rues for the entire user base, Reddit sets a \"floor\" of rules that no one can violate but allows individual forums (called subreddits) to raise the \"ceiling.\" (I wrote about this approach here last month.) This helps create a collective context for discussions, and allows users who have similar values to come together in a shared space online. It's why I can go to my favorite subreddit, which covers the world of professional wrestling, and find an incredible assortment of relevant stories, pictures, and discussions every day. But it also works only because of the moderators who volunteer to enforce a subreddit's rules from floor to ceiling - and those moderators are totally unpaid.<br/>In describing how his thinking on the subject had evolved, Huffman said he had been moved by moderators' stories about their struggles to keep discussions civil. It's a truism of life online that every forum eventually descends into drama, and keeping participants from flaming one another requires constant, even heroic vigilance. But the moderators themselves often become collateral damage, Reddit executives said.<br/>\"To me personally, what was the most heartbreaking was listening to moderators, who would talk about getting these crazy death threats,\" Lee said. \"And they would say something like, 'oh, but I understand that that's protected as a matter of free speech.' And my first reaction is, oh my God, that's not true! The first amendment does not protect that! ... There's a disconnect there - the fact that they could on any level believe that the law, let alone our policies, don't protect them is a fail. And it's a fail we need to fix.\"<br/>One way you can address this policy is rolling out new rules that more expressly prohibit hate speech, as Reddit did this week. But if you're the sort of person who thinks of content moderators as first responders - people whose work is more in line with a police officer or a firefighter than it is typically given credit for - you might not think that's enough. There are a lot of jobs you can do for which you will not routinely be subjected to death threats; moderating a web forum is not one of them.<br/>If that's the case, isn't the least Reddit could do to pay these moderators?<br/>Reddit is a 15-year-old company with a fairly complicated corporate history involving a sale, a spinout, and a new life as an old startup. The company sells premium memberships and advertising. According to TechCrunch, it has more monthly active users than Twitter, is valued at $3 billion, and last December was on track to earn $267.1 million in 2021.<br/>I asked Huffman and Lee whether the moderators who keep all those subreddits humming didn't deserve something beyond an update to the content policy - and didn't quite get an answer.<br/>\"The mods - and there are many thousands of them - are are a critical part of this equation,\" Huffman told me. \"The message that we're trying to convey ... is, we can do much more to support you. The mods - the value that they get out of this, or at least what they want to get out of this, is in being leaders of these communities, and creating a space for their passions. And them having to put up with a bunch of garbage to do so is not fair.\"<br/>Huffman said that \"how our relationship with them evolves over time may be a topic for a different conversation [about] how Reddit the platform evolves.\" But he suggested the company might revisit the question over the next few years.<br/>\"The policies are just the first step in the journey and that partnership with the mods,\" Lee added. \"There's a whole bunch of other things we are both looking at and thinking about in terms of supporting them, including product improvements.\"<br/>Policy updates and product improvements are great. But I suspect that, for a lot of moderators, cash would go a lot further.<br/>II.<br/>The Facebook ad boycott continues. On Wednesday, ads from 400 brands disappeared from Facebook and Instagram, Reuters reported. The coalition of civil rights groups that is leading the boycott has meetings planned with company executives, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to join. Most of the biggest advertisers are not yet participating. But more are pulling their ads each day.<br/>Nick Clegg, the company's head of policy and communications, put up a blog post making the case that Facebook does a pretty good job of removing hate speech:<br/>\"More than 100 billion messages are sent on our services every day. That's all of us, talking to each other, sharing our lives, our opinions, our hopes and our experiences. In all of those billions of interactions a tiny fraction are hateful. When we find hateful posts on Facebook and Instagram, we take a zero tolerance approach and remove them. [...]<br/>Unfortunately, zero tolerance doesn't mean zero incidences. With so much content posted every day, rooting out the hate is like looking for a needle in a haystack.<br/>I continue to be rather cynical about the motives of the brands here, for reasons I laid out on Monday. But I'd note that Clegg's post reinforces a point I made then: what has been presented as being primarily a story about policy and enforcement is actually a story about Facebook's size. A company that hosts 100 billion messages a day is a company that is going to host a lot of hate speech, period.<br/>If advertisers sincerely wanted to address Facebook's hate speech problem, they would start there. But the whole appeal of Facebook to them is its vast reach. So I'm not holding my breath.<br/>The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.<br/>Trending down: Facebook mistakenly shared some users' personal data with outside developers for a longer period of time than promised. The error represents a breach in the policies the social network implemented following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (Kurt Wagner / Bloomberg)<br/>Trending down: Zoom missed its own deadline on releasing a transparency report that will tell the public how many government demands for user data it has received. The report was supposed to come out on June 30th. Zoom hasn't given a firm new date for releasing the figures. (Zack Whittaker / TechCrunch)<br/>Governing\u2b50 Apple CEO Tim Cook has agreed to testify in the House antitrust investigation. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai already committed to testify. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is also reportedly on board; the hearing is expected to take place later this month. Here's Mikey Campbell at Apple Insider:<br/>The House Antitrust Subcommittee last year announced a bipartisan investigation into \"platform gatekeepers\" and \"dominant\" tech firms. Apple is being scrutinized for its App Store business, so-called \"Sherlocking\" of third-party apps and systematic removal of parental control apps.<br/>While Bezos, Pichai and Zuckerberg each signaled intent to participate in the House inquiry last month, Apple remained mum on Cook's potential involvement.<br/>In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Cicilline said he expected the executives to offer testimony on their own accord, but cautioned the committee would issue subpoenas if needed.<br/>UK regulators released a report saying that Google's deal with Apple to be the default search engine on Safari creates \"a significant barrier to entry and expansion\" for Google's competitors. Apple received the majority of the $1.5 billion that Google paid to be the default search engine on a variety of devices in the UK in 2019.

Tech business groups have been calling for the state to hold off on enforcement because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Privacy waits for no disease! (Rachel Lerman / The Washington Post)<br/>Facebook plans to ask the Supreme Court to rule that tracking web users via the \"Like\" button doesn't violate the federal wiretap law. The news comes after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to revisit its earlier ruling that Facebook's alleged tracking may have violated a federal law restricting the interception of online communications. (Wendy Davis / Media Post)<br/>Google threatened to cut off European publishers from a lucrative flow of ads if they followed through with a plan to curb the company's data collection practices. Publishers had expected to use new data privacy measures to bar Google from storing insights about readers. (Paresh Dave / Reuters)<br/>Rockland County plans to use subpoenas to investigate a new cluster of COVID-19 cases tied to a large party earlier this month, given by someone who knew they had symptoms. The county initially tried to use contact tracers to investigate the event, but found people wouldn't cooperate. Yikes.

(Paul Mozur and Nicole Perlroth / The New York Times)<br/>Industry\u2b50 Google is pushing back its plans to reopen US offices after coronavirus cases started to surge. All US offices will remain closed until September 7th at the earliest. Does anyone believe Googlers are actually going back to work in September? I don't. Here's Gerrit De Vynck at Bloomberg:<br/>COVID-19 is spreading fast again in the U.S., prompting some states to reverse earlier decisions to relax lockdowns. California, where Google is based, reported its second-biggest jump in new cases on Tuesday.<br/>\"While conditions do vary from state to state, we need to see that the U.S. outlook as a whole is stable before we move forward,\" Chris Rackow, vice president of global security, wrote in the memo. \"As the recent resurgence of cases demonstrates, Covid-19 is still very much alive in our communities.\" Bloomberg News obtained a copy of the memo.<br/>Twitch broke another viewership record in the second quarter of 2020.

The institute also urged developers to stop using the training library, and to delete any copies. (Katyanna Quach / The Register)<br/>Reporters have feelings about working with Facebook's vast public-relations apparatus. I've had my ups and downs with that crew - the most notable down serves as the lead anecdote in this story - but I'd add that it has changed significantly for the better over the past four years. Generally these days I find Facebook PR to be fast, responsive, and truthful. And for all that this story has to say about secrecy, I'd note that Facebook has done more of its work in public in 2020 than any other company we regularly write about here. Its CEO has had multiple press conferences during the pandemic. Why hasn't that been true of Apple, or Google, or Amazon, or Twitter? (Jacob Silverman / Columbia Journalism Review)<br/>Facebook's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun announced he was going to stop tweeting after getting involved in a long and often acrimonious dispute regarding racial biases in AI. The Twitter feud saw LeCun run afoul of what he termed \"the linguistic codes of modern social justice.\" (Synced)<br/>Facebook has a new proof-of-concept virtual reality headset that looks like a pair of large sunglasses.

The features already existed in beta versions of WhatsApp, but now they're official.

The move comes amid a crackdown of conservative content on social media platforms, with users on Facebook, Twitter and Youtube being censored, suspended, banned and demonetized and Trump calling for a social media summit to address the censorship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since 2016, the r/The Donald subreddit has grown significantly and is a highly trafficked go-to locale for Trump supporters online. It describes itself as \"a never-ending rally dedicated to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.\"</p><p> In a message to the group by one of its moderators on June 26 announcing the quarantine and measures being taken to be reinstated, it stated, \"we were quarantined without warning for some users that were upset about the Oregon Governor sending cops to round up Republican lawmakers to come back to vote on bills before their state chambers. None of these comments that violated Reddit's rules and our Rule 1 [against advocating violence] were ever reported to us moderators to take action on. Those comments were reported on by an arm of the DNC and picked up by multiple news outlets.\"</p><p> So, there were a few posts that advocated violence, but they were not reported to the group's moderators, but to the media. Namely, Media Matters ran an article \"A pro-Trump subreddit is full of calls for violence in support of Oregon Republicans.\" Two days later, the subreddit was quarantined.</p><p> So, it's a typical story for the internet. In a forum with hundreds of thousands of users, just like every comments section on a large website or Facebook or Twitter, some nasty, rotten comments get included. When something is reported to moderators, they remove it. But most people just ignore the offending comments and carry on civil discussions, but according to Reddit, they are now expected to wield omniscient control and report any posts that violate rules.</p><p> And if they don't, it's ban-land for r/ The Donald.</p><p> Never mind that the offending posts violated the subreddit's own rules which they were enforcing manually. Anyone can understand that when you have 750,000 followers it's hard to moderate each and every comment with just a couple dozen or so moderators and so I imagine stuff slips through the cracks all the time.</p><p> In any event, the group says it is pro-police, and stated, \"we have been very pro law enforcement as long as I can remember, and that is early on in r/The Donald's history. We have many members that are law enforcement that come to our wonderful place and interact because they feel welcome here. Many are fans of President Trump and we are fans of them. They put their lives on the line daily for the safety of our communities. To have this as a reason for our quarantine is abhorrent on our users' part and we will not stand for it.\"</p><p> The post went on to denounce violence and urged followers to help report any calls for violence, as it has done in the past.</p><p> In a letter to the group's moderators, Reddit acknowledged that the subreddit attempts to follow the rules by removing bad posts: \"We recognize that you do remove posts that are reported, but we are troubled that violent content more often goes unreported \"</p><p> And so, Reddit suggests, \"User reports and downvotes are an essential way that Reddit functions to moderate content.\"</p><p> The moderators noted in its initial comment on the letter from Reddit, \"It would seem they've set up an impossible standard as a reason to kill us before the 2020 election.\"</p><p> But, the moderators have since promised to do what they could and are enlisting the entire group to help police content on the subreddit, stating, \"We have a limited amount of moderators and do thousands of actions a day on things that are reported. Our mods work hard and work for free for the love of our President and this community. We cannot go into threads and read every single comment. That is where we need you to come in and help. If you see something that breaks the rules, report it and hit that deport button. The rest of Reddit and many on the left would like to see us gone. They won't hit that report button. They will see it and send it to the media or admins. Don't give them that satisfaction, report it to us and we will take care of it. We have documented cases where they actually will instigate it with alts that we catch and report those.\"</p><p> The moderators also warned users that any violent content would now be summarily banned, \"If you make a comment that breaks the violence rule, you will be banned just like a shill because after this warning, only shills will be doing it to try and get us banned.\"</p><p> In response to the quarantine, Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate, saying, \"the Federal Trade Commission needs to open an investigation into anticompetitive actions by social media platforms. Given the appearance that the activities of various social media platforms are colluding against Republicans, conservatives and Trump supporters for political purposes along with the threat of deplatforming, this significantly harms conservative groups' ability to monetize their organizations and to communicate with their voluntary followers. These platforms set themselves up as neutral arbiters designed to allow organizations to access to their followings they invested resources to develop. The arbitrary denial of service is a violation of the rights and underlying contract when users chose to invest resources into developing followers on these platforms.\"</p><p> One bright side for the subreddit, since the quarantine was announced, they have acquired about another 10,000 followers.</p><p> No word yet on whether r/The </p><p> Donald will be banned for all time, but if it is, watch for calls from conservatives and Republicans that social media Big Tech firms are biased against President Trump and his supporters and need to be regulated in order to protect the digital civil rights of users - and to protect our competitive representative political system. Stay tuned.</p><p> Robert Romano is the Vice President of Public Policy at Americans for Limited Government.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKLA-9dc1980e4a69bff010a1fa16c0295f73</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289B0A38BDF88A NWBKLA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFS-FCG1-JBCN-452R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401937</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1043\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Crowley Post-Signal, Louisiana State Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

'Following on from the announcement by Larry Sanger of a Social Media Strike[2], /r/technology is joining the #SocialMediaStrike. Normal service will resume on the 5th,' reads the message. The strike, conceived by Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger,calls for digital independence from social media platforms. That means throwing off the shackles that chain you to social networks and compel you to share stuff there, except to postnotices about the strike itself. 'We're going to flex our collective muscles and demand that giant, manipulative corporations give us back control over our data, privacy, and user experience,' wrote Sanger in his blog[3].SOCIAL MEDIA STRIKE INFO TWEET Hashtag: #SocialMediaStrike[4] Info: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/mGFSKDoKhE\">https://t.co/mGFSKDoKhE</url>[5] Declaration:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/uboOyDXgs1\">https://t.co/uboOyDXgs1</url>[6] 'Will you strike?' poll:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/VIFZEitsow\">https://t.co/VIFZEitsow</url>[7] Resources/links:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/Osrnvdd3VY\">https://t.co/Osrnvdd3VY</url>[8] \u2014 Larry Sanger (@lsanger) June 30, 2019[9] The social media boycott demands that there be better individual controls over user data, and improved privacy rights against criminal, corporate, and governmental monitoring.It also urges social media services to become more interoperable, and sharply criticizes the current practices embraced by popular platforms that have prioritized profit over all else. In the Declaration of Digital Independence[10], Sanger voiced a numberof concerns that have plagued the big tech companies, putting them in regulators' and lawmakers sights frequently this year. From taking down content based on political considerations to using their reach to influence elections, from adopting algorithms that make it easy to surface controversial content to making it difficult for users to understand how their data is collected, processed and shared, Sanger decried the companies' exploitative approach to manipulate users for profit. 'The most reliable guarantee of our privacy, security, and free speech is not in the form of any enterprise, organization, or government, but instead in the free agreement among free individuals to use common standards and protocols,' Sanger wrote in the declaration[11]. The Social Media Strike is happening today and tomorrow, but it remains to be seen how much noise the blackoutwill make.

Rekindling growth and creating enough good-paying jobs will require wholly rethinking how we educate and socialize young people for work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Economic growth since the financial crisis has been a disappointing 2.1 percent, and this year it has slowed to about 1.6 percent. That is not enough to finance our commitments to seniors, rising health care costs and an adequate national defense, never mind provide for federally subsidized child care and other initiatives proposed by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Consumers are spending again, but growth is held back by lackluster business investment. And more is at work than high business taxes, onerous regulations and competition from Chinese imports.</p><p> With accelerating technological progress \u2014 3D printers, automated checkout machines and pocket phones that double as personal assistants \u2014 economists would expect a surge in capital spending and the creation of significant new, higher-paying jobs to implement those innovations. Not just for whiz-kid engineers and industrial designers but also for folks to make and service the devices that replace assembly line workers, store help and clerical workers.</p><p> Those haven't happened for two reasons. Many of the newest machines are fairly inexpensive to install and run, hence businesses can modernize and expand with less capital than in the past. And as retailers and other service enterprises automate and manufacturers switch over from assembling products to making smart machines and robots that do all these things, they face profound skill shortages among American workers.</p><p> Consequently, the dollars spent on new capital equipment throughout the economy remain depressed, and the new jobs created to manufacture and deploy new technologies are simply too few to adequately employ the working-age population.</p><p> Big tech companies like IBM and Hewlett-Packard are shrinking, and Apple and Microsoft are more challenged to grow, not because they can't innovate but because smaller enterprises and the self-employed often can do so more nimbly and efficiently. The latter often can provide business services, hardware and software with more flexible product designs and fewer workers.</p><p> Simply, most big companies are locked into high administrative costs \u2014 eight-figure salaries for executives to preside over armies of paper shufflers \u2014 bureaucratic decision-making, and rigid, quasi-permanent employment relationships that make responding quickly to changing customer expectations too impractical, and redeploying and retraining workers as technology evolves too costly.</p><p> Many big-company workers develop job-specific skills only to be jettisoned by the next wave of innovation and retrenchment, and then they can hardly match their old salaries in the labor market.</p><p> The gig economy is so potent because it permits small businesses to scale up and down, and empowers workers with flexible skills and the capacity for self-direction. More than two-thirds of contract workers do so by choice because they revel in the freedom it offers and ability to define their own career path.</p><p> Sadly, the American work force is sharply divided between those educated at top universities, colleges of engineering and better post-secondary training programs \u2014 who possess the technical and entrepreneurial skills to move frequently among employers or be self-employed \u2014 and those who attended second-tier colleges or have general high school diplomas and often still expect \u2014 or at least hope \u2014 to land a position with an employer who offers training, good pay and a career track. Unfortunately, the IBMs, back offices of banks and government bureaucracies are not creating enough of those kinds of positions, and many are disappearing altogether.</p><p> Further subsidizing college tuition and more resources for public schools won't address that problem. University presidents and other education leaders are too disinclined to downsize liberal arts to adequately increase opportunities to study engineering or require that each child learn to write code instead of reading Chaucer. And faculties are too locked into promotion ladders and tenure to comprehend the gig economy and prepare young people for what they may expect when they leave school.</p><p> At minimum, we need to dramatically expand engineering and other applied arts as was once the primary mission of state universities, send fewer students to four-year colleges, and steer more young people and resources into vocational tracks at community colleges.</p><p> The Germans have great success with skills-based education through cooperative programs with industry \u2014 and that should be our point of departure.</p><p> In case anyone has noticed, its industrial sector is thriving while ours goes begging for qualified workers to modernize and grow.</p><p> \u2022 Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-1601CBC481CD22C8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M00-SGY1-JD6S-R309-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>19 October 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000253</classCode><className>CAPITAL EXPENDITURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL88</classCode><className>ADMINISTRATIVE &amp;

However, she is unmarried with no children or debt, and expects her income will still cover all of her expenses and produce modest savings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I have dual US/British citizenship and am entitled to state pensions from both countries,\" says Sadie. \"However, I do not expect either of these to generate much in 30 years' time, and because the income from my new low-paid job is uncertain I am leaving it out of my calculations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I also have two US and three UK pensions. I have some control over the fund selection within the UK pensions, which I started managing at age 26.</p><p>\"I also started running an investment portfolio five years ago, which I would like to be the principal source of a comfortable retirement income from age 65. So far it has delivered an annual return of 13 per cent and my pensions have delivered an average annual return of about 9 per cent. But, based on historical performance and the current low-growth climate, I have set my annual return target at 7 per cent. This should build up a fund large enough to provide an annual income of around \u00a355,000 by the time I retire at 65, assuming 4 per cent interest on the capital and no further contributions.</p><p>\"I am moderately risk-tolerant so I have kept to low-cost, comparatively safer active funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). However, I may incur unforeseen costs between now and when I retire, for example, when buying a house, which I might do in the next three years, or raising a future family. So I need growth to be able to meet my target, and I'm prepared to take on significantly more risk to achieve this. I could stomach a loss of up to 30 per cent in any given year.</p><p>\"I have a long-term investment horizon. I typically hold between 10 and 15 investments for a minimum of one year, and aim to keep the core holdings on a semi-permanent basis.</p><p>\"The portfolio is designed to be low-maintenance. I have diversified it across markets with a bias to the US. Last year I started a portfolio of US-listed stocks, mainly dividend aristocrats [S&amp;P 500 companies that have grown their dividends every year for 25 years or more] and growth companies. </p><p>\"I pick sectors and markets that seem like they might consistently deliver double-digit growth. I reinvest dividends, keep transaction and management costs low, and hold my investments in tax-efficient wrappers where possible. I check my portfolio every week and adjust the allocation twice a year.</p><p>\"I have avoided bonds because I think they are overvalued and UK interest rates may rise.

IT IS GENERAL INFORMATION BASED ON A SNAPSHOT OF THIS READER'S CIRCUMSTANCES.                   </p><p>                     THE BIG PICTURE                   </p><p>                     Chris Dillow, Investors Chronicle's economist, says:                   </p><p>I fear that your target returns are too high. In the long run it's unlikely that the stock market will grow faster than the economy. This suggests we should assume average total returns in real terms of around 5 per cent per year, most of which will come from dividends. This suggests that your portfolio could grow to around \u00a3800,000, which would give you an income in today's money of just over \u00a330,000 a year.</p><p>There is, of course, uncertainty around this. Past volatility suggests you have a one-in-six chance of ending up with less than \u00a3650,000 and a one-in-six chance of more than \u00a3950,000. Such probabilities, however, assume that the future will resemble the past and perhaps understate actual future uncertainty.</p><p>So I'm concerned that your future savings may be small. Savings aren't just a reliable way of increasing your wealth, they're also a form of risk management. If you save a lot, you can, in effect, hedge against a price fall by buying more when prices are low.</p><p>Savings are also a way of hedging against changes in your future preferences. You might feel fine about working until you're 65 now but by the time you are in your 50s you might not. More savings give you the option of quitting full-time work earlier.</p><p>                     James Norrington, specialist writer at Investors Chronicle, says:                   </p><p>The Credit Suisse Investment Yearbook has found that the annualised long-run real rate of total return from global equities between 1900 and 2017 is 5.2 per cent. If matched over the next 30 years, this would give you \u00a3847,773 in today's money. That's enough for a reasonably comfortable retirement, especially if by that time you paid down any mortgage commitments.</p><p>But there is no guarantee of future performance. And there have been big variations in equity performance over 30-year periods - your investment timeframe. Between 1990 and 2018 global equities delivered annualised real returns of 4.6 per cent. That rate of return over the next 30 years would leave you with \u00a3714,098 - okay, but almost 16 per cent less than if there is a 5.2 per cent growth rate.</p><p>The annualised rate since 1990 is lower thanks to savage equity bear markets following the dot.com crash at the turn of the millennium and during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. This highlights the risk that stock markets could fall by more, peak-to-trough, than the 30 per cent you can tolerate. Between the market peak in 2007 and the nadir of the financial crisis in 2009, the MSCI World index fell 54 per cent.</p><p>                     Andrea Solana, head of advanced planning at <url normalizedValue=\"https://masecoprivatewealth.com/\">Maseco Private Wealth</url>, says:                   </p><p>Having dual US and UK citizenship means you have worldwide tax filing obligations to both jurisdictions as long as you remain a US citizen who is UK resident. The US also taxes certain income and investment products very differently compared with the UK. So, even if you structure a portfolio to be tax-efficient in the UK, the benefits could be undone by the punitive tax treatment of the same assets in the US.</p><p>Non-US regulated collective investments such as open-ended investment companies (Oeics), unit trusts or exchange traded funds (ETFs) are known as Passive Foreign Investment Companies (PFIC). These carry annual informational reporting obligations on a US tax return and when gains are realised, they are generally taxed in the US at the highest marginal income tax rate, which is currently 37 per cent. And an interest charge is applied over the period of ownership. This is regardless of other sources of income.</p><p>US regulated collective investments that do not have UK reporting status attract offshore income gains (OIG) taxation as opposed to capital gains treatment in the UK. OIG assets do not benefit from the capital gains tax allowance, and gains are taxed at their holder's relevant income tax band, for example, 40 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer as opposed to capital gains tax at 20 per cent.</p><p>Direct shares and bond holdings, US regulated ETFs with UK reporting status, and US regulated mutual funds with UK reporting status can be held tax-efficiently by US citizens living in the UK, even outside a tax wrapper that is recognised by the US-UK income tax treaty such as an occupational pension scheme.</p><p>This is also the case with cash deposits, but these are not suitable for a short-, medium- or long-term investment strategy given current interest rates.</p><p>As individual savings accounts (Isas) are not tax-exempt products from a US perspective, you should ensure that the investments in you hold in your Isa are tax-efficient in the US, as any gains or income will be subject to US taxes.</p><p>Understanding the tax interactions between the US and the UK is essential if you are to achieve acceptable after-tax investment returns that will meet your long-term planning needs. Putting the maximum amount possible into workplace pension schemes, to the extent that your savings are for retirement goals, could be a valuable way to mitigate some US tax and receive tax relief on contributions.</p><p>An average annual return of 13 per cent is good; however, investors have been spoiled by five years of above-average annual returns. For example, the average annual return of the S&amp;P 500 over the last 30 years is 8 per cent before fees. And a long-term investment target of 7 per cent a year is still somewhat high considering current valuations and expected future returns - even with a higher growth oriented portfolio.</p><p>As you expect your future income to cover all expenses and still produce modest savings, this means that a large majority of your investible asset base has a long-term time horizon and can afford to be more growth oriented.</p><p>                     HOW TO IMPROVE THE PORTFOLIO                   </p><p>                     Chris Dillow says:                   </p><p>The wisdom of this portfolio depends to a large extent on what your time horizon is. If it is 30 years then it's dangerous to hold even what seem to be the best stocks because we cannot predict how they'll cope with 30 years of creative destruction. So it's far wiser to back the field rather than particular horses. </p><p>And it's not certain that growth sectors such as biotech and information technology will be winners over a 30-year horizon. Over the last 30 years the best-performing UK sectors have included chemicals, tobacco and beverages, rather than conventional growth stocks. Valuations and sound business models matter more than growth, for which investors often pay too much.</p><p>As you are adjusting the portfolio every six months, however, your time horizon is in effect six months. This justifies otherwise questionable investments. For example, your stock holdings are mostly a play on whether investors will continue to want to pay more for monopoly-type stocks. This is a reasonable short-term bet. I fear, though, that there might come a point when investors overcorrect their past underpricing of such stocks, with the result that they'll end up overpriced.</p><p>And you would be better to consider <url normalizedValue=\"https://masecoprivatewealth.com/\">Lyxor MSCI World Information Technology TR UCITS ETF</url> (TNOG) as a play upon momentum rather than upon growth - like your Bitcoin holding is.</p><p>Regular rebalancing can be problematic depending on how you do it. Unaided judgment runs the risk that you fall victim to the countless errors we can make.</p><p>So I'd remind you of the merits of the 10-month moving average rule, which says you should buy or hold when prices are above their 10-month or 200-day average, and sell when they are below it. This works much better with speculative assets than value stocks.</p><p>Such a strategy won't always work: you will sometimes wrongly sell on dips. It will, however, protect you from the deep losses you can suffer in prolonged bear markets. And it'll protect you from holding onto bad investments in the forlorn hope of eventually breaking even.</p><p>Long-term investing requires discipline. So if you can't save regularly at least have a disciplined strategy.</p><p>                     James Norrington says:                   </p><p>Although it is reasonable to have most of your investments in equities you would benefit from some diversification.</p><p>Bonds are even more expensive than shares, and low yields have encouraged some bond funds hunting income to move into riskier corporate credit, including low-grade high-yielding debt and emerging markets bonds. </p><p>But the rising interest rate environment in the US improves the rewards of diversifying some risk with US Treasuries. Their yield is now around 3 per cent, which is an unwarranted spread in terms of credit risk over comparable developed country debt. And there could be price appreciation if investors seek a safe haven in response to a sell-off in equities. As you have roots in the US these should be an attractive diversification option, although there could be dollar-sterling currency risk if you retire outside the US.</p><p>It is quite common for someone of your age in employment to have 80 per cent of their long-term assets in equities. But you can reduce risk if you are ahead of your long-term target returns. And the the nearer you get to retirement, the more you should move into low-risk, short duration government bonds. At that stage, a 50 per cent equity market fall would be harder to recover from.</p><p>I like that your equity allocation is internationally diverse. You have a high allocation to the US but, proportionately, the same would be true if you invested in a market capitalised weighted global equities tracker fund.</p><p>You have taken thematic biases with your funds, which is fine if you believe areas such as tech and healthcare will make the best returns over the next 30 years. Doing this via collective investment vehicles is a sensible approach, as you are less exposed to individual companies failing.</p><p>I assume you hold <url normalizedValue=\"https://masecoprivatewealth.com/\">iShares Core S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF</url> (CSP1) for whole of market diversification but this is hugely exposed to tech due to the enormous weighting of the so-called FAANGs -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://masecoprivatewealth.com/\">Facebook</url> (US:FB),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://masecoprivatewealth.com/\">Amazon</url> (US:AMZN),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://masecoprivatewealth.com/\">Apple</url> (US:AAPL),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://masecoprivatewealth.com/\">Netflix</url> (US:NFLX) and Google, listed as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://masecoprivatewealth.com/\">Alphabet</url> (US:GOOGL). On top of this you have a direct holding in Apple, which means you are especially vulnerable to the fortunes of big tech.</p><p>This may turn out to be a good call over the long term, but you should be aware that when adding or selling investments your portfolio could be more concentrated in one sector than you think. You don't need to cut this exposure but think about balance when you're trimming it.</p><p>                     Andrea Solana says:                                        </p><p>You have a moderate risk tolerance and preference for collective funds, so that your portfolio is low-maintenance and more diversified. But consider diversifying across even more asset classes.</p><p>You don't like bonds because of the current interest rate environment but they are a diversifying element in a portfolio, so perhaps should not be completely discounted. You should also be diversified across different geographies but have a bias to the US. The US represents about 55 per cent of global stock markets, so if your portfolio has an allocation to US equities of more than 55 per cent, it could be considered overweight in this area.</p><p>To maximise after-tax costs you need to consider the costs of investments, platforms, trading and tax. Your Isa is full of PFICs, which not only complicate annual filing requirements but can also result in very high tax charges on gains realised in US dollars. Your Isa is viewed as a taxable account in the US, so it could be beneficial to focus it on direct share and direct bond holdings, and fixed-term deposits or cash.</p><p>If you want to invest in low-cost collective funds you should hold them in qualifying pension funds to avoid incurring PFIC issues, or in an account on a US platform that sells US regulated collectives with UK reporting status. US platforms are also generally cheaper than UK platforms, and these costs affect your overall net return.</p><p>Also, remember that the currency risk you are exposed to is that of the underlying investments within the funds you hold.</p><p>You are considering purchasing a house in the next three years. So, consider lowering the risk profile of whatever proportion of your investments you think you will use for this, as three years is not enough time to ride out short-term volatility in equity markets. If you don't like bonds, hold a higher level of cash for this short-term need.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-44547501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SH3-KF31-JCJY-G50R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2768\"/><timeReceived>10:12 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 7, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUxNjJDMEQ5N0YwNDMzM0JDMjEzM0UzOTYzMzI3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Do Equity Principle</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDU3REJDMkYxQjJFNEU4RDgzQTA1QTQwQjM5RDQ3RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OENDNjZGMThDNzYwNDA3RjhERDREQUJENkIyQkM3Rjk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>Exchange Traded Funds</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxNjA0NTY2Q0M2NEZBQjg3MDBCOUYxNTE4OTg3MDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEZBNjUwRkEwQjJGNDgzQzlEMzMyNEE1RDAyOTY4RkE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>REITs, REMICs, RICs &amp;

New signs this morning that the country is testing its nuclear capabilities on the eve of <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>visit to Asia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome back to EARLY START, everyone. I'm John Berman. Good to see you this morning.</p><p>KOSIK: And I'm Alison Kosik. It's the half past the hour, and we begin with the first sign that authorities may be re-evaluating the search for Flight 370. Overnight, a tropical cyclone forced officials to call off the air search, but the underwater search continues, despite growing concern the hunt for Flight 370 may be headed back to square one.</p><p>Erin McLaughlin live from Perth, Australia this morning.</p><p>Erin, at this point, they're into their ninth, tenth investigation in the water, and it's turned up nothing. Where do they go next?</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Alison. Well, officials have been discussing sort of a long-term search plan. A U.S. Navy official telling CNN that they're talking about the possibility of a long-term search, in the early stages of planning through July, but all eyes still focused on that Bluefin-21. As far as we know, it's still in the water on that tenth dive, and it's in a really critical point in this mission, because this is the place where they feel the most likely area where they're going to find the black box based on a limited set of information or data that they have.</p><p>Now, as of yesterday, it was two-thirds of the way finished searching this area, and officials here in Australia say that it could be complete in just a few days. And at that point, they say they're going to stop and reassess and probably broaden out the search area -- Alison.</p><p>KOSIK: And when they broaden out that search area, what have they got to go on at this point that they maybe didn't have before? Is there any new information coming in?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well, no new information right now. Right now, they're searching based on the best information they say they have. They're looking at the area of the second ping that was picked up by that towed pinger locator. They're searching in a 6-mile radius around that point. Now once that's exhausted, which again Australian officials say could happen in the next few days, they may potentially, some analysts say, turn to some of the other points where they picked up those signals.</p><p>There were three other detections made. They might just broaden out the area in general, possibly along that arc, the half handshake, the so-called half handshake between the Inmarsat satellite and the plane before it went down. They might search that entire area. And Malaysian officials talking about them introducing or exploring the possibility of introducing even more submersibles, because the more submersibles they can introduce, the larger the area in which they can search and the quicker they could potentially find any wreckage -- Alison.</p><p>KOSIK: All right, Erin McLaughlin live from Perth, Australia.</p><p>BERMAN: Thirty-two minutes after the hour. A heartbreaking scene in South Korea this morning. The death toll from the tragic ferry disaster rising to 108. 194 others are still listed as missing. Divers pulling one lifeless body after another from the water, from the sunken ship while devastated families just look on.</p><p>Our Nic Robertson live from Jindo in South Korea this morning.</p><p>And, Nic, it has been a very, very grim morning there, indeed.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It has. It really has. And you can tell that just from sort of the pace at which the bodies are being brought ashore. It really has picked up today. Police marine ship after police marine ship pulling into the harbor side, unloading the bodies. They're going into a temporary, tented, white mortuary on the harbor side.</p><p>And then what we saw were ambulances backing up to the mortuary tent, one, two, three, four at a time, then very slowly, very solemnly, in a very dignified way, stretcher-bearers carrying out each of those bodies, one body into each ambulance. The ambulance is driven away. Then more ambulances driven in to take their place to take away more bodies. So for the families, a very tough day.</p><p>For a few families, the events today, the recovery of the bodies may provide the answers that they want, but for so many more families, it's really, really a matter of waiting for the divers who are still aboard the ship. A very, very difficult wait there, down at the third and fourth level aboard the ship working in very difficult conditions, visibility poor. And the tides today slightly slacker, but they're facing debris inside that ship that's blocking their way.</p><p>So very, very slow, painstaking process aboard the ship and very, very difficult for the families to watch all this unfolding -- John.</p><p>BERMAN: Nic, what's the status of the investigation right now, particularly concerning the captain and the crew of this vessel?</p><p>ROBERTSON: Well, we know that seven crew members, including the captain, who have been charged, the captain potentially could face life in prison for abandoning the ship. We have heard from some of the senior crew members, two 1st officers, a chief engineer and one of the 2nd officers was speaking outside a courtroom as they were charged today, describing how this ship had a history of not being able to right itself very easily or very well.</p><p>They also described how the ship had gone through some extensions. They were asked whether these were legal. The crews said that they didn't know, but the underlying theme of what they were saying was that this ship had problems, and they said when they were steering it on Wednesday, when it -- when it capsized, that it turned very quickly. No explanation for this so far.</p><p>And out at sea, the divers focusing on the rescue, rather than investigating the ship to see what they can discover that might lead to a better understanding of what happened. At sea, the focus very much the rescue, but on land, we're beginning to learn those details from those senior crew members -- John.</p><p>BERMAN: Our Nic Robertson in Jindo, South Korea this morning. Thanks so much, Nic.</p><p>KOSIK: Meantime, there are new worries this morning that North Korea could be closer to conducting a nuclear test.</p><p>Let's get to Andrew Salmon, who's live in Seoul.</p><p>So let me ask you this. The timing of this, this possible movement from North Korea, kind of curious.</p><p>ANDREW SALMON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Kind of curious, you're right. What we can say is it's still spring here on the Korean Peninsula. Always a tense time. This is when the South Koreans and the U.S. carry out their joint maneuvers. Two main exercises are finished, but even today and right through Friday, there is the largest ever air defense exercises with aircraft from both the U.S. and South Korea drilling in the skies above the peninsula.</p><p>So the North Koreans are extremely sensitive to this, and we've seen on North Korean news today Kim Jong-Un himself visiting a North Korean air unit and encouraging them to be prepared to defend their country. But of course, also in even bigger news, U.S. President Barack Obama will be traveling through the region. He's arriving in South Korea on Friday, leaving Saturday.</p><p>And the North Korean Foreign Ministry have been berating this trip using a lot of rhetoric, including saying this will bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to the region. A lot of doomsday rhetoric. But whether, of course, they're prepared to detonate a nuclear device in an underground test site in North Korea while the president is actually in or on the ground, that would be even by North Korean standards an extraordinary provocation.</p><p>KOSIK: OK, Andrew Salmon live from Seoul, thanks.</p><p>And as Andrew said, the latest possible provocation from North Korea comes as <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is set to visit the region, leaving today for a trip that will take him to Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea. But he'll stop first in Washington state to meet with families impacted by a deadly mudslide northeast of Seattle. The death toll in that slide now stands at 41.</p><p>BERMAN: About 37 minutes after the hour right now.</p><p>Chad Myers here, bravely entering the studio, despite the allergies trying to hold him back.</p><p>CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: : Yes, I can see it in the air. Literally, you can see the dust flying around, but it's going to get better today because there's rain on the way. There is rain in Buffalo already, moving to Pittsburgh, all the way down to Atlanta. So if you're suffering out there, it does get better, at least some of the pollen gets washed away. A beautiful day in the city today, high of 70. 77 in D.C., 74 in Atlanta.</p><p>A pretty decent day to fly up and down the East Coast. It will get bumpy later today, probably around 6:00 or 7:00. Could see some bumps up and down the East Coast. Now, it will be bumpy all day in the west. There's just going to be major, just huge turbulence out here, so expect that if you're flying over the Rockies.</p><p>High wind warnings for the desert southwest. Could be 60 to 70-mile- per-hour winds there and dust in the air. That storm moves to the east for tomorrow, making some severe weather across the Midwest, from Nebraska all the way down to Texas.</p><p>Talked about Jack here. Jack kind of hindering the surface search yesterday. At 35 miles per hour right now. Yesterday at this time, though, it was 85, so this storm is dying.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, Chad Myers. Thanks so much for a look of the weather, here and off the coast of Australia as well.</p><p>KOSIK: And this morning, the U.S. is promising more support to Ukraine. Vice President Biden is in Kiev for critical meetings with the interim government, but will it be enough to sway tensions with Russia? We're live with the latest. Next.</p><p>BERMAN: Welcome back to EARLY START, everyone. At this moment, Vice President Biden is meeting with Ukraine's top leaders in Kiev. It's a show of support for that country's embattled interim government. But in the eastern part of Ukraine, pro-Russian gunmen not letting up one bit, seizing more government buildings in a dozen cities and towns.</p><p>Want to bring in Fred Pleitgen right now live from Kiev.</p><p>Fred, give us an update on the goal of these meetings amidst this chaos, really, still in the eastern part of the country.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think chaos is exactly the right word. One of the things that, of course, these two sides are going to be talking about, the top-level of Ukrainian politicians as well as <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>is going to be that situation in the east of the country. And apparently, what the acting president of Ukraine told the vice president was that he believes that the Russians have already breached that Geneva agreement that was reached between the U.S., the EU, Russia, as well as Ukraine last week. And they say that because these pro-Russian separatist groups have taken additional buildings instead of vacating all the buildings that they could and disarming, they feel the agreement's been breached, and the Ukrainians for their part are saying they will react accordingly.</p><p>So certainly a very volatile situation that the vice president has landed into. He's walking a very fine line diplomatically, where on the one hand, the U.S., as you know, has threatened additional sanctions against Moscow if it doesn't de-escalate in the coming days. But of course, the U.S. always wants to keep those diplomatic channels with Moscow open. At the same time, the U.S. wants to prop up the government here in Kiev.</p><p>Several things that we expect to hear out of a press conference that was supposed to start a couple of minutes ago. We're now hearing that they're actually running quite late -- is that the U.S. wants to offer economic assistance, technical assistance and help Ukraine, and this is probably the most important point. Help Ukraine achieve energy security, because they are very dependent on Russian gas, and that's certainly something that the Russians have been using as a weapon in this standoff that they have with Ukraine -- John.</p><p>BERMAN: Fred, I want to talk about the pro-Russian militants right now in the eastern part of Ukraine who have taken over these government buildings. They have shown to be very unresponsive to both the Ukrainian government and to the United States as well.</p><p>Has Russia, has Moscow, has Vladimir Putin shown any inclination right now to get those pro-Russian militants to move?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Zero at this point. In fact, one of the things that we seem to see is that on the one hand, those pro-Russian militants are saying that they don't feel bound by that agreement that was reached. They say it was not signed on their behalf. In fact, they're calling for the government here in Kiev to resign before they will lay down their weapons. And the Russians for their part seem to have a completely different interpretation of that agreement than the West does, that the U.S. does.</p><p>The U.S. say they have to get out of those buildings immediately. The Russians say that if those the pro-Russian protesters are supposed to vacate those buildings in the east of the country, they want the square that's behind me, the Maidan, where of course, the revolution took place a couple of months ago, they want that square to be cleared as well.</p><p>The Russians are also saying that Ukrainian groups who have taken up arms need to lay down those arms before the pro-Russian protesters are set to do that. So there is still a lot of disagreement between the U.S. and Russia.</p><p>There was a phone call last night between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and John Kerry, and quite frankly, that did not lead to very much. So the two sides still very far apart and there really isn't any sign, especially in the east of this country, that there's any de-escalation. And the U.S. know that any de-escalation has to come from Moscow and be initiated by Moscow -- John.</p><p>BERMAN: A rather ominous words from our Fred Pleitgen in Kiev, who says there's been zero movement now towards any kind of diplomatic solution in the eastern part of that country.</p><p>Fred, thank you very much.</p><p>KOSIK: And whether Vice President Biden can even make any headway.</p><p>BERMAN: Exactly. What's to do ? He's there, but what can he produce while he is there?</p><p>KOSIK: Exactly.</p><p>All right. Let's take a look at what's coming up on \"NEW DAY,\" Kate Bolduan joins us now.</p><p>Good morning, Kate.</p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR, NEW DAY: Good morning both of you. We're tracking the latest of course on the search for Flight 370. The underwater sub, that Bluefin-21 is back in the water scanning the ocean floor but so far has yet to turn up any sign of the missing plane. If the Bluefin's search doesn't yield any results, the big question is, what happens next? They are going to start that conversation, they say, and how to plan for a long-term search and what that would mean for all of the resources at hand.</p><p>We're also going to be live on the ground in South Korea, where the death toll is rising again this morning in that deadly ferry accident. The disaster raises really new worries this morning about passenger ferries worldwide, including here in the United States. Are they regulated enough to keep travelers safe? Our maritime experts are going to be weighing in, something probably everyone should listen to, unfortunately -- John and Alison.</p><p>BERMAN: All right. Look forward to seeing that, despite the tone, I think.</p><p>Kate, great to see you this morning.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Thanks, guys.</p><p>BERMAN: We'll be tuning in just a few minutes.</p><p>Meanwhile, 46 minutes after the hour, he is lucky to be alive. A 16- year-old stowaway who hid inside a wheel well on a flight from California to Hawaii. This morning, we're taking a closer look at how he survived being 38,000 feet up in the air. That's coming up next.</p><p>BERMAN: No charges this morning for a 16-year-old from California who hopped a jet from California to Hawaii, riding in the 767's wheel well alongside the landing gear. Doctors are calling it a medical miracle, since in past cases, people who tried hiding in these wheel wells have died of hypothermia or oxygen deprivation, or they've just fallen out of the jet. But this 16-year-old somehow emerged unharmed, perhaps in a way thanks to the cold temperatures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. BEN HONIGMAN, ALTITUDE RESEARCH CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO: He probably became unconscious rather quickly at that elevation. And perhaps with the cold, and if it was in the range of zero to perhaps 30 degrees, then perhaps he went into what we call this slowing down of the machinery state or hibernation that might have protected him and caused him not to need as much oxygen as normally we would if we were exerting ourselves or even sitting here on TV.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN: Breaking into the airport, of course hiding in that plane, against the law, but police in San Jose say the boy will not face charges. Investigators are still trying to find out how he managed to slip past security there.</p><p>KOSIK: This morning tests are under way to figure out just who was killed in what officials call an unprecedented operation in Yemen, targeting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Some 65 suspected militants were targeted, but it's not clear yet if any top-level operatives were killed. A Yemeni official tells CNN that the operation is a joint effort with the U.S., which blames al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for a string of recent plots.</p><p>BERMAN: This morning officials in Salt Lake City still trying to figure out what caused a man to charge a witness inside a federal courtroom. A U.S. Marshal fatally shot Siale Angilau, a reputed gang member, when he reportedly grabbed a pen and charged at the witness, who was testifying about gang life. Angilau was facing racketeering charges. He was shot multiple times and died at the hospital. The judge has declared a mistrial.</p><p>KOSIK: We could soon find out more about the Obama administration's legal reasoning for killing an American citizen overseas. A federal appeals court has told the Justice Department to release key parts of a classified memo used to justify the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki. Intelligence officials say he was a member of al Qaeda and killed him in a 2011 targeted strike in Yemen.</p><p>The judges said the administration could no longer claim privacy since it has talked openly about the killing and even issued a white paper defending the attack. It's unclear when or if the memo may be made public.</p><p>BERMAN: Two planned executions in Oklahoma now on hold after the state Supreme Court stepped in to a battle over the source of the state's lethal injection drugs. The inmates, Clayton Lockett and Charles Warner, challenged the constitutionality of a law allowing the state to keep the source of those drugs secret. Both men have been convicted of rape and murder, and the state says they will die. It's just a matter of how and when.</p><p>KOSIK: A federal appeals court has now been asked to weigh in on the legality of the FAA's ban on private drones. A Texas-based group that searches for missing people wants the right to use unmanned aircraft in its searches, saying the FAA has no authority to ban them. An administrative law judge ruled last month that the agency couldn't find a videographer for using a drone because it was essentially a model airplane. The FAA is appealing that ruling.</p><p>Coming up, did big tech firms conspire to control each other's hiring practices? We're going to have details of new e-mails, next.</p><p>KOSIK: Some biz news for you this morning. European stocks are trading higher right now. Futures in the U.S. are mostly flat.</p><p>One story everyone in Silicon Valley is watching closely, the alleged hiring conspiracy among big tech firms. A class-action lawsuit accuses a handle of big-name tech firms, including Google, Apple and Intel of agreeing not to poach each other's employees as a way of keeping those employees' salaries low.</p><p>What's more, the suit names Steve Jobs as the ringleader of all this. There are new documents that were just revealed that show Jobs e- mailing Google chairman Eric Schmidt after a Google recruiter contacted an Apple employee. Jobs wrote, \"I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this.\" The Google recruiter was fired. Other e-mails show executives trying to convince Facebook to join the scheme. The case is set to go to trial in May.</p><p>And what's interesting with this case, a lot of it's going to be based on actual e-mails from these top executives, like Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt and, you know, the Intel executives, all their e-mails going back and forth, with the smiley faces and everything.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BERMAN: Really intrigue there at that very high level.</p><p>KOSIK: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: At that very high levels of Silicon Valley. KOSIK: All to keep those salaries depressed. And tech workers saying, wait a minute, we're owed more. And, you know, it kind of even underscores how tough it is to find top talent for these companies and how competitive these companies are.</p><p>BERMAN: Any sense that they might settle before going to the full trial?</p><p>KOSIK: That's a good question. We'll see what happens.</p><p>BERMAN: All right. That is all for us this morning. Great to have you with us. \"NEW DAY\" starts right now.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Happening now, part of the search for missing Flight 370 has been suspended as the temp underwater mission is under way with the clock ticking and still no sign of the missing plane. Are they close to calling off the search?</p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking over night. New signs North Korea is testing its nuclear capability. Is the reclusive regime planning to launch a nuclear test? All of this happening on the eve of <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>trip to the region.</p><p>MICHAELA PEREIRA, CNN ANCHOR: Security breach. How did this teenager get by security, hide inside a plane's wheel well on a five-hour flight to Hawaii and survive? This morning an airport is facing serious questions as doctors say it's amazing he's alive.</p><p>CUOMO: Your NEW DAY starts right

New signs this morning that the country is testing its nuclear capabilities on the eve of President Obama's visit to Asia.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START, everyone.  I'm John Berman.  Good to see you this morning. </p><p>KOSIK:  And I'm Alison Kosik.  It's the half past the hour, and we begin with the first sign that authorities may be re-evaluating the search for Flight 370.  Overnight, a tropical cyclone forced officials to call off the air search, but the underwater search continues, despite growing concern the hunt for Flight 370 may be headed back to square one.  </p><p>Erin McLaughlin live from Perth, Australia this morning.  </p><p>Erin, at this point, they're into their ninth, tenth investigation in the water, and it's turned up nothing.  Where do they go next?  </p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Alison.  Well, officials have been discussing sort of a long-term search plan.  A U.S. Navy official telling CNN that they're talking about the possibility of a long-term search, in the early stages of planning through July, but all eyes still focused on that Bluefin-21.  As far as we know, it's still in the water on that tenth dive, and it's in a really critical point in this mission, because this is the place where they feel the most likely area where they're going to find the black box based on a limited set of information or data that they have.  </p><p>Now, as of yesterday, it was two-thirds of the way finished searching this area, and officials here in Australia say that it could be complete in just a few days.  And at that point, they say they're going to stop and reassess and probably broaden out the search area -- Alison.  </p><p>KOSIK:  And when they broaden out that search area, what have they got to go on at this point that they maybe didn't have before?  Is there any new information coming in?  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, no new information right now.  Right now, they're searching based on the best information they say they have.  They're looking at the area of the second ping that was picked up by that towed pinger locator.  They're searching in a 6-mile radius around that point.  Now once that's exhausted, which again Australian officials say could happen in the next few days, they may potentially, some analysts say, turn to some of the other points where they picked up those signals.  </p><p>There were three other detections made.  They might just broaden out the area in general, possibly along that arc, the half handshake, the so-called half handshake between the Inmarsat satellite and the plane before it went down.  They might search that entire area.  And Malaysian officials talking about them introducing or exploring the possibility of introducing even more submersibles, because the more submersibles they can introduce, the larger the area in which they can search and the quicker they could potentially find any wreckage -- Alison.  </p><p>KOSIK:  All right, Erin McLaughlin live from Perth, Australia.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Thirty-two minutes after the hour.  A heartbreaking scene in South Korea this morning.  The death toll from the tragic ferry disaster rising to 108.  194 others are still listed as missing. Divers pulling one lifeless body after another from the water, from the sunken ship while devastated families just look on.  </p><p>Our Nic Robertson live from Jindo in South Korea this morning.  </p><p>And, Nic, it has been a very, very grim morning there, indeed.  </p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It has.  It really has.  And you can tell that just from sort of the pace at which the bodies are being brought ashore.  It really has picked up today. Police marine ship after police marine ship pulling into the harbor side, unloading the bodies.  They're going into a temporary, tented, white mortuary on the harbor side.  </p><p>And then what we saw were ambulances backing up to the mortuary tent, one, two, three, four at a time, then very slowly, very solemnly, in a very dignified way, stretcher-bearers carrying out each of those bodies, one body into each ambulance.  The ambulance is driven away. Then more ambulances driven in to take their place to take away more bodies.  So for the families, a very tough day.  </p><p>For a few families, the events today, the recovery of the bodies may provide the answers that they want, but for so many more families, it's really, really a matter of waiting for the divers who are still aboard the ship.  A very, very difficult wait there, down at the third and fourth level aboard the ship working in very difficult conditions, visibility poor.  And the tides today slightly slacker, but they're facing debris inside that ship that's blocking their way.  </p><p>So very, very slow, painstaking process aboard the ship and very, very difficult for the families to watch all this unfolding -- John.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Nic, what's the status of the investigation right now, particularly concerning the captain and the crew of this vessel?  </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Well, we know that seven crew members, including the captain, who have been charged, the captain potentially could face life in prison for abandoning the ship.  We have heard from some of the senior crew members, two 1st officers, a chief engineer and one of the 2nd officers was speaking outside a courtroom as they were charged today, describing how this ship had a history of not being able to right itself very easily or very well.  </p><p>They also described how the ship had gone through some extensions. They were asked whether these were legal.  The crews said that they didn't know, but the underlying theme of what they were saying was that this ship had problems, and they said when they were steering it on Wednesday, when it -- when it capsized, that it turned very quickly.  No explanation for this so far.  </p><p>And out at sea, the divers focusing on the rescue, rather than investigating the ship to see what they can discover that might lead to a better understanding of what happened.  At sea, the focus very much the rescue, but on land, we're beginning to learn those details from those senior crew members -- John.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Our Nic Robertson in Jindo, South Korea this morning.  Thanks so much, Nic.  </p><p>KOSIK:  Meantime, there are new worries this morning that North Korea could be closer to conducting a nuclear test.  </p><p>Let's get to Andrew Salmon, who's live in Seoul.  </p><p>So let me ask you this.  The timing of this, this possible movement from North Korea, kind of curious.  </p><p>ANDREW SALMON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Kind of curious, you're right.  What we can say is it's still spring here on the Korean Peninsula.  Always a tense time.  This is when the South Koreans and the U.S. carry out their joint maneuvers.  Two main exercises are finished, but even today and right through Friday, there is the largest ever air defense exercises with aircraft from both the U.S. and South Korea drilling in the skies above the peninsula.  </p><p>So the North Koreans are extremely sensitive to this, and we've seen on North Korean news today Kim Jong-Un himself visiting a North Korean air unit and encouraging them to be prepared to defend their country. But of course, also in even bigger news, U.S. President Barack Obama will be traveling through the region.  He's arriving in South Korea on Friday, leaving Saturday.  </p><p>And the North Korean Foreign Ministry have been berating this trip using a lot of rhetoric, including saying this will bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to the region.  A lot of doomsday rhetoric. But whether, of course, they're prepared to detonate a nuclear device in an underground test site in North Korea while the president is actually in or on the ground, that would be even by North Korean standards an extraordinary provocation.  </p><p>KOSIK:  OK, Andrew Salmon live from Seoul, thanks.  </p><p>And as Andrew said, the latest possible provocation from North Korea comes as President Obama is set to visit the region, leaving today for a trip that will take him to Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea.  But he'll stop first in Washington state to meet with families impacted by a deadly mudslide northeast of Seattle.  The death toll in that slide now stands at 41.  </p><p>BERMAN:  About 37 minutes after the hour right now.  </p><p>Chad Myers here, bravely entering the studio, despite the allergies trying to hold him back.  </p><p>CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: :  Yes, I can see it in the air. Literally, you can see the dust flying around, but it's going to get better today because there's rain on the way.  There is rain in Buffalo already, moving to Pittsburgh, all the way down to Atlanta. So if you're suffering out there, it does get better, at least some of the pollen gets washed away.  A beautiful day in the city today, high of 70.  77 in D.C., 74 in Atlanta.  </p><p>A pretty decent day to fly up and down the East Coast.  It will get bumpy later today, probably around 6:00 or 7:00.  Could see some bumps up and down the East Coast.  Now, it will be bumpy all day in the west.  There's just going to be major, just huge turbulence out here, so expect that if you're flying over the Rockies.  </p><p>High wind warnings for the desert southwest.  Could be 60 to 70-mile- per-hour winds there and dust in the air.  That storm moves to the east for tomorrow, making some severe weather across the Midwest, from Nebraska all the way down to Texas.  </p><p>Talked about Jack here.  Jack kind of hindering the surface search yesterday.  At 35 miles per hour right now.  Yesterday at this time, though, it was 85, so this storm is dying.  </p><p>BERMAN:  All right, Chad Myers.  Thanks so much for a look of the weather, here and off the coast of Australia as well.  </p><p>KOSIK:  And this morning, the U.S. is promising more support to Ukraine.  Vice President Biden is in Kiev for critical meetings with the interim government, but will it be enough to sway tensions with Russia?  We're live with the latest.  Next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BERMAN:  Welcome back to EARLY START, everyone.  At this moment, Vice President Biden is meeting with Ukraine's top leaders in Kiev.  It's a show of support for that country's embattled interim government.  But in the eastern part of Ukraine, pro-Russian gunmen not letting up one bit, seizing more government buildings in a dozen cities and towns.  </p><p>Want to bring in Fred Pleitgen right now live from Kiev.  </p><p>Fred, give us an update on the goal of these meetings amidst this chaos, really, still in the eastern part of the country.  </p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I think chaos is exactly the right word.  One of the things that, of course, these two sides are going to be talking about, the top-level of Ukrainian politicians as well as Joe Biden is going to be that situation in the east of the country.  And apparently, what the acting president of Ukraine told the vice president was that he believes that the Russians have already breached that Geneva agreement that was reached between the U.S., the EU, Russia, as well as Ukraine last week.  And they say that because these pro-Russian separatist groups have taken additional buildings instead of vacating all the buildings that they could and disarming, they feel the agreement's been breached, and the Ukrainians for their part are saying they will react accordingly.  </p><p>So certainly a very volatile situation that the vice president has landed into.  He's walking a very fine line diplomatically, where on the one hand, the U.S., as you know, has threatened additional sanctions against Moscow if it doesn't de-escalate in the coming days. But of course, the U.S. always wants to keep those diplomatic channels with Moscow open.  At the same time, the U.S. wants to prop up the government here in Kiev.  </p><p>Several things that we expect to hear out of a press conference that was supposed to start a couple of minutes ago.  We're now hearing that they're actually running quite late -- is that the U.S. wants to offer economic assistance, technical assistance and help Ukraine, and this is probably the most important point.  Help Ukraine achieve energy security, because they are very dependent on Russian gas, and that's certainly something that the Russians have been using as a weapon in this standoff that they have with Ukraine -- John.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Fred, I want to talk about the pro-Russian militants right now in the eastern part of Ukraine who have taken over these government buildings.  They have shown to be very unresponsive to both the Ukrainian government and to the United States as well.  </p><p>Has Russia, has Moscow, has Vladimir Putin shown any inclination right now to get those pro-Russian militants to move?  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  Zero at this point.  In fact, one of the things that we seem to see is that on the one hand, those pro-Russian militants are saying that they don't feel bound by that agreement that was reached. They say it was not signed on their behalf.  In fact, they're calling for the government here in Kiev to resign before they will lay down their weapons.  And the Russians for their part seem to have a completely different interpretation of that agreement than the West does, that the U.S. does.  </p><p>The U.S. say they have to get out of those buildings immediately.  The Russians say that if those the pro-Russian protesters are supposed to vacate those buildings in the east of the country, they want the square that's behind me, the Maidan, where of course, the revolution took place a couple of months ago, they want that square to be cleared as well.  </p><p>The Russians are also saying that Ukrainian groups who have taken up arms need to lay down those arms before the pro-Russian protesters are set to do that.  So there is still a lot of disagreement between the U.S. and Russia.  </p><p>There was a phone call last night between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and John Kerry, and quite frankly, that did not lead to very much.  So the two sides still very far apart and there really isn't any sign, especially in the east of this country, that there's any de-escalation.  And the U.S. know that any de-escalation has to come from Moscow and be initiated by Moscow -- John.  </p><p>BERMAN:  A rather ominous words from our Fred Pleitgen in Kiev, who says there's been zero movement now towards any kind of diplomatic solution in the eastern part of that country.  </p><p>Fred, thank you very much.  </p><p>KOSIK:  And whether Vice President Biden can even make any headway.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Exactly.  What's to do ?  He's there, but what can he produce while he is there?  </p><p>KOSIK:  Exactly.  </p><p>All right.  Let's take a look at what's coming up on \"NEW DAY,\" Kate Bolduan joins us now.  </p><p>Good morning, Kate.  </p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR, NEW DAY:  Good morning both of you.  We're tracking the latest of course on the search for Flight 370.  The underwater sub, that Bluefin-21 is back in the water scanning the ocean floor but so far has yet to turn up any sign of the missing plane.  If the Bluefin's search doesn't yield any results, the big question is, what happens next?  They are going to start that conversation, they say, and how to plan for a long-term search and what that would mean for all of the resources at hand.  </p><p>We're also going to be live on the ground in South Korea, where the death toll is rising again this morning in that deadly ferry accident. The disaster raises really new worries this morning about passenger ferries worldwide, including here in the United States.  Are they regulated enough to keep travelers safe?  Our maritime experts are going to be weighing in, something probably everyone should listen to, unfortunately -- John and Alison.  </p><p>BERMAN:  All right.  Look forward to seeing that, despite the tone, I think.  </p><p>Kate, great to see you this morning.  </p><p>BOLDUAN:  Thanks, guys.  </p><p>BERMAN:  We'll be tuning in just a few minutes.  </p><p>Meanwhile, 46 minutes after the hour, he is lucky to be alive.  A 16- year-old stowaway who hid inside a wheel well on a flight from California to Hawaii.  This morning, we're taking a closer look at how he survived being 38,000 feet up in the air.  That's coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BERMAN:  No charges this morning for a 16-year-old from California who hopped a jet from California to Hawaii, riding in the 767's wheel well alongside the landing gear.  Doctors are calling it a medical miracle, since in past cases, people who tried hiding in these wheel wells have died of hypothermia or oxygen deprivation, or they've just fallen out of the jet.  But this 16-year-old somehow emerged unharmed, perhaps in a way thanks to the cold temperatures.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. BEN HONIGMAN, ALTITUDE RESEARCH CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO: He probably became unconscious rather quickly at that elevation.  And perhaps with the cold, and if it was in the range of zero to perhaps 30 degrees, then perhaps he went into what we call this slowing down of the machinery state or hibernation that might have protected him and caused him not to need as much oxygen as normally we would if we were exerting ourselves or even sitting here on TV.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN:  Breaking into the airport, of course hiding in that plane, against the law, but police in San Jose say the boy will not face charges.  Investigators are still trying to find out how he managed to slip past security there.  </p><p>KOSIK:  This morning tests are under way to figure out just who was killed in what officials call an unprecedented operation in Yemen, targeting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  Some 65 suspected militants were targeted, but it's not clear yet if any top-level operatives were killed.  A Yemeni official tells CNN that the operation is a joint effort with the U.S., which blames al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for a string of recent plots.  </p><p>BERMAN:  This morning officials in Salt Lake City still trying to figure out what caused a man to charge a witness inside a federal courtroom.  A U.S. Marshal fatally shot Siale Angilau, a reputed gang member, when he reportedly grabbed a pen and charged at the witness, who was testifying about gang life.  Angilau was facing racketeering charges.  He was shot multiple times and died at the hospital.  The judge has declared a mistrial.  </p><p>KOSIK:  We could soon find out more about the Obama administration's legal reasoning for killing an American citizen overseas.  A federal appeals court has told the Justice Department to release key parts of a classified memo used to justify the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki. Intelligence officials say he was a member of al Qaeda and killed him in a 2011 targeted strike in Yemen.  </p><p>The judges said the administration could no longer claim privacy since it has talked openly about the killing and even issued a white paper defending the attack.  It's unclear when or if the memo may be made public.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Two planned executions in Oklahoma now on hold after the state Supreme Court stepped in to a battle over the source of the state's lethal injection drugs.  The inmates, Clayton Lockett and Charles Warner, challenged the constitutionality of a law allowing the state to keep the source of those drugs secret.  Both men have been convicted of rape and murder, and the state says they will die.  It's just a matter of how and when.  </p><p>KOSIK:  A federal appeals court has now been asked to weigh in on the legality of the FAA's ban on private drones.  A Texas-based group that searches for missing people wants the right to use unmanned aircraft in its searches, saying the FAA has no authority to ban them.  An administrative law judge ruled last month that the agency couldn't find a videographer for using a drone because it was essentially a model airplane.  The FAA is appealing that ruling.  </p><p>Coming up, did big tech firms conspire to control each other's hiring practices?  We're going to have details of new e-mails, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KOSIK:  Some biz news for you this morning.  European stocks are trading higher right now.  Futures in the U.S. are mostly flat.  </p><p>One story everyone in Silicon Valley is watching closely, the alleged hiring conspiracy among big tech firms.  A class-action lawsuit accuses a handle of big-name tech firms, including Google, Apple and Intel of agreeing not to poach each other's employees as a way of keeping those employees' salaries low.  </p><p>What's more, the suit names Steve Jobs as the ringleader of all this. There are new documents that were just revealed that show Jobs e- mailing Google chairman Eric Schmidt after a Google recruiter contacted an Apple employee.  Jobs wrote, \"I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this.\"  The Google recruiter was fired.  Other e-mails show executives trying to convince Facebook to join the scheme.  The case is set to go to trial in May.  </p><p>And what's interesting with this case, a lot of it's going to be based on actual e-mails from these top executives, like Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt and, you know, the Intel executives, all their e-mails going back and forth, with the smiley faces and everything.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BERMAN:  Really intrigue there at that very high level.  </p><p>KOSIK:  Yes.  </p><p>BERMAN:  At that very high levels of Silicon Valley.   KOSIK:  All to keep those salaries depressed.  And tech workers saying, wait a minute, we're owed more.  And, you know, it kind of even underscores how tough it is to find top talent for these companies and how competitive these companies are.  </p><p>BERMAN:  Any sense that they might settle before going to the full trial?  </p><p>KOSIK:  That's a good question.  We'll see what happens.  </p><p>BERMAN:  All right.  That is all for us this morning.  Great to have you with us.  \"NEW DAY\" starts right now.  </p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR:  Happening now, part of the search for missing Flight 370 has been suspended as the temp underwater mission is under way with the clock ticking and still no sign of the missing plane.

This morning, part of the search has been suspended, after nine missions under water have turned up nothing. We're live with the latest on the search and what the families are saying this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALISON KOSIK, CNN ANCHOR: Nearly a week after a ferry capsized, hope for survivors beginning to fade. Divers are searching the ship for the nearly 200 still missing, as the ship's operator apologizes and asks for forgiveness. We're live on the coast with the very latest.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: A new possible provocation from North Korea. New signs this morning that the country is testing its nuclear capabilities on the eve of <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>visit to Asia.</p><p/><p>Welcome back to EARLY START, everyone. I'm John Berman. Good to see you this morning.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: And I'm Alison Kosik. It's the half past the hour, and we begin with the first sign that authorities may be re-evaluating the search for Flight 370. Overnight, a tropical cyclone forced officials to call off the air search, but the underwater search continues, despite growing concern the hunt for Flight 370 may be headed back to square one.</p><p/><p>Erin McLaughlin live from Perth, Australia this morning.</p><p/><p>Erin, at this point, they're into their ninth, tenth investigation in the water, and it's turned up nothing. Where do they go next?</p><p/><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Alison. Well, officials have been discussing sort of a long-term search plan. A U.S. Navy official telling CNN that they're talking about the possibility of a long-term search, in the early stages of planning through July, but all eyes still focused on that Bluefin-21. As far as we know, it's still in the water on that tenth dive, and it's in a really critical point in this mission, because this is the place where they feel the most likely area where they're going to find the black box based on a limited set of information or data that they have.</p><p/><p>Now, as of yesterday, it was two-thirds of the way finished searching this area, and officials here in Australia say that it could be complete in just a few days. And at that point, they say they're going to stop and reassess and probably broaden out the search area -- Alison.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: And when they broaden out that search area, what have they got to go on at this point that they maybe didn't have before? Is there any new information coming in?</p><p/><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well, no new information right now. Right now, they're searching based on the best information they say they have. They're looking at the area of the second ping that was picked up by that towed pinger locator. They're searching in a 6-mile radius around that point. Now once that's exhausted, which again Australian officials say could happen in the next few days, they may potentially, some analysts say, turn to some of the other points where they picked up those signals.</p><p/><p>There were three other detections made. They might just broaden out the area in general, possibly along that arc, the half handshake, the so-called half handshake between the Inmarsat satellite and the plane before it went down. They might search that entire area. And Malaysian officials talking about them introducing or exploring the possibility of introducing even more submersibles, because the more submersibles they can introduce, the larger the area in which they can search and the quicker they could potentially find any wreckage -- Alison.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: All right, Erin McLaughlin live from Perth, Australia.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Thirty-two minutes after the hour. A heartbreaking scene in South Korea this morning. The death toll from the tragic ferry disaster rising to 108. 194 others are still listed as missing. Divers pulling one lifeless body after another from the water, from the sunken ship while devastated families just look on.</p><p/><p>Our Nic Robertson live from Jindo in South Korea this morning.</p><p/><p>And, Nic, it has been a very, very grim morning there, indeed.</p><p/><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It has. It really has. And you can tell that just from sort of the pace at which the bodies are being brought ashore. It really has picked up today. Police marine ship after police marine ship pulling into the harbor side, unloading the bodies. They're going into a temporary, tented, white mortuary on the harbor side.</p><p/><p>And then what we saw were ambulances backing up to the mortuary tent, one, two, three, four at a time, then very slowly, very solemnly, in a very dignified way, stretcher-bearers carrying out each of those bodies, one body into each ambulance. The ambulance is driven away. Then more ambulances driven in to take their place to take away more bodies. So for the families, a very tough day.</p><p/><p>For a few families, the events today, the recovery of the bodies may provide the answers that they want, but for so many more families, it's really, really a matter of waiting for the divers who are still aboard the ship. A very, very difficult wait there, down at the third and fourth level aboard the ship working in very difficult conditions, visibility poor. And the tides today slightly slacker, but they're facing debris inside that ship that's blocking their way.</p><p/><p>So very, very slow, painstaking process aboard the ship and very, very difficult for the families to watch all this unfolding -- John.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Nic, what's the status of the investigation right now, particularly concerning the captain and the crew of this vessel?</p><p/><p>ROBERTSON: Well, we know that seven crew members, including the captain, who have been charged, the captain potentially could face life in prison for abandoning the ship. We have heard from some of the senior crew members, two 1st officers, a chief engineer and one of the 2nd officers was speaking outside a courtroom as they were charged today, describing how this ship had a history of not being able to right itself very easily or very well.</p><p/><p>They also described how the ship had gone through some extensions. They were asked whether these were legal. The crews said that they didn't know, but the underlying theme of what they were saying was that this ship had problems, and they said when they were steering it on Wednesday, when it -- when it capsized, that it turned very quickly. No explanation for this so far.</p><p/><p>And out at sea, the divers focusing on the rescue, rather than investigating the ship to see what they can discover that might lead to a better understanding of what happened. At sea, the focus very much the rescue, but on land, we're beginning to learn those details from those senior crew members -- John.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Our Nic Robertson in Jindo, South Korea this morning. Thanks so much, Nic.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: Meantime, there are new worries this morning that North Korea could be closer to conducting a nuclear test.</p><p/><p>Let's get to Andrew Salmon, who's live in Seoul.</p><p/><p>So let me ask you this. The timing of this, this possible movement from North Korea, kind of curious.</p><p/><p>ANDREW SALMON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Kind of curious, you're right. What we can say is it's still spring here on the Korean Peninsula. Always a tense time. This is when the South Koreans and the U.S. carry out their joint maneuvers. Two main exercises are finished, but even today and right through Friday, there is the largest ever air defense exercises with aircraft from both the U.S. and South Korea drilling in the skies above the peninsula.</p><p/><p>So the North Koreans are extremely sensitive to this, and we've seen on North Korean news today Kim Jong-Un himself visiting a North Korean air unit and encouraging them to be prepared to defend their country. But of course, also in even bigger news, U.S. President Barack Obama will be traveling through the region. He's arriving in South Korea on Friday, leaving Saturday.</p><p/><p>And the North Korean Foreign Ministry have been berating this trip using a lot of rhetoric, including saying this will bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to the region. A lot of doomsday rhetoric. But whether, of course, they're prepared to detonate a nuclear device in an underground test site in North Korea while the president is actually in or on the ground, that would be even by North Korean standards an extraordinary provocation.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: OK, Andrew Salmon live from Seoul, thanks.</p><p/><p>And as Andrew said, the latest possible provocation from North Korea comes as <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is set to visit the region, leaving today for a trip that will take him to Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea. But he'll stop first in Washington state to meet with families impacted by a deadly mudslide northeast of Seattle. The death toll in that slide now stands at 41.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: About 37 minutes after the hour right now.</p><p/><p>Chad Myers here, bravely entering the studio, despite the allergies trying to hold him back.</p><p/><p>CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: : Yes, I can see it in the air. Literally, you can see the dust flying around, but it's going to get better today because there's rain on the way. There is rain in Buffalo already, moving to Pittsburgh, all the way down to Atlanta. So if you're suffering out there, it does get better, at least some of the pollen gets washed away. A beautiful day in the city today, high of 70. 77 in D.C., 74 in Atlanta.</p><p/><p>A pretty decent day to fly up and down the East Coast. It will get bumpy later today, probably around 6:00 or 7:00. Could see some bumps up and down the East Coast. Now, it will be bumpy all day in the west. There's just going to be major, just huge turbulence out here, so expect that if you're flying over the Rockies.</p><p/><p>High wind warnings for the desert southwest. Could be 60 to 70-mile- per-hour winds there and dust in the air. That storm moves to the east for tomorrow, making some severe weather across the Midwest, from Nebraska all the way down to Texas.</p><p/><p>Talked about Jack here. Jack kind of hindering the surface search yesterday. At 35 miles per hour right now. Yesterday at this time, though, it was 85, so this storm is dying.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: All right, Chad Myers. Thanks so much for a look of the weather, here and off the coast of Australia as well.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: And this morning, the U.S. is promising more support to Ukraine. Vice President Biden is in Kiev for critical meetings with the interim government, but will it be enough to sway tensions with Russia? We're live with the latest. Next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Welcome back to EARLY START, everyone. At this moment, Vice President Biden is meeting with Ukraine's top leaders in Kiev. It's a show of support for that country's embattled interim government. But in the eastern part of Ukraine, pro-Russian gunmen not letting up one bit, seizing more government buildings in a dozen cities and towns.</p><p/><p>Want to bring in Fred Pleitgen right now live from Kiev.</p><p/><p>Fred, give us an update on the goal of these meetings amidst this chaos, really, still in the eastern part of the country.</p><p/><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think chaos is exactly the right word. One of the things that, of course, these two sides are going to be talking about, the top-level of Ukrainian politicians as well as Joe Biden is going to be that situation in the east of the country. And apparently, what the acting president of Ukraine told the vice president was that he believes that the Russians have already breached that Geneva agreement that was reached between the U.S., the EU, Russia, as well as Ukraine last week. And they say that because these pro-Russian separatist groups have taken additional buildings instead of vacating all the buildings that they could and disarming, they feel the agreement's been breached, and the Ukrainians for their part are saying they will react accordingly.</p><p/><p>So certainly a very volatile situation that the vice president has landed into. He's walking a very fine line diplomatically, where on the one hand, the U.S., as you know, has threatened additional sanctions against Moscow if it doesn't de-escalate in the coming days. But of course, the U.S. always wants to keep those diplomatic channels with Moscow open. At the same time, the U.S. wants to prop up the government here in Kiev.</p><p/><p>Several things that we expect to hear out of a press conference that was supposed to start a couple of minutes ago. We're now hearing that they're actually running quite late -- is that the U.S. wants to offer economic assistance, technical assistance and help Ukraine, and this is probably the most important point. Help Ukraine achieve energy security, because they are very dependent on Russian gas, and that's certainly something that the Russians have been using as a weapon in this standoff that they have with Ukraine -- John.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Fred, I want to talk about the pro-Russian militants right now in the eastern part of Ukraine who have taken over these government buildings. They have shown to be very unresponsive to both the Ukrainian government and to the United States as well.</p><p/><p>Has Russia, has Moscow, has Vladimir Putin shown any inclination right now to get those pro-Russian militants to move?</p><p/><p>PLEITGEN: Zero at this point. In fact, one of the things that we seem to see is that on the one hand, those pro-Russian militants are saying that they don't feel bound by that agreement that was reached. They say it was not signed on their behalf. In fact, they're calling for the government here in Kiev to resign before they will lay down their weapons. And the Russians for their part seem to have a completely different interpretation of that agreement than the West does, that the U.S. does.</p><p/><p>The U.S. say they have to get out of those buildings immediately. The Russians say that if those the pro-Russian protesters are supposed to vacate those buildings in the east of the country, they want the square that's behind me, the Maidan, where of course, the revolution took place a couple of months ago, they want that square to be cleared as well.</p><p/><p>The Russians are also saying that Ukrainian groups who have taken up arms need to lay down those arms before the pro-Russian protesters are set to do that. So there is still a lot of disagreement between the U.S. and Russia.</p><p/><p>There was a phone call last night between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and John Kerry, and quite frankly, that did not lead to very much. So the two sides still very far apart and there really isn't any sign, especially in the east of this country, that there's any de-escalation. And the U.S. know that any de-escalation has to come from Moscow and be initiated by Moscow -- John.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: A rather ominous words from our Fred Pleitgen in Kiev, who says there's been zero movement now towards any kind of diplomatic solution in the eastern part of that country.</p><p/><p>Fred, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: And whether Vice President Biden can even make any headway.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Exactly. What's to do ? He's there, but what can he produce while he is there?</p><p/><p>KOSIK: Exactly.</p><p/><p>All right. Let's take a look at what's coming up on \"NEW DAY,\" Kate Bolduan joins us now.</p><p/><p>Good morning, Kate.</p><p/><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR, NEW DAY: Good morning both of you. We're tracking the latest of course on the search for Flight 370. The underwater sub, that Bluefin-21 is back in the water scanning the ocean floor but so far has yet to turn up any sign of the missing plane. If the Bluefin's search doesn't yield any results, the big question is, what happens next? They are going to start that conversation, they say, and how to plan for a long-term search and what that would mean for all of the resources at hand.</p><p/><p>We're also going to be live on the ground in South Korea, where the death toll is rising again this morning in that deadly ferry accident. The disaster raises really new worries this morning about passenger ferries worldwide, including here in the United States. Are they regulated enough to keep travelers safe? Our maritime experts are going to be weighing in, something probably everyone should listen to, unfortunately -- John and Alison.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: All right. Look forward to seeing that, despite the tone, I think.</p><p/><p>Kate, great to see you this morning.</p><p/><p>BOLDUAN: Thanks, guys.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: We'll be tuning in just a few minutes.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, 46 minutes after the hour, he is lucky to be alive. A 16- year-old stowaway who hid inside a wheel well on a flight from California to Hawaii. This morning, we're taking a closer look at how he survived being 38,000 feet up in the air. That's coming up next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: No charges this morning for a 16-year-old from California who hopped a jet from California to Hawaii, riding in the 767's wheel well alongside the landing gear. Doctors are calling it a medical miracle, since in past cases, people who tried hiding in these wheel wells have died of hypothermia or oxygen deprivation, or they've just fallen out of the jet. But this 16-year-old somehow emerged unharmed, perhaps in a way thanks to the cold temperatures.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>DR. BEN HONIGMAN, ALTITUDE RESEARCH CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO: He probably became unconscious rather quickly at that elevation. And perhaps with the cold, and if it was in the range of zero to perhaps 30 degrees, then perhaps he went into what we call this slowing down of the machinery state or hibernation that might have protected him and caused him not to need as much oxygen as normally we would if we were exerting ourselves or even sitting here on TV.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Breaking into the airport, of course hiding in that plane, against the law, but police in San Jose say the boy will not face charges. Investigators are still trying to find out how he managed to slip past security there.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: This morning tests are under way to figure out just who was killed in what officials call an unprecedented operation in Yemen, targeting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Some 65 suspected militants were targeted, but it's not clear yet if any top-level operatives were killed. A Yemeni official tells CNN that the operation is a joint effort with the U.S., which blames al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for a string of recent plots.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: This morning officials in Salt Lake City still trying to figure out what caused a man to charge a witness inside a federal courtroom. A U.S. Marshal fatally shot Siale Angilau, a reputed gang member, when he reportedly grabbed a pen and charged at the witness, who was testifying about gang life. Angilau was facing racketeering charges. He was shot multiple times and died at the hospital. The judge has declared a mistrial.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: We could soon find out more about the Obama administration's legal reasoning for killing an American citizen overseas. A federal appeals court has told the Justice Department to release key parts of a classified memo used to justify the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki. Intelligence officials say he was a member of al Qaeda and killed him in a 2011 targeted strike in Yemen.</p><p/><p>The judges said the administration could no longer claim privacy since it has talked openly about the killing and even issued a white paper defending the attack. It's unclear when or if the memo may be made public.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Two planned executions in Oklahoma now on hold after the state Supreme Court stepped in to a battle over the source of the state's lethal injection drugs. The inmates, Clayton Lockett and Charles Warner, challenged the constitutionality of a law allowing the state to keep the source of those drugs secret. Both men have been convicted of rape and murder, and the state says they will die. It's just a matter of how and when.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: A federal appeals court has now been asked to weigh in on the legality of the FAA's ban on private drones. A Texas-based group that searches for missing people wants the right to use unmanned aircraft in its searches, saying the FAA has no authority to ban them. An administrative law judge ruled last month that the agency couldn't find a videographer for using a drone because it was essentially a model airplane. The FAA is appealing that ruling.</p><p/><p>Coming up, did big tech firms conspire to control each other's hiring practices? We're going to have details of new e-mails, next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>KOSIK: Some biz news for you this morning. European stocks are trading higher right now. Futures in the U.S. are mostly flat.</p><p/><p>One story everyone in Silicon Valley is watching closely, the alleged hiring conspiracy among big tech firms. A class-action lawsuit accuses a handle of big-name tech firms, including Google, Apple and Intel of agreeing not to poach each other's employees as a way of keeping those employees' salaries low.</p><p/><p>What's more, the suit names Steve Jobs as the ringleader of all this. There are new documents that were just revealed that show Jobs e- mailing Google chairman Eric Schmidt after a Google recruiter contacted an Apple employee. Jobs wrote, \"I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this.\" The Google recruiter was fired. Other e-mails show executives trying to convince Facebook to join the scheme. The case is set to go to trial in May.</p><p/><p>And what's interesting with this case, a lot of it's going to be based on actual e-mails from these top executives, like Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt and, you know, the Intel executives, all their e-mails going back and forth, with the smiley faces and everything.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Really intrigue there at that very high level.</p><p/><p>KOSIK: Yes.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: At that very high levels of Silicon Valley. KOSIK: All to keep those salaries depressed. And tech workers saying, wait a minute, we're owed more. And, you know, it kind of even underscores how tough it is to find top talent for these companies and how competitive these companies are.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Any sense that they might settle before going to the full trial?</p><p/><p>KOSIK: That's a good question. We'll see what happens.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: All right. That is all for us this morning.

Para ello, la agencia ha solicitado a esas compa\u00f1as que revelen todos los detalles sobre esas operaciones[3] incluidas aquellas que por ser ms peque\u00f1as, no conllevaron una investigaci\u00f3n a fondo. Cuntas operaciones? Si la FTC no dice lo contrario, son muchsimas, y han tenido lugar a lo largo de ms de cuatro dcadas. </p><p>Decididamente, a la FTC no le va a faltar el trabajo: hablamos de un abrumador total de 767 operaciones de adquisici\u00f3n llevadas a cabo por las cinco compa\u00f1as desde finales de los a\u00f1os '80, a raz\u00f3n de 235 adquisiciones de Google[4], 112 de Apple[5], 101 de Amazon[6], 82 de Facebook[7] y 237 de Microsoft[8]. Saber a qu operaciones nos referimos no es complicado, cada una de las cinco compa\u00f1as tiene una pgina entera en Wikipedia dedicada \u00fanicamente al seguimiento de sus adquisiciones. Pero como revela una primera inspecci\u00f3n de esas pginas, rellenar los huecos que faltan en las largusimas tablas para conocer los detalles de todas y cada una de las adquisiciones puede ser un trabajo de una magnitud impresionante. A lo largo de su historia, las grandes compa\u00f1as tecnol\u00f3gicas han planteado desde operaciones muy peque\u00f1as, prcticamente acqui-hires[9] que pretendan simplemente incorporar a su estructura a determinadas personas o equipos especializados en temas considerados estratgicos y que, por ser emprendedores, no eran fciles de fichar, hasta adquisiciones descomunales a precios mareantes, como la de Motorola Mobility por parte de Google ($12,500 millones), la de Beats por Apple ($3,000 millones), la de Whole Foods por Amazon ($13,700 millones), la de WhatsApp por Facebook ($19,000 millones) o la de LinkedIn por parte de Microsoft ($26,200 millones). En algunos momentos, el ritmo de adquisiciones de estas compa\u00f1as ha sido demencial prcticamente inabarcable: entre 2010 y 2011, Google adquiri\u00f3 compa\u00f1as a un ritmo aproximado de una a la semana. En mayo de 2019, Tim Cook, CEO de Apple, afirm\u00f3 que su compa\u00f1a adquira una compa\u00f1a cada dos o tres semanas, y que haba adquirido 20 \u00f3 25 compa\u00f1as tan solo en los \u00faltimos seis meses. Durante largos perodos de tiempo, todo aquello que se mova en el panorama tecnol\u00f3gico se presuma que tena una alta probabilidad de ser adquirido por alguna de las big tech. Recopilar datos y detalles de tantas operaciones de adquisici\u00f3n no va a ser sencillo, y supondr un importante reto para la FTC, no solo por lo exhaustivo, sino tambin por la dificultad para trazar la lnea de lo que entra dentro de lo razonable y lo que debe ser considerado como un exceso regulatorio. En su momento, todas esas operaciones pasaron el filtro regulatorio, pero ahora, el tiempo ha demostrado que contribuyeron en gran medida a la construcci\u00f3n esas big tech prcticamente omnipotentes que ahora muchos quieren regular o incluso escindir. Qu lleva a las compa\u00f1as tecnol\u00f3gicas a adquirir otras empresas como si no hubiese un ma\u00f1ana, a dedicar enormes sumas de dinero a la tarea de incorporar talento especializado y activos a su estructura, siendo conscientes como somos de que las operaciones de adquisici\u00f3n plantean casi siempre problemas de encaje cultural y de otros tipos generalmente importantes que tienden a disminuir el hipottico valor que estaban destinadas a generar? La respuesta es clara: hablamos de una industria caracterizada por mrgenes y ganancias elevadas, con abundante generaci\u00f3n de liquidez y dinero fresco, y sobre todo, en la que la velocidad es elevadsima. Una de las razones habituales, de hecho, para muchas adquisiciones en esta industria ha sido la posibilidad de hacerse con una compa\u00f1a antes de que la comprase otro competidor, en modo duelo del Far West en el que gana el primero que desenfunda su pistola. En ese entorno, la exploraci\u00f3n de lo que Steven Johnson en su libro Where good ideas come from[10] llama the adjacent possible tiene que darse lugar a toda velocidad, dado que no faltan competidores dispuestos a llevar a cabo una exploraci\u00f3n similar y a tratar de conquistar esos territorios antes que la propia compa\u00f1a. Hablamos de un contexto en el que simplemente tratar de incorporar talento en el mercado puede enviar se\u00f1ales a los analistas o los competidores sobre futuras lneas de actuaci\u00f3n de la compa\u00f1a, lo que implica que en ocasiones, se prefiera acelerar el proceso incorporando no solo talento aislado, sino estructuras completas o equipos en funcionamiento. Cuando alguien decide explorar una idea dentro de lo que considera su adjacent possible, puede optar, si es un individuo o un grupo de individuos, por crear una compa\u00f1a, convertirse en emprendedor, y desarrollarla desde cero. Si en lugar de ser un individuo es una compa\u00f1a, la opci\u00f3n comienza con el desarrollo de talento interno, contin\u00faa con la incorporaci\u00f3n de talento externo, y sigue con opciones como el acqui-hire o la adquisici\u00f3n de otras compa\u00f1as. En cada uno de estos escalones, ganamos en velocidad y perdemos - seguramente - en dinero y en eficiencia de la operaci\u00f3n, pero en entornos altamente competitivos y sometidos a una gran velocidad, incluso ese dinero y esos posibles complicaciones posteriores pueden merecer la pena. Una buena estrategia de adquisiciones, o un esfuerzo consciente por acomodar bien a las personas involucradas en una operaci\u00f3n de adquisici\u00f3n pueden ser activos muy importantes de cara al xito a largo plazo. Pero las prisas, como siempre, son incompatibles con la buena letra. Y en muchas ocasiones, el inters de la FTC por facilitar el crecimiento y la competitividad de las compa\u00f1as norteamericanas, a las que Donald Trump acaba de referirse nada menos que como a compa\u00f1as MAGA, que hacen a Amrica grande[11], ha llevado a que la aprobaci\u00f3n de las adquisiciones se llevase a cabo como un mero trmite - o por decreto. Ahora, llega el momento de revisar lo que se hizo, de examinar si tuvo sentido, o incluso, en algunos casos, puede que de actuar como si se pudiese dar marcha atrs al reloj y deshacer esas operaciones algo, obviamente, imposible o directamente absurdo. En la mayor parte de los casos, lo que esas adquisiciones tuvieron que ofrecer ya se ha aprovechado, se ha incorporado o se ha destruido, y la posibilidad de que esas compa\u00f1as adquiridas vuelvan al mercado como compa\u00f1as independientes como si nada hubiera pasado es directamente absurda e irracional. Veremos a qu conclusiones llega la FTC. Lanzar una investigaci\u00f3n como esta para terminar diciendo aquello de no pasa nada, todo va bien sera un ridculo importante. Pero determinar que en algunos casos, esas operaciones no debieron haberse permitido es casi peor, porque la b\u00fasqueda de una soluci\u00f3n para ello, a estas alturas, puede ser casi surrealista. Regular las empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas? Seguro, y adems, lo antes posible. Pero mejor no removamos los muertos del pasado, porque podemos acabar comidos por los zombies [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/11/ftc-will-review-past-mergers-by-facebook-google-other-big-tech-companies/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/11/ftc-will-review-past-mergers-by-facebook-google-other-big-tech-companies/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/12/ftc-orders-google-amazon-apple-facebook-and-microsoft-to-reveal-acquisition-data/\">https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/12/ftc-orders-google-amazon-apple-facebook-and-microsoft-to-reveal-acquisition-data/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Apple\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Apple</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Amazon\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Amazon</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acqui-hiring\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acqui-hiring</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://amzn.to/2HnHpdb\">https://amzn.to/2HnHpdb</url> [ 11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/trump-heaps-praise-on-trillion-dollar-tech-club-calling-four-big-companies-maga.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/trump-heaps-praise-on-trillion-dollar-tech-club-calling-four-big-companies-maga.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-EBED128683158153464365375776100021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EBED-128683</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6D-PYG1-F03R-N3KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1384\"/><timeReceived>7:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>El Blog de Enrique Dans</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>Spanish</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001U7O</classCode><className>MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Now the state's voters have a chance to expand its protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest proposal, known as the California Privacy Rights Act, would create a state agency to serve as a privacy watchdog and would offer more rights to consumers. It would also create a raft of compliance work for banks and other companies, especially tech firms that rely heavily on users' personal data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The financial services industry would retain limited exemptions that were included in the earlier law.</p><p>The measure was approved last week for the statewide ballot in November after its backers obtained more than 623,000 signatures.</p><p>\"We've come a long way in the two years since passing the landmark California Consumer Privacy Act,\" Alastair Mactaggart, the lead backer of both measures, said in a press release. \"But during these times of unprecedented uncertainty, we need to ensure that the laws keep pace with the ever-changing ways corporations and other entities are using our data.\"</p><p>Californians for Consumer Privacy, the group that Mactaggart founded, obtained enough signatures in 2018 to put a sweeping data privacy proposal onto the statewide ballot. Instead, the groupagreed to a last-minute compromise, passed by the state legislature, that took effect in January of this year.</p><p>This year, Mactaggart's group appears more likely to carry the fight to the ballot box. Polls show strong public support for data privacy protections. While the ballot initiative will likely be opposed by industry groups, it remains to be seen how much money big tech companies in Silicon Valley will be willing to put into an opposition campaign.</p><p>Banks and credit unions that operate in California have already invested considerable time and money to comply with the 2018 law. Financial industry lawyers said that the latest measure, if it becomes law, will require more investments.</p><p>\"It's a pretty significant overhaul,\" said Nate Taylor, a lawyer in the privacy and data security practice at Morrison &amp; Foerster. \"Very little is left unchanged.\"</p><p>The proposal would create a watchdog, called the California Privacy Protection Agency, that would be governed by a five-member board and have the authority to enforce the law.</p><p>New protections for California's nearly 40 million residents would include the right to correct inaccurate personal information and the right to opt out of advertiser use of precise geolocation data.</p><p>\"I do think this initiative provides greater rights to consumers,\" said Amanda Lawrence, a lawyer at Buckley LLP.</p><p>Banks would maintain an existing exemption for personal information collected, sold or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a 1999 federal law. An exemption for personal data gathered during the course of business-to-business communications would get a temporary extension. The bulk of the ballot initiative would take effect on Jan. 1, 2023.</p><p>The proposal would bring the nation's largest state into closer alignent with the European Union's data privacy requirements, according to lawyers at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell. In a written analysis, the Davis Polk lawyers called the smaller gap between those two regimes a boon, but not a panacea, for firms that already comply with EU rules.</p><p>Under California's existing law, state residents have the right to obtain copies of their personal information from specific companies, as well as the right to demand the deletion of their data. The two-year-old law has served as the model for legislative proposals on data privacy in roughly 15 other states, according to a 2019 analysis by the law firm Baker Hostetler.</p><p>Efforts to pass a federal data privacy law have long been stymied by disagreements that pit industry groups against privacy advocates and state regulators. One key sticking point iswhether national standards should serve as a ceiling or a floor for state regulation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-00000172f1ded3eca976fbdfec2100011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607M-4JC1-F06X-W07N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"651\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Data is solidly entrenched as a key asset in our economy, and as a result, the issues around it demanded a significant level of attention. Clearly, privacy and data security-related data issues were dominant in 2019. The GDPR, CCPA and other privacy regulations garnered much consideration and resources, and with GDPR enforcement[1] ongoing and CCPA enforcement right around the corner, the coming year will be an important one to watch. As data generation and collection technologies continued to evolve, privacy issues evolved as well. In 2019, we saw many novel issues involving mobile[2], biometric[3] and connected car[4] Facial recognition technology generated a fair amount of litigation[5], and presented concerns regarding the possibility of intrusive governmental surveillance (prompting some municipalities, such as San Francisco[6], to ban its use by government agencies). Because data has proven to be so valuable, innovators continue to develop new and sometimes controversial technological approaches to collecting data. </p><p>The legal issues abound. For example, in the past year, we have been advising on the implications of an ongoing dispute between the City Attorney of Los Angeles and an app operator over geolocation data collection[7], as well as a settlement between the FTC and a personal email management service[8] over access to 'e-receipt' data. We have entertained multiple questions from clients about the unsettled legal terrain surrounding web scraping and have been closely following developments in this area, including the blockbuster hiQ Ninth Circuit ruling[9] from earlier this year. As usual, the pace of technological innovation has outpaced the ability for the law to keep up. Data security is now regularly a boardroom and courtroom issue, with data breaches, phishing, ransomware attacks and identity theft (and cyberinsurance) the norm. Meanwhile, consumers are experiencing deeper and deeper 'breach fatigue[10]' with every breach notice they receive. While the U.S. government has not yet been able to put into place general national data security legislation, states and certain regulators are acting to compel data collectors to take reasonable measures to protect consumer information (e.g., New York's newly-enacted SHIELD Act[11]) and IoT device manufacturers to equip connected devices with certain security features appropriate to the nature and function of the devices secure (e.g., California's IoT security law[12], which becomes effective January 1, 2020). Class actions over data breaches and security lapses are filed regularly, with mixed results. Many organizations have focused on the opportunistic issues associated with new and emerging sources of data. They seek to use 'big data' - either sourced externally or generated internally - to advance their operations. They are focused on understanding the sources of the data and their lawful rights to use such data. They are examining new revenue opportunities[13] offered by the data, including the expansion of existing lines, the identification of customer trends[14] or the creation of new businesses (including licensing anonymized data to others). Moreover, data was a key asset in many corporate transactions in 2019. Across the board in M...private equity, capital markets, finance and some real estate transactions, data was the subject of key deal points, sometimes intensive diligence, and often difficult negotiations. Consumer data has even become a national security issue, as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS[15]), expanded under a 2018 law, began to scrutinize more and more technology deals involving foreign investment, including those involving sensitive personal data. I am not going out on a limb in saying that 2020 and beyond promise many interesting developments in 'big data,' privacy and data security.Social Media under FireSocial media platforms experienced an interesting year. The power of the medium came into even clearer focus, and not necessarily in the most flattering light. In addition to privacy issues, fake news, hate speech, bullying, political interference, revenge porn, defamation and other problems came to light. Executives of the major platforms have been on the hot seat in Washington[16], and there is clearly bipartisan unease with the influence of social media in our society. Many believe that the status quo cannot continue. Social media platforms are working to build self-regulatory systems to address these thorny issues, but the work continues. Still, amidst the bluster and criticism, it remains to be seen whether the calls to 'break up' the big tech companies[17] will come to pass or whether Congress's ongoing debate of comprehensive data privacy reform will lead to legislation that would alter the basic practices of the major technology platforms (and in turn, many of the data collection and sharing done by today's businesses). We have been working with clients, advising them of their rights and obligations as platforms, as contributors to platforms, and in a number of other ways in which they may have a connection to such platforms or the content or advertising appearing on such platforms.What does 2020 hold? Will Washington's withering criticism of the tech world translate into any tangible legislation or regulatory efforts? Will Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - the law that underpins user generated content on social media and generally the availability of user generated content on the internet and apps - be curtailed? Will platforms be asked to accept more responsibility for third party content appearing on their services?While these issues are playing out in the context of the largest social media platforms, any legislative solutions to these problems could in fact extend to others that do not have the same level of compliance resources available. Unless a legislative solution includes some type of 'size of person' test or room to adapt technical safeguards to the nature and scope of a business's activities or sensitivity of the personal information collected, smaller providers could be shouldered with a difficult and potentially expensive compliance burden. Thus, it remains to see how the focus on social media and any attempt to solve the issues it presents may affect online communications more generally.Quantum LeapsFollowing the momentum of the passage of the National Quantum Initiative at the close of 2018, a significant level of resources has been invested[18] into quantum computing in 2019. This bubble of activity culminated in Google announcing[19] a major milestone in quantum computing. Interestingly, IBM suggests[20] that it wasn't quite as significant as Google claimed. In any case, the development of quantum computing[21] in the U.S. has progressed a great deal in 2019, and many organizations will continue to focus on it as a priority in 2020. Reports state that China has dedicated billions[22] to build a Chinese national laboratory for quantum computing, among other related R...roducts, a development that has gotten the attention of Congress and the Pentagon. This may be the beginning of the 21st century's great technological race[23]. What is at stake? The implications are huge[24]. It is expected that ultimately, quantum computers will be able to solve complex computations exponentially faster - as much as 100 million times faster \u2014 than classic computers. The opportunities this could present are staggering[25]. As are the risks and dangers[26]. For example, for all its benefits, the same technology could quickly crack the digital security that protects online banking and shopping and secure online communications. Many organizations are concerned about the advent of quantum computing[27]. But given that it will be a reality in the future, what should you be thinking about now? While not a real threat for 2020 or the near-term thereafter, it would be wise to think about it if one is anticipating investing in long-term infrastructure solutions. Will quantum computing render the investment obsolete? Or, will quantum computing present a security threat to that infrastructure? It is not too early to think about these issues, and for example, technologists have been hard at work developing quantum-proof blockchain protocols[28]. It would at least be prudent to understand the long-term roadmap of technology suppliers to see if they have even thought about quantum computing, and if so, to see to how they see quantum computing impacting their solutions and services.Artificial IntelligenceWe have seen significant level of deployment in the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning landscape this past year. According to the Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2019[29], AI adoption by organizations (of at least one function or business unit) is increasing globally. Many businesses across many industries are deploying some level of AI into their businesses. However, the same report notes that many companies employing AI solutions might not be taking steps to mitigate the risks from AI, beyond cybersecurity. We have advised clients on those risks, and in certain cases have been able to apportion exposure amongst multiple parties involved in the implementation. In addition, we have also seen the beginning of regulation in AI, such as California's chatbot law[30], New York's recent passage of a law (S.2302[31]) prohibiting consumer reporting agencies and lenders[32] from using the credit scores of people in a consumer's social network to determine that individual's credit worthiness, or the efforts of a number of regulators to regulate the use of AI in hiring decisions[33].We expect 2020 to be a year of increased adoption of AI, coupled with an increasing sense of apprehension about the technology. There is a growing concern that AI and related technologies will continue to be 'weaponized[34]' in the coming year, as the public and the government[35] express concern over 'deepfakes' (including the use of voice deepfakes of CEOs to commit fraud). And, of course, the warnings of people like Elon Musk[36] and Bill Gates[37], as they discuss AI, cannot be ignored.BlockchainWe have been very busy in 2019 helping clients learn about blockchain technologies, including issues related to smart contracts and cryptocurrency. 2019 was largely characterized by pilots[38], trials[39], tests[40] and other limited applications of blockchain in enterprise and infrastructure applications as well as a significant level of activity in tokenization of assets[41], cryptocurrency investments[42], and the building of businesses related to the trading and custody of digital assets[43]. Our blog, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.blockchainandthelaw.io\">www.blockchainandthelaw.io</url>[44] keeps readers abreast of key new developments and we hope our readers have found our published articles on blockchain and smart contracts[45] helpful.Looking ahead to 2020, regulators such as the SEC[46], FinCEN[47], IRS[48] and CFTC[49] are still watching the cryptocurrency space closely. Gone are the days of ill-fated 'initial coin offerings' and today, security token offerings, made in compliance with the securities laws, are increasingly common.[50] Regulators are beginning to be more receptive to cryptocurrency, as exemplified by the New York State Department of Financial Services revisiting of the oft-maligned 'bitlicense' requirement in New York.[51]Beyond virtual currency, I believe some of the most exciting developments of blockchain solutions in 2020 will be in supply chain management[52] and other infrastructure uses of blockchain. 2019 was characterized by experimentation and trial. We have seen many[53] successes[54] and some slower starts. In 2020, we expect to see an increase in adoption. Of course, the challenge for businesses is to really understand whether blockchain is an appropriate solution for the particular need. Contrary to some of the hype out there, blockchain is not the right fit for every technology need, and there are many circumstances where a traditional client-server model is the preferred approach. For help in evaluating whether blockchain is in fact a potential fit for a technology need, this article[55] may be helpful.Other 2020 DevelopmentsInterestingly, one of the companies that has served as a form of leading indicator in the adoption of emerging technologies is Walmart. Walmart was one of the first major companies to embrace supply use of blockchain[56], so what is Walmart looking at for 2020? A recent Wall Street Journal article discusses its interest and investment in 5G communications and edge computing[57]. We too have been assisting clients in those areas, and expect them to be active areas of activity in 2020.Edge computing[58], which is related to 'fog' computing[59], which is, in turn,related to cloud computing, is simply put, the idea of storing and processing information at the point of capture, rather than communicating that information to the cloud or a central data processing location for storage and processing. According to the WSJ article[60], Walmart plans on building edge computing capability for other businesses to hire (following to some degree Amazon's model for AWS). The article also talks about Walmart's interest in 5G technology, which would work hand-in-hand with its edge computing network.Our experience with clients suggest that Walmart may be onto something. Edge and fog computing, 5G and the growth of the 'Internet of Things' are converging and will offer the ability for businesses to be faster, cheaper and more profitable. Of course this convergence also will tie back to the issues we discussed earlier, such as data, privacy and data security, artificial intelligence and machine learning. In general, this convergence will increase even more the technical abilities to process and use data (which would conceivably require regulation[61] that would feature privacy and data security protections that are consumer-friendly, yet balanced so they do not stifle the economic and technological benefits of 5G).This past year has presented a host of fascinating technology-based legal issues, and 2020 promises to hold more of the same. We will continue to keep you posted!We hope you had a good 2019, and we want to wish all of our readers a very happy and safe holiday season and a great New Year![View source[62].] [ 1]:       \u00a0

Data: The Issues of the Year Data presented a wide variety of challenging legal issues in 2019. Data is solidly entrenched as a key asset in our economy, and as a result, the issues around it demanded a significant level of attention. Clearly, privacy and data security-related data issues were dominant in 2019. The GDPR, CCPA and other privacy regulations garnered much consideration and resources, and withGDPR enforcement[4]ongoing and CCPA enforcement right around the corner, the coming year will be an important one to watch. As data generation and collection technologies continued to evolve, privacy issues evolved as well. In 2019, we saw many novel issues involvingmobile[5],biometric[6]andconnected car[7] Facial recognition technologygenerated a fair amount of litigation, and presented concerns regarding the possibility of intrusive governmental surveillance (prompting some municipalities, such asSan Francisco[8], to ban its use by government agencies). Because data has proven to be so valuable, innovators continue to develop new and sometimes controversial technological approaches to collecting data. </p><p>The legal issues abound. For example, in the past year, we have been advising on the implications of anongoing dispute between the City Attorney of Los Angeles and an app operator over geolocation data collection[9], as well as asettlement between the FTC and a personal email management service[10]over access to 'e-receipt' data. We have entertained multiple questions from clients about the unsettled legal terrain surrounding web scraping and have been closely following developments in this area, including theblockbusterhiQNinth Circuit ruling[11]from earlier this year. As usual, the pace of technological innovation has outpaced the ability for the law to keep up. Data security is now regularly a boardroom and courtroom issue, with data breaches, phishing, ransomware attacks and identity theft (and cyberinsurance) the norm. Meanwhile, consumers are experiencing deeper and deeper 'breach fatigue[12]' with every breach notice they receive. While the U.S. government has not yet been able to put into place general national data security legislation, states and certain regulators are acting to compel data collectors to take reasonable measures to protect consumer information (e.g.,New York's newly-enacted SHIELD Act[13]) and IoT device manufacturers to equip connected devices with certain security features appropriate to the nature and function of the devices secure (e.g., California'sIoT security law[14], which becomes effective January 1, 2020). Class actions over data breaches and security lapses are filed regularly, with mixed results. Many organizations have focused on the opportunistic issues associated with new and emerging sources of data. They seek to use 'big data' - either sourced externally or generated internally - to advance their operations. They are focused on understanding the sources of the data and their lawful rights to use such data. They are examiningnew revenue opportunities[15]offered by the data, including the expansion of existing lines, theidentification of customer trends[16]or the creation of new businesses (including licensing anonymized data to others). Moreover, data was a key asset in many corporate transactions in 2019. Across the board in M...private equity, capital markets, finance and some real estate transactions, data was the subject of key deal points, sometimes intensive diligence, and often difficult negotiations. Consumer data has even become a national security issue, as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS[17]), expanded under a 2018 law, began to scrutinize more and more technology deals involving foreign investment, including those involving sensitive personal data. I am not going out on a limb in saying that 2020 and beyond promise many interesting developments in 'big data,' privacy and data security. Social Media under Fire Social media platforms experienced an interesting year. The power of the medium came into even clearer focus, and not necessarily in the most flattering light. In addition to privacy issues, fake news, hate speech, bullying, political interference, revenge porn, defamation and other problems came to light. Executives of the major platforms have been on thehot seat in Washington[18], and there is clearly bipartisan unease with the influence of social media in our society. Many believe that the status quo cannot continue. Social media platforms are working to build self-regulatory systems to address these thorny issues, but the work continues. Still, amidst the bluster and criticism, it remains to be seen whether the calls to'break up' the big tech companies[19]will come to pass or whether Congress's ongoing debate of comprehensive data privacy reform will lead to legislation that would alter the basic practices of the major technology platforms (and in turn, many of the data collection and sharing done by today's businesses). We have been working with clients, advising them of their rights and obligations as platforms, as contributors to platforms, and in a number of other ways in which they may have a connection to such platforms or the content or advertising appearing on such platforms.What does 2020 hold? Will Washington's withering criticism of the tech world translate into any tangible legislation or regulatory efforts? Will Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - the law that underpins user generated content on social media and generally the availability of user generated content on the internet and apps - be curtailed? Will platforms be asked to accept more responsibility for third party content appearing on their services?While these issues are playing out in the context of the largest social media platforms, any legislative solutions to these problems could in fact extend to others that do not have the same level of compliance resources available. Unless a legislative solution includes some type of 'size of person' test or room to adapt technical safeguards to the nature and scope of a business's activities or sensitivity of the personal information collected, smaller providers could be shouldered with a difficult and potentially expensive compliance burden. Thus, it remains to see how the focus on social media and any attempt to solve the issues it presents may affect online communications more generally. Quantum Leaps Following the momentum of the passage of the National Quantum Initiative at the close of 2018, a significant level of resources has beeninvested[20]into quantum computing in 2019. This bubble of activity culminated in Googleannouncing[21]a major milestone in quantum computing. Interestingly, IBMsuggests[22]that it wasn't quite as significant as Google claimed. In any case, thedevelopment of quantum computing[23]in the U.S. has progressed a great deal in 2019, and many organizations will continue to focus on it as a priority in 2020. Reports state that China has dedicatedbillions[24]to build a Chinese national laboratory for quantum computing, among other related R...roducts, a development that has gotten the attention of Congress and the Pentagon. This may be the beginning of the 21stcentury'sgreat technological race[25]. What is at stake?The implications are huge[26]. It is expected that ultimately, quantum computers will be able to solve complex computations exponentially faster - as much as 100 million times faster \u2014 than classic computers. The opportunities this could present arestaggering[27]. As are therisks and dangers[28]. For example, for all its benefits, the same technology could quickly crack the digital security that protects online banking and shopping and secure online communications. Many organizations are concerned about the advent of quantum computing[29]. But given that it will be a reality in the future, what should you be thinking about now? While not a real threat for 2020 or the near-term thereafter, it would be wise to think about it if one is anticipating investing in long-term infrastructure solutions. Will quantum computing render the investment obsolete? Or, will quantum computing present a security threat to that infrastructure? It is not too early to think about these issues, and for example, technologists have been hard at workdeveloping quantum-proof blockchain protocols[30]. It would at least be prudent to understand the long-term roadmap of technology suppliers to see if they have even thought about quantum computing, and if so, to see to how they see quantum computing impacting their solutions and services.  Artificial Intelligence We have seen significant level of deployment in the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning landscape this past year. According to theArtificial Intelligence Index Report 2019[31], AI adoption by organizations (of at least one function or business unit) is increasing globally. Many businesses across many industries are deploying some level of AI into their businesses. However, the same report notes that many companies employing AI solutions might not be taking steps to mitigate the risks from AI, beyond cybersecurity. We have advised clients on those risks, and in certain cases have been able to apportion exposure amongst multiple parties involved in the implementation. In addition, we have also seen the beginning of regulation in AI, such asCalifornia's chatbot law[32], New York's recent passage of a law (S.2302[33])prohibiting consumer reporting agencies and lenders[34]from using the credit scores of people in a consumer's social network to determine that individual's credit worthiness, or the efforts of a number of regulators toregulate the use of AI in hiring decisions[35].We expect 2020 to be a year of increased adoption of AI, coupled with an increasing sense of apprehension about the technology. There is a growing concern that AI and related technologies will continue to be 'weaponized[36]' in the coming year, as the public and thegovernment[37]express concern over 'deepfakes' (including the use of voice deepfakes of CEOs to commit fraud). And, of course, the warnings of people likeElon Musk[38]andBill Gates[39], as they discuss AI, cannot be ignored. Blockchain We have been very busy in 2019 helping clients learn about blockchain technologies, including issues related to smart contracts and cryptocurrency. 2019 was largely characterized bypilots[40],trials[41], tests[42]and other limited applications of blockchain in enterprise and infrastructure applications as well as a significant level of activity intokenization of assets[43],cryptocurrency investments[44], and the building of businessesrelated to the trading and custody of digital assets[45]. Our blog,<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.blockchainandthelaw.io\">www.blockchainandthelaw.io</url>[46]keeps readers abreast of key new developments and we hope our readers have found our published articles on blockchain andsmart contracts[47]helpful.Looking ahead to 2020, regulators such as theSEC[48],FinCEN[49],IRS[50]andCFTC[51]are still watching the cryptocurrency space closely. Gone are the days of ill-fated 'initial coin offerings' and today,security token offerings, made in compliance with the securities laws, are increasingly common.[52]Regulators are beginning to be more receptive to cryptocurrency, as exemplified by the New York State Department of Financial Servicesrevisiting of the oft-maligned 'bitlicense' requirement in New York.[53]Beyond virtual currency, I believe some of the most exciting developments of blockchain solutions in 2020 will be insupply chain management[54]and other infrastructure uses of blockchain. 2019 was characterized by experimentation and trial. We have seenmany[55]successes[56]and some slower starts. In 2020, we expect to see an increase in adoption. Of course, the challenge for businesses is to really understand whether blockchain is an appropriate solution for the particular need. Contrary to some of the hype out there, blockchain is not the right fit for every technology need, and there are many circumstances where a traditional client-server model is the preferred approach. For help in evaluating whether blockchain is in fact a potential fit for a technology need, thisarticle[57]may be helpful. Other 2020 Developments Interestingly, one of the companies that has served as a form of leading indicator in the adoption of emerging technologies is Walmart. Walmart was one of the first major companies to embrace supply use of blockchain[58], so what is Walmart looking at for 2020?A recentWall Street Journalarticle discusses its interest and investment in 5G communications and edge computing[59]. We too have been assisting clients in those areas, and expect them to be active areas of activity in 2020.Edge computing[60], which is related to 'fog' computing[61], which is, in turn, related to cloud computing, is simply put, the idea of storing and processing information at the point of capture, rather than communicating that information to the cloud or a central data processing location for storage and processing. According to theWSJ article[62], Walmart plans on building edge computing capability for other businesses to hire (following to some degree Amazon's model for AWS). The article also talks about Walmart's interest in 5G technology, which would work hand-in-hand with its edge computing network.Our experience with clients suggest that Walmart may be onto something. Edge and fog computing, 5G and the growth of the 'Internet of Things' are converging and will offer the ability for businesses to be faster, cheaper and more profitable. Of course this convergence also will tie back to the issues we discussed earlier, such as data, privacy and data security, artificial intelligence and machine learning. In general, this convergence will increase even more the technical abilities to process and use data (which wouldconceivably require regulation[63]that would feature privacy and data security protections that are consumer-friendly, yet balanced so they do not stifle the economic and technological benefits of 5G).This past year has presented a host of fascinating technology-based legal issues, and 2020 promises to hold more of the same. We will continue to keep you posted!We hope you had a good 2019, and we want to wish all of our readers a very happy and safe holiday season and a great New Year! 2019 Proskauer Rose LLP.
