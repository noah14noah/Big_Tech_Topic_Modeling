To give you the equivalent, the US has given billions. The -- a drop in the ocean. Perhaps they need to step up the financial aid. </p><p>The story that anyone in financial markets around the world was watching yesterday was the Federal Reserve and the Wall Street Journal has a story, as do many others. As expected, no change to the cost of rolling. What it looks like December could be the time when they make their move. -- cost of borrowing. This was never about whether they were going to hike interest rates. It was about whether or not December was on the table. The Mark -- interest rates were priced out but economists said they could go. The reason for that is the commentary from their voters. Many of them suggested that they still saw scope for a December rate rise and this is exactly what the statement indicates. That December is still on the table. They have taken out a couple of references to China or to global pressures, that were there last month, or in September. China perhaps not as much of a feature. When you think about it, the last meeting they were very much on the back foot of the massive volatility in Shanghai and that being felt around the world. That's really calming down now. Certainly it risks appetite. There is still cloud about your global growth. And weaker than expected growth in parts of Europe and the US. A lot of the data is uncertain. One interesting thing is that by putting those references in, the markets were very un- nerved and usually if a central bank suggested rates could stay lower for later, appetite improves. In September, there was a sell-off in the stock market and markets were very spooked about how bad the outlook should be. So, no relaxing between now and the end of the year for us.

It's not a quote, not mandatory, but it is encouraging big oven is to get more women on the board. The Sydney Morning Herald talks about a woman who is very successful and she works full-time as a barrister but she has to pay a massive bill to cover the cost at home to enable her to be at work. Companies have generally recognised that there is this massive pool of talent that they aren't tapping properly in women. They are often better educated and have lots of skills to offer. Although the UK have backed away from having a mandate, they do recognise that we have to increase the role of women in senior roles and if they don't do it in the UK they are worried they will fall behind other countries. But of course 6.5 thousand dollars every week in order for this barrister to work! She needs three cleaners. Her main point is that she is buying back her time with her family. Isn't she buying back two hours a day? But the money is towards business costs as well. Tabs on of those cleaners is to clean her business as well. I think it is unfair to say it is that much, because all companies have those types of costs. But it's a huge amount of money. And it's not just about women, it's about family and the role men have. The chores they perhaps have to take on in order to facilitate women being able to take on the more senior roles. It's a story we will talk about again and again. Thanks so much for coming in.

It was just a thought I had. </p><p>We are talking about Yahoo. This story has two elements, the issue of security - Yahoo in the process of being sold to a rise in and all this press coming out about massive security breaches years ago but now Russian spies are indicted over this process. It is getting definitely more complicated than what it looked like at the beginning when it seemed like it was a security hack which Yahoo failed to disclose. I remember when this came up in December there was talk about why it took them so long to disclose this which led to the buyer demanding in the price be slashed a bid. --A bit. The problem is, of course, now we have the second element to it which is adding that Russian government did benefit from the data that was captured. Russia, once again - we hear the term hacking and Russia comes up again. It is a rift between the two countries. We have been having the debate of involvement in Russian spies and hacking the presidential campaign as well so there are many issues. He like this story? It is an interesting one because it shows that central banks in the US are moving in a different direction than the ones here in Europe. The Bank of England expected to remain tight on any further interest rate moves. And the back of Japan. We see divergences between central banks. The Fed is for casting and economic growth of 2% in 2018 and it is substantially lower than what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has been promising. It puts the Fed at a difficult point because it does not want to be seen as if it is contradicting the President but at the same time it has been challenged by Mr Trump in going forward and negotiating international finance regulations say that is an interesting point to look at. Germany's call for free trade at the G20, is that going against the bilateral agreement suggested by <person><nameText>Donald Trump? </nameText></person>Gelling followed the two countries are on a different path here. We recently had US government officials said there is nothing that speaks against the US negotiating at unilaterally with Germany which is not feasible from a German point of view because we aren't members of the EU. Germany has an affected much from free trade and it is interesting to see that this statement has been put forward a head of the start of the G20 ministers meeting on Friday because it seems is the Germany is trying to prepare the ground for quite a strong statement on free trade and keeping trade and shying away from detection is on. Thank you very much indeed. -- protectionism. A picture of Nelson Mandela because on the 17th of March, 1992, of the white man are tea decided to end apartheid. Always enjoy your company in the studio. Thank you and have a really good day. We will see you very soon. Take care. Hi there. Well, for some of us Wednesday was the warmest day of the year so far, with temperatures up into the high teens. Thursday not as warm for many of us, so a rather more changeable day, there'll be more cloud around for a good few and for some there will be some rain courtesy of this front coming in off the Atlantic. It is a cold front, hence the lower temperatures, not a huge amount of rain on it but there will be some and it will be tracking into more north-western parts of the UK as we start the day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-ab7ecc93eda1411f848b21e240d12549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N3J-C491-DY08-351T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TVEyes, Inc.

Well, for some of us Wednesday was the warmest day of the year so far, with temperatures up into the high teens. Thursday not as warm for many of us, so a rather more changeable day, there'll be more cloud around for a good few and for some there will be some rain courtesy of this front coming in off the Atlantic. It is a cold front, hence the lower temperatures, not a huge amount of rain on it but there will be some and it will be tracking into more north-western parts of the UK as we start the day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-6854749592d444129ff036413090f0b2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N3J-6JB1-DY08-319H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TVEyes, Inc.

Well, for some of us Wednesday was the warmest day of the year so far, with temperatures up into the high teens. Thursday not as warm for many of us, so a rather more changeable day, there'll be more cloud around for a good few and for some there will be some rain courtesy of this front coming in off the Atlantic. It is a cold front, hence the lower temperatures, not a huge amount of rain on it but there will be some and it will be tracking into more north-western parts of the UK as we start the day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-89a626ad3c6b4e43910e971387f76d43</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SE2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N3J-6JB1-DY08-318P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TVEyes, Inc.

Well, for some of us Wednesday was the warmest day of the year so far, with temperatures up into the high teens.

This story has two elements, the issue of security - Yahoo in the process of being sold to a rise in and all this press coming out about massive security breaches years ago but now Russian spies are indicted over this process. It is getting definitely more complicated than what it looked like at the beginning when it seemed like it was a security hack which Yahoo failed to disclose. I remember when this came up in December there was talk about why it took them so long to disclose this which led to the buyer demanding in the price be slashed a bid. --A bit. The problem is, of course, now we have the second element to it which is adding that Russian government did benefit from the data that was captured. Russia, once again - we hear the term hacking and Russia comes up again. It is a rift between the two countries. We have been having the debate of involvement in Russian spies and hacking the presidential campaign as well so there are many issues. He like this story? It is an interesting one because it shows that central banks in the US are moving in a different direction than the ones here in Europe. The Bank of England expected to remain tight on any further interest rate moves. And the back of Japan. We see divergences between central banks. The Fed is for casting and economic growth of 2% in 2018 and it is substantially lower than what President Trump has been promising. It puts the Fed at a difficult point because it does not want to be seen as if it is contradicting the President but at the same time it has been challenged by Mr Trump in going forward and negotiating international finance regulations say that is an interesting point to look at. Germany's call for free trade at the G20, is that going against the bilateral agreement suggested by Donald Trump? Gelling followed the two countries are on a different path here. We recently had US government officials said there is nothing that speaks against the US negotiating at unilaterally with Germany which is not feasible from a German point of view because we aren't members of the EU. Germany has an affected much from free trade and it is interesting to see that this statement has been put forward a head of the start of the G20 ministers meeting on Friday because it seems is the Germany is trying to prepare the ground for quite a strong statement on free trade and keeping trade and shying away from detection is on. Thank you very much indeed. -- protectionism. A picture of Nelson Mandela because on the 17th of March, 1992, of the white man are tea decided to end apartheid. Always enjoy your company in the studio. Thank you and have a really good day. We will see you very soon. Take care. Hi there. Well, for some of us Wednesday was the warmest day of the year so far, with temperatures up into the high teens. Thursday not as warm for many of us, so a rather more changeable day, there'll be more cloud around for a good few and for some there will be some rain courtesy of this front coming in off the Atlantic. It is a cold front, hence the lower temperatures, not a huge amount of rain on it but there will be some and it will be tracking into more north-western parts of the UK as we start the day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-4676af4a80ec4722aeadc67fe4c38976</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N3J-C491-DY08-3513-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TVEyes, Inc.

We may well be heading towards the final few weeks of winter now, but actually, the weather is feeling almost springlike, some slightly milder conditions certainly on the cards over the next few days. This was the scene taken near Eastbourne by one of our Weather Watchers on Monday. Some blue sky, a bit of sunshine around too. Now, as we head through the course of the next few days, still quite a lot of dry weather. There'll be a little rain across northern and western parts of the UK. Things turning mild by day, but we've still got a few chilly nights to come, could be the odd spot of frost around, perhaps a bit of mistiness around too. But you can see the yellow colours moving in from the south-west gradually over the next couple of days, introducing that milder air. The blue colours, the colder air, kept at bay for now. So through Tuesday morning, then, it will be quite a chilly start across much of England and Wales, particularly in the south and the east. We've got more cloud from the word go further north and west. A few spots of rain for parts of northern England, but also for Scotland and for Northern Ireland as well, as a frontal system just moves its way gradually south-eastwards through the day. It should brighten up for Scotland and for Northern Ireland during the afternoon, as those south-westerly winds help to break up the cloud. A bit of rain lingering for north-west England, but central and southern and eastern England should stay dry through the day. Now, temperatures up to between around 10-13 degrees, so a little above average really for this time of year. Now, as we move through Tuesday night and on into Wednesday, high pressure sits towards the south. We've still got this frontal system, which is just pushing its way gradually further north-eastwards moving on into Wednesday morning. So, through the day on Wednesday, still quite cloudy across northern and western parts of the UK. A few spots of rain, particularly for parts of Scotland. England and Wales certainly staying</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-d7cf9d56b0f044c6a798e7bbdf6e8cc1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDC-M4F1-DY08-32SM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We may well be heading towards the final few weeks of winter now, but actually, the weather is feeling almost springlike, some slightly milder conditions certainly on the cards over the next few days. This was the scene taken near Eastbourne by one of our Weather Watchers on Monday. Some blue sky, a bit of sunshine around too. Now, as we head through the course of the next few days, still quite a lot of dry weather. There'll be a little rain across northern and western parts of the UK. Things turning mild by day, but we've still got a few chilly nights to come, could be the odd spot of frost around, perhaps a bit of mistiness around too. But you can see the yellow colours moving in from the south-west gradually over the next couple of days, introducing that milder air. The blue colours, the colder air, kept at bay for now. So through Tuesday morning, then, it will be quite a chilly start across much of England and Wales, particularly in the south and the east. We've got more cloud from the word go further north and west. A few spots of rain for parts of northern England, but also for Scotland and for Northern Ireland as well, as a frontal system just moves its way gradually south-eastwards through the day. It should brighten up for Scotland and for Northern Ireland during the afternoon, as those south-westerly winds help to break up the cloud. A bit of rain lingering for north-west England, but central and southern and eastern England should stay dry through the day. Now, temperatures up to between around 10-13 degrees, so a little above average really for this time of year. Now, as we move through Tuesday night and on into Wednesday, high pressure sits towards the south. We've still got this frontal system, which is just pushing its way gradually further north-eastwards moving on into Wednesday morning. So, through the day on Wednesday, still quite cloudy across northern and western parts of the UK. A few spots of rain, particularly for parts of Scotland. England and Wales certainly staying</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SE-96a116bfbfc846808edff0879f63f86d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDC-M4F1-DY08-32SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We may well be heading towards the final few weeks of winter now, but actually, the weather is feeling almost springlike, some slightly milder conditions certainly on the cards over the next few days. This was the scene taken near Eastbourne by one of our Weather Watchers on Monday. Some blue sky, a bit of sunshine around too. Now, as we head through the course of the next few days, still quite a lot of dry weather. There'll be a little rain across northern and western parts of the UK. Things turning mild by day, but we've still got a few chilly nights to come, could be the odd spot of frost around, perhaps a bit of mistiness around too. But you can see the yellow colours moving in from the south-west gradually over the next couple of days, introducing that milder air. The blue colours, the colder air, kept at bay for now. So through Tuesday morning, then, it will be quite a chilly start across much of England and Wales, particularly in the south and the east. We've got more cloud from the word go further north and west. A few spots of rain for parts of northern England, but also for Scotland and for Northern Ireland as well, as a frontal system just moves its way gradually south-eastwards through the day. It should brighten up for Scotland and for Northern Ireland during the afternoon, as those south-westerly winds help to break up the cloud. A bit of rain lingering for north-west England, but central and southern and eastern England should stay dry through the day. Now, temperatures up to between around 10-13 degrees, so a little above average really for this time of year. Now, as we move through Tuesday night and on into Wednesday, high pressure sits towards the south. We've still got this frontal system, which is just pushing its way gradually further north-eastwards moving on into Wednesday morning. So, through the day on Wednesday, still quite cloudy across northern and western parts of the UK. A few spots of rain, particularly for parts of Scotland. England and Wales certainly staying</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-7203f6faa6cc4b4689e5f3df8a3d99ff</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDC-M4F1-DY08-32SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We may well be heading towards the final few weeks of winter now, but actually, the weather is feeling almost springlike, some slightly milder conditions certainly on the cards over the next few days. This was the scene taken near Eastbourne by one of our Weather Watchers on Monday. Some blue sky, a bit of sunshine around too. Now, as we head through the course of the next few days, still quite a lot of dry weather. There'll be a little rain across northern and western parts of the UK. Things turning mild by day, but we've still got a few chilly nights to come, could be the odd spot of frost around, perhaps a bit of mistiness around too. But you can see the yellow colours moving in from the south-west gradually over the next couple of days, introducing that milder air. The blue colours, the colder air, kept at bay for now. So through Tuesday morning, then, it will be quite a chilly start across much of England and Wales, particularly in the south and the east. We've got more cloud from the word go further north and west. A few spots of rain for parts of northern England, but also for Scotland and for Northern Ireland as well, as a frontal system just moves its way gradually south-eastwards through the day. It should brighten up for Scotland and for Northern Ireland during the afternoon, as those south-westerly winds help to break up the cloud. A bit of rain lingering for north-west England, but central and southern and eastern England should stay dry through the day. Now, temperatures up to between around 10-13 degrees, so a little above average really for this time of year. Now, as we move through Tuesday night and on into Wednesday, high pressure sits towards the south. We've still got this frontal system, which is just pushing its way gradually further north-eastwards moving on into Wednesday morning. So, through the day on Wednesday, still quite cloudy across northern and western parts of the UK. A few spots of rain, particularly for parts of Scotland.

We may well be heading towards the final few weeks of winter now, but actually, the weather is feeling almost springlike, some slightly milder conditions certainly on the cards over the next few days. This was the scene taken near Eastbourne by one of our Weather Watchers on Monday. Some blue sky, a bit of sunshine around too. Now, as we head through the course of the next few days, still quite a lot of dry weather. There'll be a little rain across northern and western parts of the UK. Things turning mild by day, but we've still got a few chilly nights to come, could be the odd spot of frost around, perhaps a bit of mistiness around too. But you can see the yellow colours moving in from the south-west gradually over the next couple of days, introducing that milder air. The blue colours, the colder air, kept at bay for now. So through Tuesday morning, then, it will be quite a chilly start across much of England and Wales, particularly in the south and the east. We've got more cloud from the word go further north and west. A few spots of rain for parts of northern England, but also for Scotland and for Northern Ireland as well, as a frontal system just moves its way gradually south-eastwards through the day. It should brighten up for Scotland and for Northern Ireland during the afternoon, as those south-westerly winds help to break up the cloud. A bit of rain lingering for north-west England, but central and southern and eastern England should stay dry through the day. Now, temperatures up to between around 10-13 degrees, so a little above average really for this time of year. Now, as we move through Tuesday night and on into Wednesday, high pressure sits towards the south. We've still got this frontal system, which is just pushing its way gradually further north-eastwards moving on into Wednesday morning. So, through the day on Wednesday, still quite cloudy across northern and western parts of the UK. A few spots of rain, particularly for parts of Scotland.

We may well be heading towards the final few weeks of winter now, but actually, the weather is feeling almost springlike, some slightly milder conditions certainly on the cards over the next few days. This was the scene taken near Eastbourne by one of our Weather Watchers on Monday. Some blue sky, a bit of sunshine around too. Now, as we head through the course of the next few days, still quite a lot of dry weather. There'll be a little rain across northern and western parts of the UK. Things turning mild by day, but we've still got a few chilly nights to come, could be the odd spot of frost around, perhaps a bit of mistiness around too. But you can see the yellow colours moving in from the south-west gradually over the next couple of days, introducing that milder air. The blue colours, the colder air, kept at bay for now. So through Tuesday morning, then, it will be quite a chilly start across much of England and Wales, particularly in the south and the east. We've got more cloud from the word go further north and west. A few spots of rain for parts of northern England, but also for Scotland and for Northern Ireland as well, as a frontal system just moves its way gradually south-eastwards through the day. It should brighten up for Scotland and for Northern Ireland during the afternoon, as those south-westerly winds help to break up the cloud. A bit of rain lingering for north-west England, but central and southern and eastern England should stay dry through the day. Now, temperatures up to between around 10-13 degrees, so a little above average really for this time of year. Now, as we move through Tuesday night and on into Wednesday, high pressure sits towards the south. We've still got this frontal system, which is just pushing its way gradually further north-eastwards moving on into Wednesday morning. So, through the day on Wednesday, still quite cloudy across northern and western parts of the UK. A few spots of rain, particularly for parts of Scotland. England and Wales certainly staying</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-903c623768374ebba5847b928e7c9252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDC-M4F1-DY08-32T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We may well be heading towards the final few weeks of winter now, but actually, the weather is feeling almost springlike, some slightly milder conditions certainly on the cards over the next few days. This was the scene taken near Eastbourne by one of our Weather Watchers on Monday. Some blue sky, a bit of sunshine around too. Now, as we head through the course of the next few days, still quite a lot of dry weather. There'll be a little rain across northern and western parts of the UK. Things turning mild by day, but we've still got a few chilly nights to come, could be the odd spot of frost around, perhaps a bit of mistiness around too. But you can see the yellow colours moving in from the south-west gradually over the next couple of days, introducing that milder air. The blue colours, the colder air, kept at bay for now. So through Tuesday morning, then, it will be quite a chilly start across much of England and Wales, particularly in the south and the east. We've got more cloud from the word go further north and west. A few spots of rain for parts of northern England, but also for Scotland and for Northern Ireland as well, as a frontal system just moves its way gradually south-eastwards through the day. It should brighten up for Scotland and for Northern Ireland during the afternoon, as those south-westerly winds help to break up the cloud. A bit of rain lingering for north-west England, but central and southern and eastern England should stay dry through the day. Now, temperatures up to between around 10-13 degrees, so a little above average really for this time of year. Now, as we move through Tuesday night and on into Wednesday, high pressure sits towards the south. We've still got this frontal system, which is just pushing its way gradually further north-eastwards moving on into Wednesday morning. So, through the day on Wednesday, still quite cloudy across northern and western parts of the UK. A few spots of rain, particularly for parts of Scotland. England and Wales certainly staying</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YN-497b3a39c5a044be88c7bbc61b7b0ce2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDC-M4F1-DY08-32SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402030</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

It should brighten up for Scotland and for Northern Ireland during the afternoon, as those south-westerly winds help to break up the cloud. A bit of rain lingering for north-west England, but central and southern and eastern England should stay dry through the day. Now, temperatures up to between around 10-13 degrees, so a little above average really for this time of year. Now, as we move through Tuesday night and on into Wednesday, high pressure sits towards the south. We've still got this frontal system, which is just pushing its way gradually further north-eastwards moving on into Wednesday morning.

We may well be heading towards the final few weeks of winter now, but actually, the weather is feeling almost springlike, some slightly milder conditions certainly on the cards over the next few days. This was the scene taken near Eastbourne by one of our Weather Watchers on Monday. Some blue sky, a bit of sunshine around too. Now, as we head through the course of the next few days, still quite a lot of dry weather. There'll be a little rain across northern and western parts of the UK. Things turning mild by day, but we've still got a few chilly nights to come, could be the odd spot of frost around, perhaps a bit of mistiness around too. But you can see the yellow colours moving in from the south-west gradually over the next couple of days, introducing that milder air. The blue colours, the colder air, kept at bay for now. So through Tuesday morning, then, it will be quite a chilly start across much of England and Wales, particularly in the south and the east. We've got more cloud from the word go further north and west. A few spots of rain for parts of northern England, but also for Scotland and for Northern Ireland as well, as a frontal system just moves its way gradually south-eastwards through the day. It should brighten up for Scotland and for Northern Ireland during the afternoon, as those south-westerly winds help to break up the cloud. A bit of rain lingering for north-west England, but central and southern and eastern England should stay dry through the day. Now, temperatures up to between around 10-13 degrees, so a little above average really for this time of year. Now, as we move through Tuesday night and on into Wednesday, high pressure sits towards the south. We've still got this frontal system, which is just pushing its way gradually further north-eastwards moving on into Wednesday morning.

We may well be heading towards the final few weeks of winter now, but actually, the weather is feeling almost springlike, some slightly milder conditions certainly on the cards over the next few days. This was the scene taken near Eastbourne by one of our Weather Watchers on Monday. Some blue sky, a bit of sunshine around too. Now, as we head through the course of the next few days, still quite a lot of dry weather. There'll be a little rain across northern and western parts of the UK. Things turning mild by day, but we've still got a few chilly nights to come, could be the odd spot of frost around, perhaps a bit of mistiness around too. But you can see the yellow colours moving in from the south-west gradually over the next couple of days, introducing that milder air. The blue colours, the colder air, kept at bay for now. So through Tuesday morning, then, it will be quite a chilly start across much of England and Wales, particularly in the south and the east. We've got more cloud from the word go further north and west. A few spots of rain for parts of northern England, but also for Scotland and for Northern Ireland as well, as a frontal system just moves its way gradually south-eastwards through the day. It should brighten up for Scotland and for Northern Ireland during the afternoon, as those south-westerly winds help to break up the cloud. A bit of rain lingering for north-west England, but central and southern and eastern England should stay dry through the day. Now, temperatures up to between around 10-13 degrees, so a little above average really for this time of year. Now, as we move through Tuesday night and on into Wednesday, high pressure sits towards the south. We've still got this frontal system, which is just pushing its way gradually further north-eastwards moving on into Wednesday morning. So, through the day on Wednesday, still quite cloudy across northern and western parts of the UK. A few spots of rain, particularly for parts of Scotland. England and Wales certainly staying</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-2f26a3bf79e447cf9c6a836ad3e5d60a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDC-M4F1-DY08-32T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

It's not a quote, not mandatory, but it is encouraging big oven is to get more women on the board. The Sydney Morning Herald talks about a woman who is very successful and she works full-time as a barrister but she has to pay a massive bill to cover the cost at home to enable her to be at work. Companies have generally recognised that there is this massive pool of talent that they aren't tapping properly in women. They are often better educated and have lots of skills to offer.

Mark Zuckerberg is in India are trying to tap up the market there. Smart move? I think it is almost inevitable. Although India is their second biggest market for Facebook, after the US, he still says there are is 1 billion people not online. Obviously this is an untapped resource. From India's point of view, it's huge. This massive untapped potential coming from technology and the internet. It's inevitable that the big tech companies are moving in there. Let's talk about two stories in one. The FT, review into gender equality aims for women to hold a 33% of all board seats. This is a UK government backed idea. It's not a quote, not mandatory, but it is encouraging big oven is to get more women on the board. The Sydney Morning Herald talks about a woman who is very successful and she works full-time as a barrister but she has to pay a massive bill to cover the cost at home to enable her to be at work. Companies have generally recognised that there is this massive pool of talent that they aren't tapping properly in women. They are often better educated and have lots of skills to offer. Although the UK have backed away from having a mandate, they do recognise that we have to increase the role of women in senior roles and if they don't do it in the UK they are worried they will fall behind other countries. But of course 6.5 thousand dollars every week in order for this barrister to work! She needs three cleaners. Her main point is that she is buying back her time with her family. Isn't she buying back two hours a day? But the money is towards business costs as well. Tabs on of those cleaners is to clean her business as well. I think it is unfair to say it is that much, because all companies have those types of costs. But it's a huge amount of money. And it's not just about women, it's about family and the role men have. The chores they perhaps have to take on in order to facilitate women being able to take on the more senior roles. It's a story we will talk about again and again. Thanks so much for coming in.

I don't agree at all. Labour voted to trigger Article 50, they didn't have to vote that way, they could have said... Most Labour members and Momentum members do not want this form of Brexit. We had a Tantric dance from Jeremy Corbyn towards the referendum. </p><p>We still haven't got a clear policy from Labour but they voted for Article 50 two years ago, coming up to the deadline now, what do they expect will happen? Article 50 set in train a process where we would leave the EU with or without a deal. People will find it farcical for you to say this is the Labour Party's problem because the Conservatives cannot agree a line amongst themselves and we saw from Philip Hammond today, he set aside additional money for a no deal exit which is just three weeks away and if Conservative MPs come around to the government's deal, that money will be available for public services but doesn't that seem like a threat? I don't think it is a threat. It's a statement of fact that if we manage to move on from this impasse, which is paralysing the country, he's right to say there will be some money to loosen up public spending but I'm not trying to blame Labour, I'm just saying parliamentarians on both sides who oppose the deal are pursuing different fantasy versions, that applies to Conservative Eurosceptics but also to every Labour MP who voted for Article 50. This is the deal. There is no other deal, you might be able to tweak it but there are three choices, stop Brexit, leave with no deal or leave with a version of the deal. US singer R Kelly has just been released from prison. The embattled star walked out of the Cook County Jail on Saturday for the second time in two weeks, after paying more than $160,000 in overdue child support. The singer has previously spent three nights in jail after he was unable to post bond after being charged in four sex abuse cases. Allegations the singer denies. I promise you, we are going to straighten all this stuff out. That's all I can say right now, but I promise you. Thank you. Hallelujah. Please take my hand. Two climbers have been rescued following an avalanche in the Scottish Highlands. The pair were climbing on part of the three Sisters ridges in Glencoe - and had been missing since yesterday. Both men were suffering from hypothermia when they were found - and one has been taken to hospital by helicopter. For the second time this week, US analysts have reported activity at a military site in North Korea. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Nearly 90 ferry passengers have been injured in Japan when the high speed boat they were travelling on collided with an object in the water, thought to be a whale. The Japanese Coast Guard said five people were seriously injured in the accident which occurred just before the ferry was due to arrive on Sado island, following a short trip from the mainland. It is believed the boat collided with a whale, as both humpbacks and minkes are often found in the area. Internet users should have greater control over personal data to ensure their own safety online. It's part of a proposal to change the way big tech companies are regulated. It follows a report from The House of Lords Communications Committee which says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had viewed graphic images about self harm online. Molly's father has said he believes social media was partly to blame for her death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online, and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nation state, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in the Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies, but if we think they need to do things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications Committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the Committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering the digital world, but no one body has complete oversight, so the Lords recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protections given to people in the real world to apply online.

The headlines: Jeremy Hunt tells his fellow Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson to \"man up\" and face him in a TV debate this week. The Conservative Party will start to feel cheated of having a proper leadership campaign if the front runner isn't prepared to subject himself to the scrutiny of TV debates, to the scrutiny of media interviews. President Trump imposes new sanctions against Iran - as tensions continue to rise between the two countries. </p><p>A man is sentenced to life in prison - for pushing one man onto the tracks of the London Underground - and trying to do the same to another. Senior Facebook executive Sir Nick Clegg says the company should play a 'mature role' in advocating - rather than shunning - regulation. Heavy rain and flash flooding have caused disruption across parts And coming up - we talk to Liam Gallagher about politics, knife crime and Oasis. The inquest into the London Bridge attack has heard that the man who owned the gym used by all three killers has been asked to hand over his phone to be examined. Sajeel Shahid ran the Ummah Fitness Centre in East London where the attack ringleader Khuram Butt worked. Mr Shahid denies he knew what the three men were plotting. From the Old Bailey, here's our correspondent Richard Lister. Just after midnight, a week before the carnage on London Bridge and Borough Market, the three attackers are outside the Ummah Fitness Centre in East London. It's a place they know well. Khuram Butt, the ringleader, worked in the Ummah Fitness Centre for months, and all three are thought to have trained there. But the owner of this gym, Sajeel Shahid, repeatedly refused to be interviewed by police in the aftermath of the attacks, despite the fact that he had another connection to Butt as well. Mr Shahid founded this Islamic school nearby, where Butt taught the Koran to children aged between three and seven. And analysis of the attackers' phones showed dozens of calls and hundreds of texts between Butt and Mr Shahid. Today in court, though, he gave his side of the story. Dominic Adamson represents one of the bereaved families and said... Mr Shahid, whose face we can't show for legal reasons, said... Mr Shahid said that his colleagues at the gym also used his phone, and any communications with Butt on it would have been about his work there. He was asked whether he'd hand it over to police for examination, but so far he has declined. Police say they found no other links between Mr Shahid and the attackers after the carnage two years ago, and in court today he condemned it, saying if he'd known what they were up to, he'd have called the police. How do we curb the extraordinary power of the tech giants? It's the question of our age. In recent years Facebook, in particular, has been criticised over privacy, harmful content and the way data is used. Today the former Lib Dem leader Sir Nick Clegg, who now works for the company, accepted there was what he called a pressing need for new rules to govern the industry. He's says that Facebook will create an Oversight Board to adjudicate on these matters. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, looks at whether it will work. What kind of Internet do you want? The one most of us experience today, a largely Californian world dominated by a few tech giants? Or the more authoritarian approach of China which has its own tech giants. Facebook answer Nick Clegg are betting that the next and best Internet is more regulated. And more European. His first speech was in Brussels in January. Today he in Berlin. This morning he strongly refuted claims that as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have shared all of this information with a select committee in Westminster and elsewhere and have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There's a lot of weight on the word significant. Facebook don't always know everything about who is advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. In the end, this is not something that big tech companies in the Nite Estates or elsewhere can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-a18c3601594a4edf873a1caf4bbaa692</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-X3R1-JBH6-C116-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

While the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it will deal with a potentially vast number of complaints, or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. </p><p>The talk today was of a tech clash, a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as democratic societies, to harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be there material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the Internet before China does. I've been speaking to Damian Collins, Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee - who led an enquiry into Facebook earlier this year. He teld me scrutiny must come from an outside regulatory body. I welcome any move Facebook would take to try to bring more scrutiny to their practices. But this has to be done by an outside body that is independent of Facebook and with the legal powers to launch investigations into the company when things go wrong. Otherwise we are in a position where we are largely reliant on Facebook deciding what it will share with us, and if there are independent investigations, seeking to frame the remit of those investigations. If anyone will have confidence in this process we need a proper regulator, just as we have in broadcasting with Ofcom, a proper regulator with teeth that can investigate when things go wrong. Nick Clegg also said today there was no evidence of Russian interference. I know you have posted on Twitter again refusing back. There is, Facebook themselves have told us in the past that they did find a small amount of evidence that Russians try to buy adverts during the referendum. We know there was a substantial activity from Russian news organisations during the referendum as well, which had a very high shower voice. This is a pattern of behaviour that has run through the recent European elections, we've seen it in America and around the world. The Russians and other bad actors around the world are exploiting social media to spread their messages and disrupt the politics in other countries, and it has only been through external investigations, parliamentary inquiries, investigative journalists, that we have got to know anything about this. Facebook have been entirely reactive times failing to acknowledge the scale of the problem. Can you explain how you think the regulation should operate? Do you think breaking up these big tech giants would help? In terms of regulation we need to establish in law that companies have a clear duty of care to users, and that means acting against known sources of harmful and illegal content. We should create an independent regulatory body, or give Ofcom the task of assessing whether companies are being effective enough at taking down this harmful and illegal content. If they don't, they should have the power, just as they do with data protection issues, they should have the power to fine companies and run investigations to understand what has gone wrong. Let's take a look at some of the other main stories this hour on BBC News. The number of cases uncovered by a maternity review at hospitals in Shropshire has more than doubled. An investigation by NHS Improvement found more than 300 new cases of concern at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust. They're in addition to more than 250 cases already under investigation by the independent maternity review. The former deputy prime minister and Labour peer Lord Prescott has been admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke. The 81-year-old - who was taken ill on Friday - has praised the staff at Hull Royal Infirmary's A&amp;E and stroke units. His former cabinet colleague - Alan Johnson - says he is now talking and is \"over the worst\". A man has been charged with trying to steal one of the oldest surviving copies of Magna Carta from Salisbury Cathedral. Alarms were set off at the cathedral last year when an attempt was made to smash the glass box surrounding the ancient manuscript. The Magna Carta was not damaged, and nobody was injured in the incident. 46-year-old Mark Royden, from Devon, will appear in court on Friday over attempted theft and criminal damage. The UK's first gambling addiction clinic for children and young adults will open in London in September. It's funded by NHS England and aims to support people aged 13-25. An estimated 450,000 children regularly bet, either with friends, on fruit machines, or online.

We need to go further and faster to reduce the time it takes to remove terrorist content online. While the government pressurises social media giants like Facebook and Twitter, there are still plenty of places where you can find extremist rhetoric. </p><p>In old media and in plain sight. You are just not aware of it if you don't understand the language. In Walthamstow, east London, the early morning papers arrive at a local newsagent. Among the tabloids and free sheets is this paper, which originates in Pakistan, which is printed in Urdu. It recently paid tribute to terrorists Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar, calling them warriors of Islam and beacons of light, and even referred to one of the world's most wanted as a renowned spiritual personality. In addition this freesheet has carried adverts calling for sectarian boycotts.

Television channels are also being used to deliver extremist rhetoric in foreign languages. Earlier this year the Birmingham -based satellite channel was fined by Ofcom after a contributor repeated a parable saying that whoever comes across a Jew, they should slay him immediately. We asked the Department of media and culture to respond to this material and they said the government will work with the appropriate regulators to tackle or remove extremist content and hate speech that breaches regulatory thresholds. Meanwhile, these publications continue to land outside mosques and community centres. We can only hope that they don't fall into the wrong hands. Martin Bashir, BBC News. Royal Mail workers have voted in favour of strike action in the first ballot under tough new striker laws. 110,000 workers took part in the ballot with nine out of ten voting to go on strike for the first time since it was privatised four years ago. The union said its executive will meet next week to decide on strike dates, which could take place over Christmas.

They have until Friday before they have to reveal a prototype. Every year, the BBC's 100 Women series celebrates the stories of women around the world. This year, we are doing something a little bit different. challenging teams of women from Over the next month, we are across the world to find solutions to some of our biggest problems - illiteracy and sexual harassment on gender inequality in sport, public transportation. But we're starting here - the first challenge to tackle in Silicon Valley? The glass ceiling. the front line in the Silicon Valley is certainly battle for gender equality in the work place. A series of scandals have rocked some of the big tech just one in ten senior positions companies and a recent study showed here are held by women. for Sasha and Lea, All of this rings true they're starting their careers in tech here in Silicon Valley and have in some of the smaller firms where already experienced routine sexism they have interned.
